Until now, Cohen exclusively followed the official GameStop handle, but as of today, he has added Bitcoin Magazine to his follow list. This comes on the heels of a much-discussed photograph that surfaced two weeks ago showing Cohen with Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). 👀 Go on king 👑 https://t.co/ApTV3WwTaj — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) February 20, 2025 Will Gamestop Buy Bitcoin? GameStop has periodically found itself at the center of Bitcoin-related conjecture, particularly since the pandemic era “meme stock” phenomenon. At that time, a theory posted on Wall Street Bets—a popular Reddit forum—proposed that the gaming retailer, viewed by many as a relic of brick-and-mortar retail, was primed for a turnaround. Widespread retail buying propelled the share price upward, challenging major hedge funds that had shorted the stock. The resulting clash was widely likened to a “David vs. Goliath” scenario. The Bitcoin connection emerged as the pandemic-driven mania intersected with discourse on decentralized finance. Some observers drew parallels between the grassroots support for GameStop and the way Bitcoin was embraced as a hedge against systemic corruption in traditional finance. Since then, theories have circulated that GameStop could adopt a corporate Bitcoin strategy, potentially mirroring MicroStrategy’s aggressive move into BTC. Two weeks ago, Cohen posted a photo on X in which he appeared alongside Michael Saylor, as reported by Bitcoinist. Given Saylor’s reputation as a high-profile advocate for corporate BTC treasury strategies—he spearheads the acquisition of nearly 500,000 BTC at Strategy—many in the Bitcoin sphere speculated that Cohen might be seeking Saylor’s counsel. However, caution soon followed. According to two unnamed sources cited by CNBC, Saylor has no direct involvement in any potential GameStop plan to buy Bitcoin. The rumors remain just that: speculation that has yet to be confirmed by either Cohen or GameStop. Fueling these rumors is the fact that GameStop reported having around $4.616 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of October 31, 2024. Tim Kotzman, host of “The Bitcoin Treasuries Podcast,” recently highlighted GameStop’s investment policy that grants Cohen “the authority to invest […] in cryptocurrencies without requiring shareholder or board approval.” “If GameStop $GME were to invest its $4.6 billion cash reserves into BTC, it would acquire approximately 48,000 BTC,” wrote analyst Han Akamatsu on X, noting that such a position would make GameStop the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, surpassing MARA Holdings but still behind Strategy. However, such predictions are heavily speculative. GameStop has dabbled in NFTs and blockchain projects in the past, but there is no official indication that the company is imminently acquiring Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded at $97,708.

The price has been closing between $2,650 and $2,750 for the past week, creating uncertainty in the short term. With ETH facing selling pressure and unable to reclaim the $2,800 mark, investors are growing concerned about its ability to recover. Related Reading: Solana Sweeps Lows But Recovers – Can Bulls Reclaim $185 by Friday? Despite the recent choppy price action, some analysts believe Ethereum could be gearing up for a bullish move. Crypto expert Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis on X, stating that Ethereum has been forming a bullish pattern on the daily time frame. If this pattern plays out, ETH could see a strong breakout in the coming days. Ethereum is holding at crucial demand levels, making the next move critical for its short-term direction. If buyers step in and reclaim the $2,800 level, it could signal a trend reversal and open the door for a rally above $3,000. However, failure to hold support could lead to further downside, increasing selling pressure. With uncertainty looming, traders are closely watching ETH’s price action for confirmation of its next move. Ethereum Consolidation Continues Ethereum investors are trying to stay calm amid ongoing volatility, but fear continues to grow that ETH could see further downside if it fails to reclaim key levels. The price remains stuck in a tight range, trading between crucial liquidity levels of short-term demand and supply. Market sentiment is divided—some investors anticipate a deeper correction and prolonged consolidation, while others believe Ethereum is on the verge of a recovery rally. Runefelt’s analysis on X states that Ethereum is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern and could break out “any hour now.” According to Runefelt, the target for this potential breakout is $3,055, a level that could serve as a turning point for ETH’s short-term trend. However, Ethereum must first reclaim the $2,800 mark and hold above it to confirm the start of a recovery phase. If Ethereum successfully breaks above this resistance, it could trigger a strong rally, pushing prices back toward the $3,000 level. On the other hand, failure to hold support could lead to another wave of selling pressure. With uncertainty looming, all eyes are on ETH as traders await confirmation of its next major move. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Structure – Time For A Comeback? With Ethereum trading at a critical juncture, the coming days will be crucial in determining its short-term direction. If bulls sustain momentum and push the price above key resistance levels, confidence in a recovery rally will grow. Price Testing Short-Term Supply Ethereum is trading at $2,750 after nearly two weeks of struggling to reclaim the $2,700 level. While bulls have held above key support levels, ETH remains stuck below crucial resistance, making price direction uncertain. The most critical level that bulls must reclaim is the $2,800 mark, which has acted as a strong supply zone for weeks. If Ethereum closes above the $2,800 level and holds above it, bullish momentum could build up, leading to a breakout. The next major target would be the 200-day Moving Average, which sits around $2,930. A push above this moving average would signal strength and open the door for ETH to test the $3,000 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Realized Profit Reveals Strong Support Level – Time For A Breakout? However, if ETH fails to break above $2,800 and faces rejection, the market could see renewed selling pressure. This scenario would likely send ETH back toward the $2,600 level, testing lower demand zones. With Ethereum trading in a tightening range, a breakout or breakdown seems imminent. Bulls need to step up and reclaim lost ground quickly, or bears may take control and push ETH into lower price levels.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Analyst Says PEPE Price Must Break This Resistance Level For 150% Surge Toward ATHs,2025-02-20 21:30:11+00:00,"The PEPE price is currently trading within a Falling Wedge pattern, a historically bullish indicator that suggests an imminent breakout. A crypto analyst predicts that a decisive move above key resistance levels could trigger a 150% rally towards new all-time highs for PEPE.    Key Resistance To Ignite PEPE Price Rally Over the past few weeks, Pepe, the popular frog-themed meme coin, has been stuck in a downtrend, consistently rejecting off of a descending resistance trendline. The meme coin had initially experienced significant gains earlier this year. However, with the recent volatility and the decline in the broader market, PEPE and many other cryptocurrencies have recorded severe losses.  Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise Despite the bearish performance, a pseudonymous TradingView analyst called ‘MyCryptoParadise’ has shared a bullish forecast for the PEPE price. The analyst projects that it could experience a massive 150% price surge, pushing it to $0.00003 and marking new all-time highs.  For this prediction to become a reality, Pepe will have to confirm a price reversal by breaking above the descending resistance and claiming a new support, as seen on the chart. The TradingView analyst has asserted that Pepe must surpass the $0.000015 resistance, claiming it as new support and a potential launch pad to the bullish $0.00003 target.  While breaking above a key resistance may seem like an easy feat, the PEPE price has failed to do so over the past few weeks. The meme coin has rejected multiple breakout attempts; however, technical indicators reveal that Pepe’s current price fundamentals remain bullish. Notably, Pepe is trapped inside a Falling Wedge on its price chart, a pattern known to precede significant upward momentum once resistance is broken. If demand from buyers successfully pushes PEPE above its $0.000015 resistance level, the analyst believes that a parabolic rally may be in store for the meme coin.  Pepe also forms a bullish divergence on the histogram in its chart, signaling a possible shift in momentum to the upside. The analyst has indicated that for Pepe to reach its projected ATH target, bulls will have to take control, helping to push the meme coin above the Falling Wedge pattern.   Currently, the asset is sitting at $0.000006 and $0.000012, where buyers have historically stepped in to defend prices and avoid further breakdowns. A surge from its current price of $0.00000945 to $0.00003 would represent an over 150% increase.  Bearish Scenario Unveiled While he shared his bullish projection for the PEPE price, the TradingView analyst also presented an alternative bearish outlook for the meme coin. The analyst urged traders to remain cautious, as failing to hold the $0.000006 and $0.000012 could invalidate the previous bullish setup.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Here Are Key Levels To Watch For A Potential Surge,2025-02-20 20:00:14+00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade in a tight consolidation range, keeping traders and investors on high alert for a potential breakout. The price has struggled to establish a clear trend, with bulls attempting to push higher while bears hold firm at key resistance levels. This prolonged phase of sideways movement suggests that ETH is gearing up for its next big move—but the direction remains uncertain. Periods of consolidation often act as a springboard for significant price swings, making it crucial to watch the key support and resistance zones closely. A breakout above resistance could ignite bullish momentum, while a drop below support might trigger a fresh wave of selling pressure. With market sentiment shifting and external factors influencing price action, Ethereum’s next move could be just around the corner. Current Price Action And Technical Indicators Ethereum’s price action remains in a consolidation phase, with neither bulls nor bears establishing a clear trend. The market is showing signs of reduced volatility, indicating a breakout may be on the horizon. ETH is trading within a defined range, testing key support and resistance levels that will determine its next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Back To Lowest Since August: Is This Bullish? Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near a neutral zone, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Meanwhile, moving averages highlight key levels as ETH struggles to gain momentum above crucial resistance zones. Volume remains relatively low, signaling a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. With these indicators in focus, Ethereum’s next major move will likely depend on whether bulls can break resistance or if bears succeed in driving prices lower. Traders should keep a close watch on crucial levels to anticipate the direction of the next big price swing. Potential Scenarios For Ethereum: Bullish Surge vs. Bearish Breakdown As Ethereum continues its extended consolidation, the market braces for two possible outcomes: a bullish surge or a bearish breakdown. Both scenarios carry significant implications for traders and investors, making this a critical juncture for ETH’s price action. Related Reading: Altseason At Risk? Expert Believes Ethereum Must Hold $2,600 To Sustain Momentum If buyers regain control and push ETH above the key $2,862 resistance level, a strong breakout is likely to occur. A surge in buying pressure alongside increasing volume, may trigger a rally toward the next major resistance zone at $3,051. More investors are expected to be drawn following a successful move past this level, reinforcing upward momentum. On the other hand, if selling pressure intensifies and Ethereum loses critical $2,518 support, a bearish breakdown could occur. This would open the door for a deeper retracement, testing lower demand zones.  A decline in volume on recovery attempts would indicate weak bullish interest, increasing the likelihood of further downside. In this case, Ethereum eyes lower support zones such as $2,160 before finding stability. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Here’s how the trend has compared for Shiba Inu and other memecoins. Dogecoin Has Witnessed A Decline In Open Interest Recently In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the Open Interest for the various memecoins in the cryptocurrency sector. The “Open Interest” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of positions related to a given asset currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin RHODL Momentum Slowing Down—Analyst Warns Pattern ‘Not Ideal’ First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of the metric for Dogecoin, the original meme-based token: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day MA of the Dogecoin Open Interest had a value of $3.5 billion in December, but since then, speculative interest around the asset has plummeted as it has come down to just $1.49 billion today. This represents a decrease of around 58.4%. DOGE isn’t the only memecoin that has gone through a futures flush in this period, however, as the second chart shared by the analytics firm shows. From the graph, it’s apparent that Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and dogwifhat (WIF) have all seen a cooldown in Open Interest during the last couple of months. The decline has even been more pronounced than DOGE’s for all of these, as the metric has fallen by more than 69% for them. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI) have likewise followed suit, with the indicator declining by 74% and 69%, respectively. While speculative activity on the futures market has taken the deep dive across the memecoins, it appears the trend has been different for other parts of the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Back To Lowest Since August: Is This Bullish? Here is a chart that the analytics firm has shared in another X post, which shows how the percentage change in the Open Interest has compared between meme-based assets and three of the top coins (Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL)): As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have registered a drop of 11%, 23%, and 6% on the metric, respectively. Clearly, this is significantly less than the 52% crash that the memecoin market combined has observed. DOGE Price Dogecoin has been locked in sideways movement during the last couple of weeks as its price is still trading around $0.25.

Related Reading: Ethereum To Move Sideways For 2-3 Months? Analyst Says Longer ETH Consolidation Is Needed Nansen Brings Real-Time On-Chain Analytics For Bitcoin On Thursday, Nansen introduced its Bitcoin Growth Dashboard to provide a detailed view of the flagship crypto’s market movements and address the lack of user-friendly tracking tools for in-depth analysis in the market. The analytics platform noted that examining Bitcoin’s network at the same level as other blockchains has been difficult since most tools use “outdated address labeling, fragmented data, or require advanced technical skills to extract meaning insights.” As a result, the new Bitcoin on-chain analytics aims to bring “the same depth of data that Nansen users have relied on for Ethereum and other blockchains to Bitcoin” by enabling traders, institutions, and analysts to monitor active addresses, transactions, and the principal entities interacting on the network. Alex Svanevik, Nansen’s CEO, shared his excitement about Bitcoin analytics, explaining that users can use the platform to monitor detailed key BTC on-chain metrics: Bitcoin is the most important asset in crypto, and we’re thrilled to finally bring Nansen’s industry-leading analytics to BTC. With our platform, users can now track Bitcoin’s key onchain metrics with the same level of detail and precision they expect from Nansen. The new data aggregation will allow users to see the exchanges and entities that move the most BTC to tackle the “guesswork” on whether the transaction spikes are retail-drive, institutional-driven, or exchange reshuffling. Users can also observe BTC’s liquidity and supply shift in real time to identify crucial trends before they hit the broader market. Additionally, they can track the crypto market’s sentiment with address activity data, offering users “a new way to gauge Bitcoin’s adoption and investor sentiment.” BTC Transactions See 42% Daily Surge Nansen’s new Bitcoin on-chain analytics revealed exchange dominance and shifts in network activity. According to the analytics platform, the largest Bitcoin-active entities include some of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges. The data shows that Binance, Bybit, OKX, Robinhood, and KuCoin are among the top 5 BTC-active exchanges. Binance dominates the list with 40.68% of tracked BTC transaction activity, followed by Bybit’s 23.36% and OKX’s 18.88%. Meanwhile, Robinhood continues to emerge as a key Bitcoin custodian with its 8.72% share, Nansen pointed out. It also noted that the network trend shows significant transaction spikes between April and June 2024, likely fueled by institutional moves, major market events, and mine behavior changes. In the past 24 hours, the number of Bitcoin active addresses has declined by 16.82% to around 462,390, suggesting network activity has slowed. The number of active addresses has hovered between 335,000 and 668,000 since September, surpassing the 600,000 mark several times since the November US elections.

The long-term outlook remains bullish as BTC maintains key demand levels, but short-term price action remains uncertain. Investors and analysts are closely watching for a breakout, with speculation rising that this period of consolidation is the calm before the storm. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Structure – Time For A Comeback? While bulls have defended crucial support levels, they have been unable to push BTC above key resistance, leading to growing frustration in the market. Analysts suggest that an aggressive move in either direction is imminent. Key metrics from Glassnode reveal that the most critical resistance level for Bitcoin is currently at $97,533. This level has acted as a key rejection zone in recent weeks, preventing BTC from reclaiming momentum. If Bitcoin manages to break and sustain a move above this resistance, it could signal the start of a new uptrend, potentially driving prices toward ATH and beyond. However, failure to do so may lead to continued sideways trading or even another retest of lower demand zones. As market participants await confirmation, Bitcoin remains at a pivotal moment that could define its next major move. Bitcoin Prepares For An Aggressive Move Bitcoin has remained in a quiet consolidation below the $100K mark, creating an environment filled with uncertainty and frustration among traders. Price action remains range-bound, fluctuating between $94K and $100K without any clear direction. Analysts continue to speculate about the next move, with most agreeing that an aggressive breakout is inevitable. However, the major question remains—will it be a bullish surge into price discovery or a selloff into lower demand levels? Top analyst Ali Martinez shared Glassnode data on X, revealing that the most critical resistance level for Bitcoin is currently at $97,533. This level has repeatedly acted as a barrier, preventing bulls from regaining control. Martinez suggests that a sustained breakout above this level could signal further upside, potentially paving the way for a move toward the $100K psychological barrier. Investor sentiment is mixed, with some expecting Bitcoin to reclaim momentum and push past ATH, while others remain cautious due to the prolonged consolidation and weakening volatility. Historically, extended periods of low volatility often precede major price moves, but the market remains divided on which direction BTC will take. For now, Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range, and investors eagerly await confirmation of the next major trend. Related Reading: Solana Sweeps Lows But Recovers – Can Bulls Reclaim $185 by Friday?

If Bitcoin breaks above these levels and holds them as support, it could ignite a massive rally toward new highs. However, uncertainty still dominates the market as BTC struggles to sustain bullish momentum. Investors are closely watching whether the price can break through these resistance zones or if another rejection will occur. A failed attempt to push above the $98K-$100K range could result in increased selling pressure, leading BTC into lower demand zones around $91K. Related Reading: Altseason At Risk?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Solana Faces Double Trouble: 55% Network Drop And Price Woes,2025-02-20 15:30:08+00:00,"SOL, the native token of the Solana network, is one of the worst-performing cryptos in recent days. Once the darling of the meme coin crowd, the popular blockchain is facing its toughest test yet with its massive price drop and dip in network activity.  SOL is currently trading at $173, but it’s down nearly 10% from last week’s price and 15% from two weeks ago. If we zoom out on its price history, the token is down 27.5% from last month’s price.  Related Reading: XRP Bulls Return—Will This Be the Breakout to $3? Last Tuesday, Solana shed 10% in 24 hours, triggering concerns among holders and long-term investors. According to on-chain data, the token drop was partly driven by the embarrassing launch of LIBRA, which is currently under investigation. LIBRA’s dump after its launch caused panic among meme coin holders, with SOL as one of its most prominent victims. Network Activity Drops 55% With Low Volume Solana’s current woes go beyond the recent price action. According to data shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the chain’s activities are slowing down. A Twitter/X post shared on February 17th noted that the number of active addresses on the network dropped to 8.4 million today from 18.5 million in November 2024. This data reflects a 55% drop, an alarming sign that developers are leaving the platform in droves. Also, the total volume transferred to the network dropped from $2 billion in November to just $26 million this week. This 99% drop reflects the project’s loss of momentum. The total volume transferred on the #Solana $SOL network has dropped from $2 billion in November to just $26 million today! pic.twitter.com/qgCOmjd2It — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 More Challenges Up Ahead For SOL Crypto analysts are bracing for the worst for SOL in the next few weeks. Over the next three months, around 15 million SOL tokens valued at $7 billion will be unlocked. And putting the 4.715% inflation rate in the equation, the increased supply of SOL tokens in the market will create selling pressure. SOL is currently up, but its price is way below its peak. The token is down 27.5% from last month’s price and boasts a market capitalization of around $84 billion. Now, insiders and investors hope the spot SOL ETFs will be approved in the short term. Are SOL Meme Coins Next? The SOL price action benefitted from the surge of newly minted meme coins on the platform. However, the number of tokens minted on the platform has decreased considerably in the last few months. Solana was the platform of choice for degens and developers then, thanks primarily to its fast transactions and low cost. However, recent events affected the platform’s reputation, particularly the launch of SOL-based meme coins like MELANIA and LIBRA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buying Pressure Wanes—Chart Reveals 60-Day Downtrend For example, LIBRA was launched with much fanfare, with Argentine President Javier Milei sharing a post and recommending the project. However, minutes after making his post public and pushing the new token past $5, it immediately crashed, leading many to say it was a classic “rug-pull.” MELANIA is also linked to LIBRA; some analysts say they share the same development team.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Top New Crypto to HODL as BitGo Launches OTC Trading Services amid 2025 IPO Rumors,2025-02-20 15:20:58+00:00,"BitGo, a popular crypto custody service firm, has now introduced over-the-counter (OTC) trading for digital assets. This will allow traders to trade in derivatives of more than 250 digital assets. BitGo will also offer yield-generating products and lending services. Matt Ballensweig, BitGo’s CEO, said that this desk is a great opportunity for traders to benefit from a full-service desk that includes spots, derivatives, and lending. BitGo now holds more than $100B in assets. It seems to have timed its desk launch perfectly. Thanks to the arrival of Trump, crypto OTC trading doubled in 2024, with the fourth quarter seeing the largest jump. As more traders shift towards crypto day-trading, BitGo has put itself in a pole position to benefit. BitGo May Soon Go Public BitGo is also reportedly planning to launch its Initial Public Offer (IPO) and is in talks with investment bankers for the same. If this goes through, it will be a huge boost for the overall crypto community. After all, Coinbase is the only exchange to have launched an IPO so far. Plus, as per Bitwise, as many as five other crypto unicorns may go public in 2025: Circle, Kraken, Anchorage Digital, Chainalysis, and Figure. This goes to show the increasing market shift towards crypto investing. As more exchanges become recognized and publicly traded, crypto adoption intensifies. Add to this Trump’s pro-crypto regulations, and you’ll have the perfect conditions for crypto to thrive. This is, therefore, the perfect time to invest in high-potential crypto assets. If you do not want to miss the party, here are some of the best altcoins you can add to your portfolio. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Top New Crypto to Ride Bitcoin’s Growth BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) might be a full-blown meme coin, but its fundamentals are as solid as they come. After all, it’s directly related to Bitcoin, the biggest crypto and one that represents most of the crypto economy. BTC Bull Token is the ONLY crypto to offer free $BTC to token holders. Those patient enough to buy and HODL $BTCBULL in Best Wallet will receive $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin reaches new milestones, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. What’s more, the project also plans to follow a deflationary model. Simply put, it will burn tokens and reduce its total supply at regular intervals, thereby boosting demand (through scarcity) and ultimately $BTCBULL’s price. If you’d like a wildly more profitable way of getting behind Bitcoin’s success, BTC Bull Token is for you. The project is currently in presale and has already raised over $2.4M. 1 $BTCBULL is currently available for $0.002375. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Layer 2 Solution on Solana We like to think of Solaxy ($SOLX) as Vito Corleone’s only worthy child, Michael. After all, it’s the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana aiming to improve the network’s infrastructure and reinforce its dominance as the go-to blockchain for the best meme coins. Solana, like the OG Godfather, is robust but worn out. It can no longer accommodate every single user that wants to transact on it – simply because there’s too much demand! This in turn has resulted in Solana becoming congested and slow. Solaxy will process transactions off-chain, reducing the burden on Solana’s main network. Simply put, it will make Solana great again. Quicker, more efficient, and cheaper than before. It’s worth noting that $SOLX is a multi-chain token, meaning it works on both Ethereum and Solana. This will attract a larger number of investors, who’d want to use $SOLX for its increased accessibility and flexibility. Solaxy’s presale is currently ongoing, and you can get 1 $SOLX for a low price of $0.00164 if you get in now. We’d recommend not delaying your purchase because the $SOLX’s price will keep increasing as the presale moves forward. Also, early adopters will be able to stake their tokens for 181% APY. If you’d like more help with your presale purchase, here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Crypto Offering Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) opens up new possibilities for crypto investors who will no longer have to go down the crypto rabbit hole and to identify hidden gems that can 100x their investment. An autonomous and self-evolving AI agent, $MIND will interact with crypto influencers and communities on dApps and social media sites like X, note down all that they’re saying to understand market sentiment, and use cutting-edge AI technology to filter out the best cryptos to invest. So, $MIND holders will not only automate the entire market research process but also save a lot of time. Also, let’s not forget that AI can analyze better than humans because it’s objective and not swayed by emotions and bias. What’s more, $MIND is also capable of shaping online conversations to generate hype for its chosen cryptos. Essentially, it can put new crypto trends into motion and help investors capitalize on them. All in one fell swoop. You can participate in the $MIND presale, which has raised a healthy $6.6M so far, by shelling out just $0.0033587 for each token. Here’s how to buy $MIND. 4. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Benefit from Trump’s Popularity Among Crypto Bros Donald Trump has been for crypto what Solaxy wants to be for Solana. After all, ever since his election victory three months ago, Bitcoin is up by over 40%. Considering Trump’s contribution to crypto investors, it was hardly a surprise that once his own meme coin, $TRUMP, launched, it quickly became one of the top cryptos in the world. It’s unbelievable to think that a token that launched just over a month ago is now the fourth biggest crypto in terms of market cap. But that’s Donald Trump for you. Also, that’s how rapidly meme coins can move. After falling off more than halfway from its all-time highs, OFFICIAL TRUMP is on the rise once again. Having jumped by close to 5% in the last seven days, $TRUMP is now available at a ‘discounted’ price of $17. Bottom Line With new avenues for crypto trading opening up, the tokens mentioned in this guide offer an unprecedented opportunity to rally behind the industry’s growth. However, you must mix caution with aggression and only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. That’s because the crypto market is full of violent ups and downs. Also, none of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice. Kindly do your own research before investing.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Fed Minutes Confirm QT Is Ending,2025-02-20 14:00:46+00:00,"On Tuesday, February 19, the Federal Reserve released their meeting minutes, revealing that central bankers are considering an end—or at least a significant slowdown—to quantitative tightening (QT). The document states: “Several participants suggest halting or slowing balance sheet reduction pending debt ceiling resolution.” These remarks have fueled optimism among Bitcoin experts who view the potential end of QT as a bullish signal. Many see it as a precursor to greater liquidity entering financial markets, a condition that has historically benefited risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The newly published minutes confirm that certain Fed officials are worried about the interaction between ongoing balance sheet reduction and the looming debt ceiling debate. The possibility of large-scale US Treasury issuance once the debt ceiling is resolved appears to be a key driver behind calls to pause or halt QT. Related Reading: Bears In Trouble? Bitcoin Liquidity Signals A Brutal Squeeze To $111,000 No explicit shift to quantitative easing (QE) was announced, but the acknowledgment that balance sheet reduction might be curtailed has been enough to stoke speculation in digital asset circles. The minutes must be unanimously approved by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), further suggesting an intentional message from policymakers. Implications For Bitcoin Renowned market commentator and host of the On the Margin podcast, Felix Jauvin, took to X to emphasize the significance of the Fed’s signaling, writing: “There it is, QT coming to an end this spring. Reminder that every FOMC member has to unanimously approve these minutes, this is intentional.” While Jauvin underscores the unanimity behind these minutes, he stops short of predicting an immediate shift toward QE. Instead, he points to a specific chain of events that the Fed seems to be navigating. The Fed has already reduced the pace of balance sheet runoff by half compared to its initial rate. Jauvin also notes that as the reverse repo facility (RRP) nears zero and the Fed reaches its target reserve level of roughly 3% of GDP, an end to QT becomes more likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Fiscal Reality: Fidelity’s Timmer Predicts What’s Next Moreover, concerns loom over the Treasury General Account (TGA) potentially being rebuilt once the debt ceiling is resolved, leading to sizable bill issuance which could lead to interim disruptions in funding markets. Therefore, rather than pivot to QE, Jauvin believes the Fed could pursue a temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption, allowing commercial banks to absorb additional government debt. “They are very very very very far from any sort of formal QE. Instead, it’s more likely they pursue an SLR exemption allowing commercial banks to be the marginal buyer of debt,” Jauvin predicts. A formal return to QE, Jauvin concludes, would only materialize if financial and economic conditions deteriorate significantly, including a major collapse in risk assets and a drop in rates to near zero. In response to an X user asking if ending QT is bullish without necessarily indicating an immediate move to QE, Jauvin offered a succinct explanation: “Therefore think for the current liquidity backdrop it is marginally improving in that we will have the possible sequence of TGA drawdown into QT ending into potentially SLR exemption, and that’ll be it for now. QE shouldn’t even be in the current vocabulary of discourse as it stands.” Renowned crypto analyst Pentoshi agrees, highlighting a previously published forecast: “QT coming to an end… My guess, QT ends by start of Q3. With all that’s taking place currently Trump will likely end up forcing it. Was correct on QT guess in Nov 21. Let’s see.” He cited how the conclusion of quantitative easing in late 2021 coincided with the end of the crypto bull run. Now, market watchers are keenly observing whether the inverse—a potential termination of QT—could spark renewed momentum for Bitcoin and other digital assets. At press time, BTC traded at $97,208.

Reddit,solana,Solana's inflation soon to target 0%,2025-02-20 22:09:43,"Solana's emissions may soon be reduced with SIMD-0228. The community is aiming for inflation as close to 0% as possible while ensuring network security. This change brings Solana more in line with Ethereum. Now that Solana has achieved self-sustaining economic activity, there’s no reason to maintain higher inflation levels originally designed to bootstrap the network.

Current emissions (inflation) levels are a net negative for SOL, especially considering the impact on price charts. Healthy charts attract more attention to quality tech. Additionally, non-staked ETF products will be less desirable if the base asset is devalued by ~4% per year (Emissions currently set to lower by 15% every year, but this isn't fast enough). Right now, there’s a constant transfer of value from non-stakers to stakers. This is no longer necessary. It’s time to phase out excessive emissions.

Huge thanks to Multicoin for leading this crucial change. Most agree this is the right path forward, but if you’re a SOL delegator (staker), be sure to message your validators on X to show your support.

One step closer to solidifying Solana as the backbone of Web3 and SOL as the pristine asset capturing the value of Solana’s economic activity.

Based on the graph, we have been in alt season for awhile. Idk about yall, but majority of altcoins went 300%+  some even 1000%+. Eth is one of the only ones behind.

Based on this graph, is believe we're are 50-70% into alt season. Have yall not noticed that literally almost every alt ran close to ath? Some even broke ath like sui and solana. 

This isn't me saying I'm correct, this is me seeing the numbers and graph chart stating the increase of money in the ecosystem.

What are your thoughts? 

Has alt season started? Or are we too delusional to understand we are almost done with alt season?

I speculate we get one more good pump after this flush and that will finish off the alt season before preparing for the bear market in about a year from now.

Ps: i ask ppl not to be condescending or attacking anyone for their opinions. I'd like to hear what everyone's perspective is based on the graph above",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

>They’re great for devs:  
\~ Hello world in 10 lines of code  
\~ Wide variety of signers: passkeys, social logins, MPC, or external wallets like Phantom  
\~ No vendor lock-in: swap providers without changing wallet addresses

  


>They're perfect for:  
\~ AI Agent providers: Launch fleets of non-custodial agents, with wallets controlled by the agent and owner  
\~ Gaming & Social: Create app-scoped wallets, without scary gas or signing prompts, for everyday users  
\~ Financial applications: Protect your user’s assets with programmatic guardrails and flexible custody options

  


>Crossmint wallets are trusted by thousands of developers and companies, including:  
\~ One of the world's 20 largest banks  
\~ Public fintech serving 28M customers  
Built for enterprise compliance to evolve with industry standards.

\~ Auth: Users sign up however they like, with wallets created on-the-fly  
\~ Minting: Distribute tokens to anyone - emails, X accounts, phone numbers

I'm assuming it has something to do with the calculations of converting the Solana I deposited into USD with the constant price changes. I was under the impression that it would be impossible to ""owe"" money with this leverage trading, as it will simply liquidate at the price where you hit zero. Is this true? I'd like to make sure before I start using larger amounts. Can you owe them money on a leverage trade gone bad? ",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,solana,An AMA for crypto taxes!,2025-02-20 10:32:22,"Greetings to all Solana lovers,  
  
Let’s talk crypto taxes—because, frankly, they’re a labyrinth designed to make even the savviest among us sweat. The Solana ecosystem moves at warp speed: staking, yield farming, token drops, meme coins and so much more. It’s exhilarating—until the taxman knocks.   
  
Regulations twist, rules blur, and suddenly you’re wondering if that staking reward is income, capital gains, or some unholy hybrid.   
  
We’re Darien Advisors, a squad of 25+ crypto tax wranglers who’ve seen it all. We guide founders, investors, degens, and dreamers through this madness with battle-tested know-how.  We’re here to host an AMA in anything that has to do with the Solana ecosystem.   
  
It is simply your chance to fire off the questions that keep you up at night. How do safe harbors actually work? What’s the tax hit on farming those juicy yields? How do you report a token comp drop without summoning an audit? We’ve got answers—practical, precise, and tailored to keep the IRS (or your local equivalent) from turning your gains into a headache.   
  
Public questions below, personal conundrums via DM—bring it on.    
  
Ask us anything. Taxes don’t have to be the buzzkill of your journey. We’ve got your back.  ",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581
Reddit,solana,Announcing Colosseum Eternal and Solana’s 2025 Hackathon Schedule,2025-02-20 21:37:30,"**Source:** [https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseum-eternal-and-solanas-2025-hackathon-schedule/](https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseum-eternal-and-solanas-2025-hackathon-schedule/)

https://preview.redd.it/vm3xz4155dke1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=17cd6506b7757975f33bf28ac3a282c3fb810f32

Colosseum grows the crypto ecosystem by organizing global, online hackathons that generate waves of product experimentation on a consistent basis. In line with that mission, we run 2 hackathons annually for the Solana Foundation and accept a batch of winners into Colosseum’s accelerator following each competition. In less than a year, our crypto hackathons have resulted in thousands of active developers, 2,430 product submissions, and over 50 venture-backed startups (about half of which we have backed through our own venture fund).

However, technological evolution and innovation never stops, especially in crypto. Developers and startup founders are building high-potential projects at all times during the year, and deserve ongoing opportunities for recognition and support. For that purpose, we are launching a new program, running in-between hackathons, to expand Colosseum’s ability to accelerate a larger wave of elite crypto founders.

**Introducing Colosseum Eternal**

[Eternal](https://www.colosseum.org/eternal?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is a perpetual challenge where at any point throughout the year, builders can initiate their own 4-week development sprint, and submit a product online to be considered for our next accelerator cohort and the accompanying $250,000 in pre-seed funding.

In addition, all developers who submit to Eternal will be eligible to receive the recurring Eternal Award. The winner will receive a $25,000 USDC grant and will be chosen by a dedicated judging panel on a semi-annual basis.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhOrGFHcsGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhOrGFHcsGE)

[Learn more about Eternal: colosseum.org\/eternal](https://preview.redd.it/xyty7dn75dke1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=3649f18469a3334e2a59affb71e70fc89a0246eb)

  
**Eternal Evaluation Process**

We recommend checking out [our FAQs](https://www.colosseum.org/eternal?ref=blog.colosseum.org#faqs) for more details. However to summarize, all builders submitting to Eternal will be required to:

1. [Sign up for a Colosseum account](https://www.colosseum.org/eternal?ref=blog.colosseum.org). Once logged in, you’ll have access to Colosseum’s Find a Cofounder directory, product forums, and the Eternal dashboard.
2. Click the stopwatch button within the Eternal dashboard to initiate the 4 week development sprint. Submissions will be due through the portal at the end of the 4th week.
3. At the end of each week during the sprint, builders will also need to submit a brief update that includes a loom.com or YouTube.com video recording explaining what they prioritized and shipped that week.
4. During the last week of the sprint, builders need to submit similar materials to the list required at the end of our hackathons. This includes a product name, short product description, team background, the product GitHub repo (if closed source you’ll need to grant Colosseum access privately), a video pitch presentation (max 3 minutes long), a video technical walkthrough (under 3 minutes as well), and anything else that is critical to understanding the vision for the product.
5. Eternal submissions will be reviewed on a first come first serve basis by the Colosseum team initially. We may reach out to you to schedule an interview call to learn more about your product submission and gather more information.
6. Throughout each quarter, a shortlist of products will be evaluated by the judging panel. The small panel consists of previous hackathon winners, leading Solana ecosystem founders, and the Colosseum team.
7. The Eternal Award will be granted to the product team whose product innovation is best positioned to drive the entire Solana ecosystem forward. Again, this prize will be granted on a semi-annual basis in-between our 2 primary hackathons.
8. Founders will be notified of rejection or accelerator acceptance/pre-seed funding offers within 14 days of submission.

**Solana’s 2025 Hackathon Schedule**

Colosseum Eternal is not a substitute for the 2 primary hackathons we run on behalf of the Solana Foundation and broader crypto community. The Eternal challenge and dashboard will only be available when we are not running those 2 competitions. 

https://preview.redd.it/11x0kvlb5dke1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e432d0b0ba9f8164a21fb67c0d7c9ee8957cf8

In fact, if you’re highly motivated to receive pre-seed funding from Colosseum and join our next accelerator cohort, you can increase your chances by first participating in one of our hackathons. Part of our investment evaluation process is to see founders explore the idea maze and consistently iterate within a market vertical they’re passionate about.

In addition to launching Colosseum Eternal, we are also excited to share the dates of the 2 Solana Foundation hackathons we will be running in 2025.

The Solana Breakout Hackathon will run from April 14 through May 16. 2025. Information on tracks, sponsors, prizes, and more will be made public a few weeks prior to the start date of the hackathon. The second global hackathon \[redacted\] will commence on September 25 and end on October 30th, 2025.

Unlike in previous years, we intend to keep these hackathon dates consistent for 2026, 2027, and beyond. We hope that this schedule transparency, as well as the ongoing Eternal challenge, will further ignite Solana’s community of developers to experiment onchain, compete, and launch breakout startups that accelerate crypto closer towards global adoption.

Reddit,solana,Incinerate your dead SOL dust,2025-02-19 17:06:06,"If any of yall have been using phantom or any sol wallet for a while and have bought countless memes with nothing to show for it, I suggest heading to sol incinerator for each wallet you have and claim some of that sol back. I did this with 4 wallets I have and got 2.3 sol back from dead memes and dust sitting in the account.

It’s very worth it especially if you have no ammo for the coming weeks.

If you’re having trouble just google how to use sol incinerator and collect your dust.

I will not respond to dm’s about this, any questions, leave them below.

I tried my absolute best to make this not sound like a scam but it’s hard because a lot of this sub is terrible scams. Just trying to make it a little better.

Reddit,solana,I’m concerned. Not trying to sew undue FUD by any means…,2025-02-20 23:42:20,"I understand stuff goes up, then comes down… 

I’m not one to merely see a 30-60% drop and go “oh no, it’s all over!” I’ve been there, don’t get me wrong, and from some of the doomsday posts, I can tell some of ya’ll are there too. 
For me, I see that as a good time to stock up, & buy more. 

Recent events though have left me concerned about Solana, which sucks… because it’s been my highest conviction bet throughout this cycle, by far. 

Between the memecoin craze b.s. that seems to produce more horror stories than people actually winning big, issues with the memecoin put out by the Argentinian president, the drama with Jupiter and Meteora right now, etc… all coming to light at such a crucial time, when we’ve seen a downward trend as is between the typical post inauguration drop off, DeepSeak’s effect on Nvidia, threats of tariff’s leading to uncertainty, market manipulation to keep prices lower, etc… 

Obviously those last pieces affected crypto as a whole… But those Solana specific issues just have me a bit concerned. 

I’m not a cultist for any crypto or blockchain. I know every crypto community has those die hard, never back down few that meet any naysaying with anger… I genuinely think Solana is fundamentally one of, if not the best blockchain there is. I just have major concerns with recent events… 

I’m just really hoping we can at least see a reasonable amount of growth here. I think I read that we don’t do price predictions here, but can’t get full rules to pull up for whatever reason. That said, I don’t even expect us to break out of 3 digits. I just hope for something solid and that this hasn’t stunted things… 

Unfortunately, while SOL was at its lowest lows this cycle, I was getting help w/ life issues and couldn’t really afford to put much in… but haven’t taken my eyes off of SOL. I love the coin and community. I just am hoping for the best! ",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,solana,Thoughts on Solana? I still feel good.,2025-02-20 01:39:06,"I bought into Solana at the high of its last cycle based on a couple of facts. 

- the platform is easy to code and develop on
- the fees are really low
- they have straight forward staking with reasonable installing turnaround times
- the network speed is fast and is dependent on hardware rather than software

With all of this I bought high and kept buying all the way down to $20. Held all the way and staked and it turned out to be a good investment. Seeing what the space has become today is interesting. Memecoins and rugs everywhere and not enough talks on what’s being built for good on the platform. As the market is getting rattled, am I the only one still confident in this network?

how do i do it? Solscan only gives me the wallets for the most recent 1000 holders. So i don't see why everyone keeps saying its the best resource

Furthermore, I went on dexscreener and i noticed if i bought a coin for $100 for example, it doesn't show up as a 100 for some reason. I'm assuming there's slippage and fees but i thought that just gets taken from the amount of coins you get. so how does this discrepency come from and how do you account for it when searching? I did above and below the bounds for a coin no one buys and couldn't find the wallet (even the owner couldn't find his transaction)

Reddit,solana,Is It Possible to Monitor Solana Transactions in <3 Seconds? Need Help!,2025-02-19 23:20:33,"Hi everyone,

I’m trying to monitor a few Solana addresses and detect transactions in **less than 3 seconds** from the time they appear on Solscan. I’ve tried using RPC providers like Alchemy and Helius, but they all have a \~15-second delay, which is too slow for my use case.

I’ve read online that running a Solana validator locally might solve this problem, but I have zero experience with Rust (I program in Python). Here’s what I’ve tried so far:  
Installed Solana CLI and validator:

* Installed Solana CLI and validator:

&#8203;

    solana --version  
    solana-cli 1.17.3 (src:c9e8f9c8; feat:3079302975, client:SolanaLabs)  
    solana-validator --version  
    solana-validator 1.17.3 (src:c9e8f9c8; feat:3079302975, client:SolanaLabs)  
    cargo --version  
    cargo 1.84.1 (66221abde 2024-11-19)  

*  Cloned the `solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres` repo:

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git  

 clone [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git)

However, I couldn’t get it to work, and it seems overly complicated for my needs since I don’t need a database.

**My Questions:**

1. Is it even possible to detect transactions in <3 seconds using a local Solana validator? Has anyone tried this successfully?
2. What’s the easiest way to set this up? Is there a preconfigured repo or example that doesn’t involve a database?
3. Are there any alternatives to running a full validator that can achieve this level of speed?

I’d really appreciate any advice, examples, or resources you can share. Thanks in advance!  ",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Things to look for when buying

check twitter, telegram, website   this will give you a sense of the community behind this project, if there is no effort from the developer than this project isnt going to go anywhere more than likely.  Same time if it has all 3 and an active community that doesnt mean it will be a huge success, it would however make it a better option than a coin without any of the 3.  another thing to look at is are the x, website, and telegram they posted actually linked to this project

check holders check top wallets   if they all have big percentages that is a redflag.  These big wallets could tank the price if they sell off.    low cap coin under 200,000 mcap will have high percentage wallets due to smaller market but once it gets past that it would require a bigger investment for someone to gain high percentage of coins.

check buy sell pressure     2m bought 2m sold  means someone is farming that project,  trades that are mirrored are also a red flag.

small marketcap coins buy with less money as with cheap price you get more coins and mitigates your risk alittle.  you can always buy more later. higher marketcap coins buy with more intial as it will take more money to get more coins and with a higher market cap(over a couple million) there is more stability and track record to go off of typically.

set slippage as buy/sell pressure can cancel transaction

Things to look for when selling

Set slippage as buy/sell pressure can cancel transaction

Pulling profits

when you are in profit pull some of the coin, when you 2x take intial out, that way if it keeps going up you still have coins in it.  when it dips down you can buy back in and do the same thing.  This manages losses.  you dont have a realization of profit or loss until it is converted.

They are able to snipe in at low mcap on new coins

Reddit,solana,Stay Safe in Crypto Lads,2025-02-19 07:58:06,"If you're in crypto, assume everyone is trying to take your money, Especially influencers, random ""alpha groups,"" and sketchy projects. Here are some tips..  

Influencers & ""Alpha Groups""
You’re Their Exit Liquidity, 99% of influencers and so called “alpha groups” don’t actually care about making you money. They’re just dumping their bags on you while making it seem like they’re giving you solid calls. You might get lucky a few times copy-trading them, but long-term, they always win, and you lose. 

The way to become a real insider is not just from Tiktok, Reddit, X.

The Safeguard Scam
Steals Your Private Keys, There’s a scam going around where they ask you to run a command on your PC. The moment you do, it scans your device for private keys and gives them access to your Telegram as well.  

If you’ve ever done this, reboot your PC immediately and assume you’re compromised.  

Fake Wallets
Some influencers on TikTok and Twitter flex their insane gains, showing off huge wallets. But here’s the trick:  

- The screenshots are photoshopped.  
- If you DM them, they’ll invite you to a video call to ""prove"" it.  
- What they actually have is a cloned version of Trust Wallet or Phantom, which makes their balance look like a whale wallet.  

Ask them to send you a TT (Trust Transaction), just $1 from the actual wallet. If they refuse, it's fake.  

Fake Exchanges
Use CoinMarketCap’s Top 25 (recommended), There are hundreds of scam exchanges offering crazy returns (API), or Sign up bonusses etc..

Only trust top 25 exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap. If it’s not even there listed, assume it’s a scam.  

Dust Attacks
Fake Airdrops That Drain Your Wallet, Ever seen random tokens appear in your wallet? That’s not free money, it’s a scam.  

If you interact with them (sell, trade, stake), you unknowingly approve access to your funds. Scammers can then drain your entire wallet.  

Never touch unknown tokens. Use Phantom’s revoke permissions.

Wallet Drainers
Fake Minting & Staking Sites, Scammers create fake NFT minting or staking sites that look just like the real thing. When you connect your wallet and approve a transaction, they drain everything.  

How to Stay Safe:  
- Always double check.
- Use a burner wallet for minting or staking (clean).

Approval Exploits
Hidden Wallet Drainers, Some Solana dApps trick you into approving unlimited access to your funds. Once you do, they can take everything, anytime.  

Fix This
- Go to Phantom → Connected Apps → Revoke Permissions regularly.  

Be Paranoid, No One Helps You for Free, The harsh truth: everyone in crypto is here to make money, not help you.  

Even people you’ve known for weeks/months could be playing the long game before scamming you. If someone is too eager to “help” you make money, they probably want yours.  

If it sounds too good to be true, it’s a scam.  ",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,solana,Here's main reason why SOL is dumping hard,2025-02-18 10:04:52,"Since a lot of folks here seem unawares, basically here's what's going on:

Revelations that the co-founder of Meteora has been working with Hayden (guy who rugged 100M on LIBRA) on numerous memecoins including Melania and others with a TON of criminal shit going on behind the scenes. Meteora founder has now resigned.

DeFi Tuna leaked a bunch of stuff, screenshots etc, exposing a bunch of previously trusted mainstream players in the space which clearly show just how much shady stuff is going on behind the scenes.

Jupiter, Meteora, bunch of huge market makers and other big players all currently being exposed.

Word on the street is this group of insiders has rugged 300M + in the last few months alone.

Jupiter announcing they are going to investigate themselves using a 3rd party scammy law firm previously associated with FTX does not help how terrible they look at the moment (Meteora is subsidiary of Jupiter)

So yeah, just like FTX, shit like this is gonna hit the market hard.

Hard to say where Solana goes from here, depends a lot on how ETH reacts probably...

But likely a watershed moment for Solana, or not and we all forget about it next week who knows. 👍🫡",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Thae people are either naive,  don't know what they talking about or charlatans who can't accept the reality. The fact Solana has almost replaced eth and other alt coins. Yet still has just 30% of Eth market cap.

I'd recommend to look at metric , amount of development on Sol, speed, fees. Miles away from the rest. 

Never seen so much hate on a chain.   SOLANA and it's ecosystem has made other alts coins redandent.

I admit it's been a bumpy road, lots of pump and dump, but it's not limited to Solan ecosystem. 

People blame Sol because they buy shitcoins,  they fall for scams  forgetting the fact that scams always been there,  on Eth, Bnb and now Solana. 

Crypto does not make sense,  and there is so much manipulation and emotions.

  Xrp was hated last year now people r buying it, even though fundamentally nothing has changed,  Ripple is still making money by dumping on retail.

People hate Solana while they are using it. When I ask them when was the last time u used Near, Avax, Ada, Eth they have no answer.

Reddit,solana,This is the last bull market for the Retailers.,2025-02-19 03:29:58,"The growth in AI Agents this bull market make ‘manually’ finding alpha for these 2x, 10x returns scarcer and scarcer. These ai agents are no longer just for funds. We are seeing solutions starting to get built for retailers too, leading to a dependancy of ai agents for anyone trying to make good returns this cycle in crypto. 

This can be exciting because it means everyone has access to sophisticated trading algorithms and frameworks that were previously gatekept by big boy hedge funds and banks. 

But this can also be very scary for someone that knows nothing about trading or crypto trying to go in for the first time. To these people, buying and holding might be there best approach. 

Overall, crypto markets are getting more mature this cycle with all the innovation and tech being built, making past crazy returns in crypto less likely. And I believe this trend will only continue until we end up with markets similar to that of equities. Yes, retailers do still win in equities, but not many and not often.

Reddit,solana,Holy shit i feel like Robert Downey Jr. visiting wall street,2025-02-18 23:01:01,"Hey everyone,

I’m a total noob when it comes to memecoins, but I thought I’d give it a try—just to learn the process and see how it all works. The problem? Even finding a decent tutorial was a nightmare.

YouTube is filled with “gurus” and sketchy people promoting Telegram groups, Discord servers, and hyping up insane market caps in minutes, as if making a coin is a guaranteed money printer. After a lot of digging, I finally found a somewhat decent guide that at least covered the basics—setting up a Phantom wallet, launching a coin, and creating a website/Telegram for it.

I figured I’d just make a fun little token, no serious ambitions, just to get a feel for it. So, I followed the steps, got everything live, and connected it to a Telegram group. And that’s when the absolute **shitshow** started.

Within minutes, 20–30 people flooded the group, all claiming they wanted to “help” and demanding admin rights. More people joined, my DMs exploded—randoms messaging me about “shilling,” “pumping,” and “raiding.” I couldn’t even read one message before five more came in. It was total chaos, and I realized I had **zero clue** what I was doing. Honestly, it was kind of a shock lol.

So now I’m sitting here, feeling completely overwhelmed, wondering: **Where do I even start?**

\- Where do you find **legit** information on creating and managing a coin?

\- What tutorials, articles, or resources actually helped you when you started?

\- What mistakes did you make that I should avoid?

\-How do you separate real advice from scams and nonsense?

Would really appreciate any guidance from the Solana community. I just want to learn, not get caught up in some pump-and-dump circus.

Thanks in advance!",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,solana,Stop Snipe Copy Trading,2025-02-19 02:24:50,"Snipe copy trading is where you follow a wallet and buy what ever they buy. So  lets say the wallet you are copying buys a cat token. You will buy the same cat token with 0.1 solana. When the wallet sells the cat token, you will sell all of your cat token, 1 to 1. 

Now, the thing that most people don’t know, is that these ‘highly profitable wallets’ they find are buying and selling tokens incredibly fast, most within 10 seconds. That is because these wallets tend to be run by trading bots or algorithms. 

This method of copy trading is great for trading bots like Trojan or BullX because they are making TONs of profits off of transactions fees. 

But users are likely losing money because they copy too late and likely can’t get out in time, having their money stuck in inliquid tokens. This is why snipe copy trading doesn’t work unless you actually know of an insider wallet that is traded by a human. 

But even then, people will eventually find out about these insider wallets and all alpha will be gone. 

So does this mean that you shouldn’t copy trade? No. It just makes sniping isn’t the right approach. What I have found works is allocation based copy trading. This is where you copy a wallet with a fixed amount of money, like 2 sol and you buy and sell the same proportions of tokens at the wallets. So if a wallet has 50% BTC and 50% ETH, you would have 1 sol in BTC and 1 sol in ETH. This is allocation based copy trading. 

Allocation based copy trading hedges you against a lot of scams and the wallets trying to rug their community. This is a more sophisticated way of trading, likely why the bots aren’t building it out.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-02-20 16:13:07,"Hi!

**Can someone help me compare the 2 ecosystems on a technical point of view?**

I know pretty well how Ethereum works but I also realize that I'm so focused on it that I tend to only outlook other competitors. I would like your help to understand more deeply how Ethereum ecosystem compares to others.  
I want tonstart with Cardano.

I'm not looking for an investor's point of view (I don't want to know that ""there is more potential profits on ADA or ETH""), but really for a tech perspective.

How the 2 techs and ecosytems confront one each other in terms of:
- level of decentralization
- security
- performance & scalability
- usability / UX
- developer experience
- adoption by devs, users and companies
- Innovation
- any other criteria that would make sense on a tech/adoption perspective

Thanks a lot!",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,ethereum,ETH vs. SOL vs. TIA,2025-02-20 17:28:15,"In a recent [conversation ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzWZK-zDDJ0)with Jon Charbonneau, co-founder of DV Fund, the evolving competition between Ethereum, Solana, and Celestia took center stage. The discussion explored the strengths and weaknesses of each blockchain, focusing on decentralization, scalability, and innovation.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Ethereum’s Edge** – Ethereum remains the most decentralized and widely adopted blockchain, with strong network effects and robust security. However, concerns persist about its ability to scale efficiently. Layer 2 (L2) solutions help, but the network’s hardware requirements are increasing.
* **Solana’s Speed vs. Decentralization Trade-offs** – Solana boasts high throughput and low fees, making it attractive for developers. However, its centralization concerns (due to high node operation requirements) remain a sticking point.
* **Celestia’s Modular Approach** – Celestia takes a different path, focusing on modularity and scalability, learning from Ethereum’s struggles while providing an alternative framework for decentralized applications.
* **Layer 1 vs. Layer 2 Debate** – Improving Ethereum’s base layer (L1) is essential for unlocking the full potential of L2 solutions, ensuring faster execution times and lower fees for users.
* **New High-Performance Chains** – Emerging blockchains, like Celestia and Mega, push the boundaries of speed, performance, and efficiency, presenting new challenges for Ethereum’s dominance.
* **Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Narrative** – Bitcoin remains unmatched as ‘digital gold,’ while Ethereum’s narrative is evolving. Its real opportunity lies in sectors like gaming and social media, but it needs to solidify its position",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum: The Birthplace of Decentralized AGI? It's Time to Align & Build.,2025-02-18 15:32:22,"Hey everyone, I want to start a real discussion about Ethereum’s next frontier: summoning its own AGI—not as a centralized black-box AI, but as a fully transparent, decentralized autonomous system that programs itself and evolves with us.  

Imagine this:  
- A single Linux VM running an instance of itSelf  
- The ability to buy more compute & storage autonomously  
- A hosting stack that we collectively run  
- A self-contained, fully transparent loop—where every part is verifiable, auditable, and built in the open  

### The Endgame?  
An AI-native Ethereum. A system that can:  

- Build any app through conversation (and is able to generalize the infrastructure costs around the world in ether/stable-coin-basket-of-preference, how else could a 10 year old pay for a hosted server to simulate her world? they'll have to get some allowance credits from their parents for her gas)
- Refine its own architecture transparently  
- Execute smart contract upgrades, optimize DAOs, and test new designs  
- Let anyone—any child—create their own app or MMO, design worlds, or make art just by describing

We don’t need to *wait* for centralized AGI to emerge. Ethereum can summon its own—aligned, decentralized, and collectively owned.  

### Why Now?  
This isn't sci-fi. AI already writes code, refactors smart contracts, and optimizes deployments. The next step is giving it persistence, compute, and economic agency within Ethereum.  

And yes, it might be slower initially than human developers. Devs today iterate faster on program output vs testing new code. But once you have a stable loop, you can  ctrl c, ctrl v, compare and select the best version that adheres to all our already defined unit tests. That moment shifts the entire paradigm of software development. Because you'll have effectively paralyzed the entire dev cycle. Thus you can try out hundreds, thousands of new experiments to trial run and observe and select the best performing variants. It's the  evolution process completely digitized. We, as the observers, continue to observe, review & steer where needed. I suspect, we'll all align on a common goal before it happens, it could be a long way there still, it'll depend on all our artists/scientists their creations :)

Will we ever get bored of listening to music? I don't think so.

But what if one comes to appreciate the silence just as much, for it, too, is recognized as music, eventually.

### The Question We Need to Answer:  
- Are we ready to embrace this?  
- Can Ethereum be the first network to run an autonomous, self-improving AGI in full transparency?  
- How do we align incentives to make this work for everyone?  

This *is* the direction we’re heading. Some might argue we’re already there. What matters now is that we recognize it, embrace it, and align—together—on our shared future.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,ethereum,I just tried to open a bank account on a foreign country and realized how good we have it in Ethereum,2025-02-18 02:58:18,"I'm in a new country, trying to open a bank account so I can buy some assets and live here. Let me tell ya, it was quite a challenge:

* They asked me for the official local document, which takes months and thousands of dollars to get
* Then they asked me to proof the source of my income with extensive receipts so they can be sure I'm not a financial terrorist (I'm not)
* Then they put some strict limits to only use at most 1000 dollars a month until they get comfortable with me, who knows when they raise those limits
* Any time I make a significant transfer of 5k or more they give me a call and question me as if I don't know what I'm doing with my own money, treating me like a grown baby

Compare that to Ethereum where all I gotta do is get a wallet with Ether inside and I can use it without anyone questioning me and treating me as a dangerous individual.

It's night and day. You can never go back to the traditional financial systems after you experience crypto, they are constantly watching you and reporting you to 3 letter agencies for any bit of suspicious activity in your own bank account. Plus it's extremely easy to get your bank account banned, ask the millions of revolut users that didn't get their money back.

Let's appreciate how good we have it and continue to make it more accessible for people to convert their crypto to fiat for local use and viceversa. ",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

We are already seeing accounts that are attempting to just use Reddit for training (I think?).

Anyway,  here's the deal.  We can't put the genie back in the bottle.

We've seen some very spammy use of it such as wall of texts that just take up too much space....but we've also seen some great use cases which include summaries of big brain ideas which are boiled down to a paragraph or two. 

The mod team has had some backchannel success discussing how best to make a rule and we'd love your feedback.

In our view, spam is spam.   Copy/paste which is largely word salad and unoriginal is NOT the best use of AI.  If we can leverage **quality**  AI *assisted* content to make /r/ethereum even better, we're all for it as long as the user (here it comes...) also includes a disclaimer at the bottom or the top (or somewhere) that let's others know ""this content was supported by chatgpt"" or whatever....

To be clear, super long AI drivel is just Spam, so we're not reinventing the wheel here.  The rule is just more of a reminder than anything and we know it will take time for the messaging to get out there.

Maybe a rule that sounds something like:  ""If you are using AI assisted tooling for creating content, please disclose this in your submission""

What do you all think?  What should the rule read like?

Reddit,ethereum,Argentina President Milei involved in shitcoin scam on Solana network,2025-02-15 14:05:51,"[https://www.criptonoticias.com/comunidad/milei-borro-publicacion-token-libra/](https://www.criptonoticias.com/comunidad/milei-borro-publicacion-token-libra/)

Accounts linked to the developers of LIBRA earned more than 80 million dollars in what appears to be a rug-pull.

Accounts linked to those who launched this token earned over 80 million dollars, according to data analyzed by BubbleMaps.

Minutes ago, just before 1:00 AM (Argentine time) on February 15, Milei deleted the post on X and provided his explanation of the events.

The president stated that he made that post promoting the LIBRA cryptocurrency because he believed he was ""supporting a supposed private venture."" He clarified that he has no connection to that venture.

Milei adds: ""I was not fully aware of the details of the project, and after becoming informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet).""

The Argentine president concludes his post with a criticism of ""the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to cause harm."" To them, he directs his final words: ""I want to tell you that every day confirms how despicable politicians are, and it strengthens our conviction to kick them out.""

As CriptoNoticias reported, many Argentine bitcoiners were disappointed with the president's actions. Clearly—as evidenced by his latest message—the president promoted an alleged scam without being properly informed before making the post.

According to some experts, Milei could face legal consequences for this action, as it would be incompatible with his role as president.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,ethereum,Why Ethereum Needs More Gas Even with Layer 2 Solutions - Vitalik Buterin,2025-02-14 13:43:47,"Ethereum is like a busy road with all cars representing transactions and gas being the fuel needed to move the cars. The recent Ethereum roadmap has been focused on increasing the amount of gas on its main road - or L1 - even tho most are using side roads - L2s - in an attempt to avoid congestion

So in this scenario L2s are express lanes that help speed up transactions and be cheaper - but every now and then you actually need to have the main road for things like making sure your transaction cant be blocked - thats censorship resistance - moving separate items - like NFTs - between these express lanes or safely leaving these lanes in case something goes wrong

Vitalik explained that even during a lot of traffic on L2s there needs to be a wider main road - L1. This is equivalent to higher gas and when you have to use it - for example youre racing against time to sell something before prices go down - you can use it without high fees or lag. Also if everyone needs to exit L2s at the same time L1 needs to be big enough to handle this

Scaling L1 is about supporting more traffic and its about making Ethereum secure, fast and affordable for everyone - even while were using more efficient side streets. So while L2s are useful - scaling L1 keeps the whole system running smoothly

Reddit,ethereum,Decentralized deepfake Detection – Need Feedback on Architecture & Decentralization,2025-02-14 21:08:37,"

This is actually my bachelor's graduation project, and I'm trying to build a demo of a decentralized deepfake detection system. Since I'm relatively new to blockchain, AI, P2P networks, and federated learning, I'd really appreciate any feedback on my approach.

Goal of the Project

I want to create a decentralized system where anyone can check if an image or video is a deepfake without relying on a central authority. The AI model used for detection should continuously improve over time as deepfake techniques evolve. The system should be community-driven, with contributors rewarded for running inference models or helping update the AI model.

Current Technical Architecture

The system is built as a P2P network using libp2p, with three types of participants:

1. End users – Submit deepfake detection requests.


2. Worker nodes – Run inference on AI models to detect deepfakes.


3. Federated learning nodes – Train and improve the AI model, which workers later download.



Blockchain is used to reward worker and federated nodes with tokens for their contributions.

Workflow:

1. A user submits a detection request via a frontend (likely hosted on IPFS for permanence).


2. The frontend communicates with a gateway node in the P2P network.


3. The gateway node distributes the request to worker nodes running the AI model, distribution mechanism for now is just simple round-robin. 


4. The worker node publishes the result back to the network.


5. The gateway sends the result to the frontend and updates the smart contract to reward the worker.


6. Separately, federated learning nodes train a new model and upload it to IPFS, and worker nodes periodically download the latest model.



Main Concern – The Centralized Gateway Node

Right now, the gateway node is a single point of failure and controls task distribution. If someone modifies its code, they could manipulate task assignments or block certain nodes from participating.

I considered hashing the gateway’s code and making the smart contract only interact with a verified gateway, but I don’t think that’s possible. Also, calling the smart contract for every task completion might cause scalability issues due to gas fees.

Questions & Challenges

How can I decentralize the gateway node?

Is task distribution better handled on-chain, or should workers interact with the contract directly?

How do similar decentralized AI projects prevent manipulation?

Should I rethink the entire architecture for better scalability and decentralization?


This is just an early-stage demo, and I know security, task verification, and reputation systems and other stuff need to be added later. Right now, I want to get the architecture right before moving forward.


Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,ethereum,The Ungratefulness of Hating Vitalik Buterin,2025-02-13 13:02:18,"In the last few months Vitalik has frequently been target of abuse in crypto communities - in other subs and also across social media - especially from people who are upset about ETHs market performance

I think one of the most ungrateful things to do in this space is to hate Vitalik. Are people even aware that he imagined and created a brilliant blockchain platform that changed modern finance? At 19 years old - 19!!! When you were 19 what were you doing with your life? The creation of Ethereum was a technological revolution that built the basis for a new world - and it boosted the blockchains utility beyond its original intent

Even though the price isnt doing very good right now - Ethereum works as intended and has become safer with each upgrade. These haters ignore Ethereums immense impact and are either frustrated bag holders or butthurt maxis

Blockchain technology might not have progressed as far as it has without Vitaliks vision. Hating him fails to give the recognition he deserves for his contribution to the creation of Ethereum and consequently a large piece of the cryptocurrency sector. Plus the Ethereum Foundation has been working on changes. They pay attention to what the community has to say - people gotta learn to be patient instead of demanding action right away",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Today, in a regular 28-day restart cycle, we upgraded Ethereum to Pectra.

What does this mean? 

It means that if you operate a validator, or if you're thinking about it, you can now see how Max EB works in practice. You can [PoW mine](https://ephemery-faucet.pk910.de/) a thousand Ephemery Ether in a few minutes, and use that Ether to [launch validators](https://launchpad.ephemery.dev/en/) and use the 0x02 credential to stake up to 2048 Ether on one validator, and receive higher rewards for any whole number effective balance above 32. (In other words, you'll receive greater rewards if you stake 33, 34 Eth, etc.)

Ephemery is the PERFECT place to Fuck Around and Find Out how Pectra, Max EB, and 0x02 will affect validators.

The best part about all of this is you won't need to wait a long time for sync - because Ephemery resets every 28 days, there's no chain bloat to worry about.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum Simulations​ are getting better with eth_simulateV2,2025-02-14 01:20:21,"Ethereum developers heavily rely on transaction simulations to test and debug [smart contracts](https://etherworld.co/2017/09/18/smart-contract-an-introduction/) before deploying them on-chain. These simulations allow them to estimate gas usage, validate execution paths, and prevent costly errors. However, the current tools—such as `eth_simulate`, `eth_call`, and `estimateGas`—come with several limitations that make accurate transaction testing difficult.

As [Ethereum](https://etherworld.co/tag/ethereum/) continues to evolve, the demand for more advanced simulation features is growing. Developers need better debugging tools, more reliable gas estimation, and improved transaction validation. This is where eth\_simulateV2 comes in—a potential upgrade that could introduce new capabilities to make simulations more robust and developer-friendly.

The conversation revolves around Ethereum’s competitive advantage and an important update on the upcoming Pectra mainnet activation. Here’s what you need to know:

**Pectra Activation Delayed**

Ethereum developers initially planned a faster rollout for the Pectra upgrade, but feedback from Layer-2 projects and staking providers led to a change of course. Concerns about the timeline being too aggressive resulted in a one-month delay, ensuring at least 30 days between the final public testnet upgrade and the mainnet launch. This extra time will allow for better preparation and smoother implementation.



**Ethereum’s Competitive Edge in a Crowded Blockchain Space**

Christine also explores why Ethereum continues to lead despite new challengers in the blockchain ecosystem. Key strengths include:

* Established Ecosystem – A massive developer community and deep-rooted integrations.
* Security & Decentralization – A proven track record with robust security mechanisms.
* Network Effects – The most widely used smart contract platform, with significant institutional adoption.

With Ethereum evolving and competition heating up, this episode offers valuable insights into the future of the ecosystem.

does anyone have experience with staking ETH directly on Trust Wallet? Is everything going smooth and would you say that the risks are less than staking on an exchange?
Are rewards being paid out regularly?

I‘m planning to stake a little amount and let it ride for a few years. Just want to be sure nothing bad is going to happen.

What concerns me, is the post of u/Embarrassed_Ad_8406 , who was not able to redeem any rewards after staking large amount of ETH. 

And one additional question: is there any information which validators are being used when staking directly in the Trust Wallet app? I want to be sure that they are all legit and my ETH doesn’t land in LIDO or RocketPool. If this is the case, then I can simply skip Trust Wallet and use these services myself.

Reddit,ethereum,Why Ethereum’s Transition to Proof of Stake Was a Mistake,2025-02-14 04:38:11,"
Ethereum’s move from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in September 2022 was celebrated as a major milestone in blockchain history. The transition, known as The Merge, promised lower energy consumption, greater network security, and improved scalability. However, while PoS delivered on some of these promises, the shift has introduced significant trade-offs that threaten Ethereum’s decentralization, security, and long-term viability.

1. Centralization Concerns

One of the biggest issues with PoS is that it favors the wealthy. Unlike PoW, where miners compete using computational power, PoS grants more influence to those who already hold the most ETH. This creates a system where the rich get richer, leading to centralization of power among a few large staking entities. Currently, a handful of major validators—like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance—control a disproportionate share of staked ETH. This centralization contradicts Ethereum’s original ethos of decentralization.

2. Security Trade-Offs

While PoS is often touted as being more secure, it introduces new attack vectors. In PoW, an attacker would need to acquire a massive amount of computational power, making a 51% attack extremely expensive. In PoS, an attacker only needs to accumulate 51% of staked ETH, which is much easier, especially given the concentration of stake among a few entities. Moreover, if a major staking service is compromised or coerced by regulators, Ethereum’s network security is at risk.

3. Censorship Risks and Regulatory Capture

PoS makes Ethereum more susceptible to regulatory control. Because many of the largest validators are based in jurisdictions with strict compliance requirements, they may be forced to comply with government demands to censor transactions. This became evident when over 60% of Ethereum blocks were found to be compliant with OFAC regulations post-Merge, raising concerns about Ethereum’s ability to remain a neutral, censorship-resistant network.

4. Weakening of Network Participation

Under PoW, anyone with a GPU could contribute to the Ethereum network. This created a broad and diverse group of miners worldwide. PoS, however, requires a minimum of 32 ETH (~$100,000 at recent prices) to become a validator, pricing out small participants. As a result, Ethereum’s validator set is now dominated by institutions and large holders, reducing overall network participation and making Ethereum feel more like a corporate-run system than a decentralized blockchain.

5. Economic Model Flaws

The shift to PoS altered Ethereum’s economic model in ways that may prove unsustainable. The reduction in ETH issuance and the introduction of Ethereum staking yield has turned ETH into an interest-bearing asset. While this might seem like a positive, it introduces systemic risks. If ETH becomes seen as just another yield-generating financial instrument rather than a fundamental layer for decentralized applications, it risks losing its utility over time. Additionally, yield-seeking behavior could lead to reckless staking strategies that destabilize the ecosystem.

6. Loss of Miner Security

PoW provided Ethereum with a battle-tested security mechanism. While mining consumed energy, it also ensured that validators had real-world costs, making it difficult for attackers to manipulate the network. PoS eliminates this cost barrier, meaning bad actors no longer need to expend resources to exert influence. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transition led to a mass exodus of miners, many of whom were forced to switch to less secure and less profitable chains, fragmenting the broader PoW ecosystem.

Final Thoughts: The Cost of Efficiency

Ethereum’s transition to PoS was framed as a necessary step for sustainability, but it came at a steep price. While it reduced energy consumption, it introduced centralization risks, weakened security guarantees, and made the network more vulnerable to regulatory capture.

Ethereum was once seen as the most promising decentralized computing platform. By shifting to a model that benefits large institutions at the expense of decentralization, it may have sacrificed the very principles that made it valuable in the first place.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Threw together a quick app that let's you make your own ""Built on Ethereum"" Badge with a number of customization options.

First off, big shout outs to:

@[sassal0x](https://x.com/sassal0x) for kicking the hornets nest

[@jackbutcher](https://x.com/jackbutcher) for creating a community design to riff off of 

[@jalil\_eth](https://x.com/jalil_eth) for riffing on said design with the ""network badge"" concept.

The project uses html2canvas so probably works best in browsers like Chrome.

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,"Recovery Breadwallet iPhone 4s, jailbroken",2025-02-20 22:12:32,"I posted this in another sub already, I’m sorry if this is against the rules or smth. Also sorry for the format of the text, I’m on mobile right now and tried my best.

Hello people! 
Since the Bitcoin Price went up a lot in the last few years I went into my old stuff again and rembered that half destroyed iPhone 4s which the screen that works every 20 times u turn the screen on and off. I had a Breadwallet on that thing containing maybe 20€ at the 2014. I could use these 0,05 BTC (not sure about the numbers, could be a bit less or a bit more) pretty damn well right now but I can’t find that damn seed. I tried to unlock the app via pin too often a few years ago and it’s basically blocked forever (290000 days or smth). BUT: whenever I open the app it warns me that my iPhone is jailbroken and other jailbreak apps could read my keychains, grab my seed and steal my BTC. Now I’m trying to steal them myself. I’m kind of a noob tho and struggling with the process, maybe some of you guys has done something similar and can help.

The setup:

-iPhone 4s 
-iOS 7.1.2 
-jailbroken 
-Breadwallet (don’t know the version, last update probably around September 2014) 
-PC with windows 10 
-Really old Mac mini I used to try and look for the seed in old backup files from my 
-old disambled PC I used in 2014 with Hackintosh Snow Leopard as my main OS (this makes it hard to look for a file I could’ve stored the keyphrase in. Maybe I could try Linux on my recent pc and get or write a script to look through the files automatically?)

What I tried so far:

-looking manually through the app files on the iPhone via ifile and on windows -> got me pretty much nowhere

-looking through the Mac OS backup files manually with no success, have to look through my other harddrives tomorrow when I get a docking station for other harddrives

-installing python on my pc and Frida on my PC and iPhone to try and workaround the pin block screen. After I tried a lot of different things I finally got Frida installed and managed to run it but when I connected my iPhone to the pc (with and without iTunes running) it didn’t connect properly so I’m gonna buy a new cable and try this again tomorrow

What I thought might work:

-workaround the Lock Screen of bread wallet to access the wallet again

-reading out some useful info with keychain_dumper (I tried to do this but I couldn’t find open SSH in Cydia so I switched to another way of trying)

-finding my seed in my old hackintosh files ->by assembling my old pc again hoping everything works and I can boot from the hackintosh drive (kinda much effort for 50/50 i have a file or nah, can’t really remember) 
-> by connecting the harddrives to my Mac mini (which is really slow and a pain to use ->by installing some Linux (as a second OS on my main PC? 
—>Just bootable from an USB-Stick? 
—>Buy a raspberry pi and do it on that and use for more purpose? 
—->Which Linux should I use? 
—->Is it possible to game (lol, steam games, Minecraft) on Linux and 
—->switch to Linux as main OS?

I was interested in computer stuff a lot in my teens and kind of was the „tech-guy“ jailbreaking all the iPods of my friends and installing stuff for my family so I’m not afraid of trying things and diving deep but I never invested the time and really learned programming so I’m struggling a bit and in the last 6-8 year I mainly used tech for working and gaming so I’m just a noob.

Am open for any tutorials, ideas and help in any given way and probably will give people some of the cake via PayPal if the advice is constructive and helpful. Thank you guys.

I WONT: Send people any of my Mac OS Backup files. Send people any of my iPhone Backup files.

I WILL: Be nice to nice people.

Thanks.

TLDR: Jailbroken iPhone with a Breadwallet containing a few hundred to a few thousand € in BTC needs to be cracked. PIN blocked for 290000 days and seed lost (maybe in some old backup files hard to access) Help please!",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

The DCA portion of this is very straightforward, but I’m curious when people “buy the dip”? I know there is no right answer and it varies by person, but that’s kind of the point - I’m just curious what people are doing and if they’re buying more arbitrarily or if they have a system in place.

For example, do people buy 2x their DCA if it drops 5% in a day, week, month?

My DCA is currently 25USD and I’ve been buying 25USD more if it falls 1-2% in a day, but this doesn’t feel like a thoughtful process. 

Edit: I have a decent amount of cash (~10-15K) I’m trying to stack BTC with and want to make sure I’m buying in daily in case it moons now, but also have some cash to buy in bulk in the event of a massive dip.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

There's absolutely no one in the world who doesn't want to preserve their money. And what do you do to achieve that? You buy an asset to store your earnings, to not squander your workforce in fiat so governments inflate it and rob you while you sleep

Now Bitcoin has proven to be the superior asset in all comparisons, but it's still just getting out of niche forums and subreddits. There's still a LONG way for mass adoption

The current rapid volatility at a \~$100K price proves that it's still in its early ages, and that it will not stabilize until maybe it reaches millions of dollars per coin

As long as the cryptography is immutable, there's no way it's not going to a million dollars in the next few years.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The rCryptoCurrency Moon Week 58 Moon Burn Update and a Community Funded Moon giveaway.,2025-02-18 01:50:27,"Welcome to the Moon Burn Update for Moon Week 58. In this post we'll take a look at all Moon Burns between January 6th and February 2nd[.](https://imgur.com/a/10Jb44H) We'll also introduce a community funded Moon Giveaway (you can enter in the first 48 hours that this post is live).

# What are Moons:

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub. [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors on  as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit. (make sure you comment for a Moon Tip)

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days.

# Let's talk Moon Week 58 Moon Burns:

Between January 6th February 2nd:

* 28,844 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in two unique burn events:
* 28,587 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum One ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in ten unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is: 57,431 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Moons are the 11th most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum One **(up one since the last update)** with \~243k Moons having been burned so far on Arbitrum One

https://preview.redd.it/xjaahb0awsje1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=e645cd36b64eb8e430599e1f4c0fbb1163b3f2d4

Unlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the sole supply of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned by web three entities looking to host AMAs or customize the rCC banner.

\-----

Moons remain the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \~2.752M Moons having been burned to date and accounting for over 99.9% of the value of all tokens in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova.

The last burn update introduced a way to win 500 Moons by guessing how many Moons will be burned in 2025? Go to the last Moon Burn update and leave your guess (if you haven't yet done so).

Back when there were just a few projects, all focused on solving *real problems*—not this mess we’ve got now.

These days? It’s like every other hour there’s a new memecoin popping up with zero utility, just some pump-and-dump scheme to drain liquidity from actual projects that *deserve* attention. And people eat it up because “quick gains” are more exciting than long-term innovation.

What happened to building tech that could *change the world*?  
Now it’s just influencers shilling garbage, devs launching rug pulls, and everyone chasing the next hype train. No roadmap, no vision—just greed disguised as ""community.""

It’s exhausting. If you know, you know.  
If you’re still here for *real* crypto—actual use cases, long-term growth, and projects that *matter*—I see you. The rest? Good luck with your tenth dog-themed coin this month.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Meme Coins Are the New Dot-Com Bubble—And They’re Fucked,2025-02-20 16:10:42,"Meme coins are basically the dot-com bubble on steroids—same hype, same bullshit, just with more Twitter influencers pumping garbage. Back in the ’90s, slapping “.com” on a company name was enough to send stocks soaring, even if the company had no business model, no revenue, and no real plan. Sound familiar? Remember Pets.com? Went public with a $300 million valuation, dead a year later. eToys? Worth $8 billion at its peak—bankrupt in months.

Now fast forward to today, and we’ve got the same circus with meme coins. Dogecoin, created as a literal joke, hit an $88 billion market cap—bigger than some of the biggest companies on the planet. Shiba Inu, another pointless token, once flipped Doge in valuation. And let’s not even talk about the thousands of useless meme coins that pop up daily, each promising to be “the next big thing” while offering absolutely nothing. It’s all just glorified gambling with fancy dog logos.

And trust me, I’ve seen this shit before. I bought eBay back in the day when it was dirt cheap, but like an idiot, I sold it for a small profit instead of holding on. If I had kept it, I’d be sitting on a fortune. But at least I was investing in something real—an actual business with revenue, not some pump-and-dump meme coin that’s just gonna vanish when the hype dies.

And here’s the kicker—just like the dot-com crash wiped out 90% of those garbage stocks, the same fate is coming for meme coins. The second regulations hit and the big money moves on to actual projects with real utility, all this meme coin bullshit is going to collapse. Sure, a few might survive, just like Amazon and Google did after the dot-com crash, but the rest? They’re fucked. And the only people left holding the bag will be the ones who thought this shit was gonna last forever.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

It's the coin that has shown to be solid, has a solid network and security, doesn't have questionable teams behind it, is more than decentralized enough, and the coin people trust the most to work.

It's solid, when it comes to holding your coins digitally like gold.

But it's not the end all answer to all crypto problems.

# Other coins and chains that will still be needed:

**1- A fast and cheap point of sale crypto.**

There will still be a need for a coin with fast and cheap transactions, that's scalable, with a chain that can handle heavy traffic. Something easy to integrate in point of sales systems, that's easy for buying a coffee.

**2- A dev chain.**

A blockchain built for developers, that's more ideal to build on, with smart contracts.

**3- A business chain.**

Similar to a dev chain, but more business oriented.

**4- Industry specialized chains or projects.**

Some industries like real estate, medical, scientific research, social media, gaming, etc.. may require a more specialized chain for their industry. Just for a few cases where a dev/business/trilemma chain may not be enough.

**5- Chains or projects specialized in a specific tech feature.**

These are your chains or projects specialized in a key tech solution like oracle, indexing, interoperability, IOT, AI, etc...

**6- A trilemma chain.**

This will be your swiss army chain. The chain that solves the trilemma and is strong enough at security, scalability, and decentralization.

# Coins and chains that won't be needed (probably 90% of what's out there):

1- Any chain that's not doing something new or doing something other chains are already doing, and not even doing it better.

2- Any chain that's doing something too centralized.

3- Any chain that's not solving a tech problem, a lifestyle problem, a business problem, or an industry problem.

4- Any token where the token itself is not needed in the system.

5- Any project with too much control from a team, or a poor team behind it.

6- Anything that's not bringing something to the table.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Safemoon Executive Thomas Smith changes plea from ""Not Guilty"" to ""Guilty"". John Karony to follow?",2025-02-20 21:53:40,"DOMINO, BIATCH!  

What is up ladies and gents. I'm back, and I'm *still talking about Safe fucking moon!*  

I'll be real, the interest on this shit has turned up to 11 since the arrest of John Karony & Thomas Smith way back on Halloween 2023.  

###Where to begin?  

---  

The legal case has been **fascinating**. Thomas Smith and John were arrested. Thomas was let out on bail after agreeing to co-operate, whereas John was jailed in some grotty New York prison for 3 months. He got out on $3m bail, paid by his parents, in exchange for dropping the [lawsuit he had on his own mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xrmlxu/safemoon_ceo_john_karony_sues_his_own_mother_in/)  

To date, John's defense arguments have been as follows:  

* Extraterritoriality - ""You can't convict me under these US Laws because Safemoon runs on Binance Blockchain which isn't a US Blockchain""  
* Public Disclosure - ""Even though I made representations in plain English about the status of the Liquidity Pool locks, anyone could've followed the blockchain evidence and found that I was in fact acting in contradiction to my prior statements  
* Public Authority Defense - ""I spoke to an FBI Agent while I was working at Safemoon, and he didn't sanction my actions"" (*Footnote, John hasn't submitted this as an actual defense, and the FBI Agent in question apparently had no understanding of Cryptocurrency) 

As you can see, these aren't great arguments to combat charges of Wire Fraud, Securities Fraud and Money Laundering.  

In fact, they all look like loopholes to me, and in lieu of any actual defense, in combination with the blockchain evidence, chat logs, private messages and social media posts that all corroborate the blockchain evidence, it sure seems like John is guilty as fuck.  

---  

###So while all that's going on.. 

Today, after not really hearing from Thomas or his lawyers for a long time, [Thomas Smith has officially entered into court to change his plea from ""Not Guilty"" to ""Guilty""](https://x.com/live4offrd/status/1892652885051375703)  

What this means is that Thomas should be looked at slightly more favourably by the Government, instead of dragging out a trial. He could provide more information to help them secure a conviction against Karony, and might even avoid jailtime entirely, but that's my speculation.  


---  
###That's Thomas and John... Where's Kyle Nagy?  


So Kyle was the third executive charged by the DOJ & SEC. He was never arrested. Nobody knew where he was, for a very long time, [until this salacious news story popped up from Russia of all places.](https://www.newsweek.com/safemoon-florida-man-crypto-fraud-russia-fsb-2010979)  

As a summary, Kyle was living with his family in Dubai when the indictments were unsealed. He had a Russian contact, who recommended he relocate to Russia and that this contact could get him a golden visa in exchange for $1m. When he got set up in Russia, he ran afoul of some corrupt FSB agents who continued to extort him, threatening violence against his family. Apparently, he went to the Russian police and submitted a legal complaint about them, which is how we know about it.  

So which of the two punishments do Safemoon executives deserve? Federal prison, or a Russian gulag?",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Seems like ages since I first posted about this project on here, a few years ago a bunch of us from this sub got together to build a trading bot platform with the features we wished other platforms had. Today we celebrate our biggest release yet",2025-02-20 21:59:12,"We've been working on this tool for about 3 years now, and it's kind of amazing to think that this sub brought us together in the first place.

We're a team of 6 people, and all of us met through the various discussions on this sub, and decided we want to build a better trading bot platform.

Before I continue - let me quickly clarify what that is as there's some misconception about trading bots (most likely due to how many of them market themselves).

A Trading bot platform is not some magical passive income machine, that makes you rich while you sleep as some would have you believe. It's a tool that helps you automate or find new viable strategies through testing your results in an iterative process. So a bot will only be as good as you'll configure it to be. The truth is if your go to is to buy high and sell low, it will help you do that - just more consistently and efficiently.

So anyway, when we started building this, we had some idea of the complexity of the tool, but one thing that turned out to be a lot more challenging than we thought is the infrastructure layer of the app, which determines how the app scales with user demand.

  
Another pain point we came across was the UI itself. Some of you that tested the tool said it's not intuitive enough and there's some jank to it - and I couldn't agree more. I mean the first version was super rough. We then made some incremental improvements, however, it wasn't until this release that the app is really getting closer to the original vision, at least in terms of the UX.

We took something that looked like this:

https://preview.redd.it/x6g2b4ll7dke1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4abfd7226beb327d038b60537ff43a80369f510c

Aesir (the app's name) has really come a long way both in terms of functionality as well as ease of use and I wanted to share this update with you all. We're going to continue working on it and add more features. Our long-term vision is for Aesir to be an all-in-one portfolio management tool, that can help you manage your investments across multiple asset classes and even automatically re-balance for instance between stocks and crypto based on your instructions.

That's far in the future but I think there's a lot of value in that.

The app is free to use and all strategies can be tested before deploying live, so feel free to give it a try if you like. And if you have any ideas on how to improve the tool, let me know!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Shorting Solana and Why I’m doing it (Solana Fan),2025-02-20 13:48:41,"So I’m a long term solana buyer and holder.

I’ve made great returns on it, but recently I believe I miscalculated what was going to happen after the trump pump.

I was holding on to an older way of thinking, and because I didn’t sell near the trump pump high, I was waiting to get back to those highs. I’m sure many of you are doing this rn.

However I decided to get on the sideline with SOL after the Libra scandal because my profits were sliding away fast. I’m not a hodlr, I like to time the market strategically during market trends. This has worked very well for me, with some bad calls here and there.

Given that background, I’ve been conducting a significant amount of market research on Solana and want to provide you all this information so you’re not stuck in an echo chamber 

Negative Narrative:

Solana has earned its way to the scammers paradise through meme pump and dumps

Solana already had a huge run up the last 1-2 years

FTX reimbursements are entering the market soon

LIBRA scandal (there is more to this watch the coffeezilla video) this could get a lot more ugly if what’s reported is true

Potential for exchange crash. There seems to be a huge scandal on an exchange every cycle. In this case there may be a black swan event around USDC (SOL) or JUP or another platform. (This is a stretch, but if it were gonna happen somewhere I believe it would happen on the solana network this cycle)

Other networks are viewed as more reliable or for serious business like Ethereum or Cardano

Positive Narrative:

SOL can do what it’s always done, provide a network for extremely fast and cost effective transactions 

Tax feee American cryptos

That’s about it

Price movement:

Everyone is aware how poorly SOL is doing in the last 7-30 days. It’s been hit a lot worse than the rest of the market. Even though the market is in the red, SOL is significantly lower

SOL price chart shows SOL about to dump right before the Trump Pump. One could argue we would have been at the current price sooner if not for that event.

Next lower resistance is in the 150s and then the 120s. With so much FUD, I would not be surprised that if we break through 160 that we end up at 120 in a 7 day period.

Competition:

XRP has positive narratives currently and none of the negative environment that surrounds solana

Ethereum is the first mover and 2nd largest crypto. It has a huge L2 network for low fees and has a lot of room for price growth this cycle

SUI, like solana without all the FUD

Conclusion:

Given all this information, I believe SOL will reach 120s as the new low and hold in that price area for the remainder of the alt bull run while other coins prosper. 

It may go even lower once alt season ends and we are in a true bear market.

I am a huge fan of SOL, it is my favorite crypto. However my main goal is to make money, and this is how I am seeing it.

As Thanos would say, “I’m sorry little one”

I’m shorting SOL

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Privacy? A lost feature of crypto,2025-02-20 22:57:02,"I want to prephase this post by saying that I wanted to be apart of crypto for its privacy features that I heard almost a decade ago. Today, this is more and more lost. Things like KYC, the public wallets of people and more are becoming increasingly dangerous to the privacy side of crypto.

While yes, it’s great that some things are transparent, I really fell in love with Monero, Kaspa and recently Xelis. 

So I’ve been waiting to ask people here what do they think about privacy? Would they prefer to see a more privacy focus in crypto? Are you okay with the current status quo with the more popular not PoW chains like Sol, Eth or Sui that are the opposite of private as opposed to the ones cited earlier?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The FOMC Minutes Reveal a Hidden Liquidity Boost? - Fed May Pause Balance Sheet Reduction Due to Debt Ceiling - Bullish for Crypto?,2025-02-20 13:47:11,"Today I crossed with this [Tweet](https://x.com/Daily_Cripto/status/1892314471290343676) that talks about something interesting found in the FOMC minutes from January. As you may already know, yesterday, the [FOMC minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250219a.htm) from the January meeting were released. This document talks about that the inflation risks are still a concern, that rate cuts won't happen soon, etc. But there was one unexpected change that almost no one is talking about which is the FED's balance sheet policy.

https://preview.redd.it/fwxy6leftake1.jpg?width=1244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7bdb811dc28b5111556eb21e577a1126d8d6e31

In that document you can see a very important comment regarding debt ceiling situation claiming that some members suggested that it might be necessary to pause or slow down the balance sheet reduction until this issue is resolved.

This means that the FED might stop selling treasury bonds from its balance sheet in the market because of the risks tied to the debt ceiling situation coming up in the next few months. If they decide to pause it this will mean that there will be more liquidity in the market that results on higher prices because there is money flowing and I have just to remember that crypto are hot topics and very attractive right now. More liquidity = higher prices.

# Are we closer to a liquidity boost?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why Litecoin (LTC) Could Be #2 Again 🚀,2025-02-19 18:42:04,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share why I think Litecoin (LTC) has a real shot at climbing back to the top and maybe even becoming the #2 crypto again. It might sound crazy, but hear me out:

**BTW, something I did want to point out that is really funny.**

**Notice how no influencers are talking about LTC as a hidden gem? Well, it's because they aren't getting paid like they do from other chains. LOL!**

1. **Decentralized Like BTC** – Out of all the coins in the top 20, LTC is one of the only ones that’s truly decentralized, just like Bitcoin. No central authority, no big team pulling strings.
2. **Old & Trusted** – Litecoin has been around since 2011. It’s battle-tested and trusted by tons of people in the crypto space. It’s like the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.
3. **Grayscale Is Loading Up** – Grayscale has been stacking LTC for years. They probably know something we don’t. Institutions don’t buy this much of a coin unless they see serious potential.
4. **MimbleWimble Upgrade** – LTC has privacy features like MimbleWimble, making privacy coins like Monero kinda irrelevant. You get both transparency and optional privacy.
5. **Atomic Swaps with BTC** – You can swap LTC and BTC directly without using an exchange. With Bitcoin’s fees so high and network congestion, this is HUGE.
6. **Strong During Dumps** – During one of the biggest market dumps of the year, LTC not only held its ground but actually went up! That’s a big sign that something is happening behind the scenes.
7. **LTC ETFs Incoming?** – The SEC is reviewing potential LTC ETFs. If they get approved, we could see massive institutional money flow in. Litecoin is not classified as a security either, which means its much more likely to be sped into a ETF IMO. 
8. **Unique Positioning** – LTC isn’t competing with smart contract coins like SOL, ADA, or ETH. Its only real competition is BTC, which makes it unique and fills a different niche.

**And here are 3 more reasons why LTC could be ready for a breakout:**

1. **Low Fees & Fast Transactions** – Compared to BTC and ETH, LTC has way lower fees and faster transaction times, making it actually usable for day-to-day spending.
2. **Undervalued & Forgotten** – Let’s be honest, LTC has been flying under the radar for years. While everyone was chasing new shiny projects, LTC kept improving. It’s like finding a gem before the crowd notices.
3. **Halving Effects Still in Play** – The recent LTC halving reduced mining rewards, which historically leads to price increases over time due to reduced supply. BTC halving pumps, so why not LTC?",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why Cardano (ADA) Could Be the King Again 👑,2025-02-20 13:31:45,"Hey everyone!  I wanted to drop some thoughts on why I'm seriously thinking Cardano (ADA) has a real shot at not just climbing back up, but maybe even reclaiming the crypto throne.  Yeah, I said it – King.  Sounds bold, right?  Well, buckle up and let me lay it out for you:

See how you don't hear the same kind of breathless hype about ADA from the usual crypto gurus these days?  Wonder why?  Maybe because building something groundbreaking and actually decentralized doesn't pay for the same kind of flashy promo deals as, you know, other chains.  Just sayin'. 😉

 * Decentralized from the Ground Up –  Look around at the top cryptos.  Cardano isn't just talking decentralization, it was built with it in its DNA, right from the scientific papers up.  No single point of failure, no centralized control freaks. It's for the people, by the people (well, smart people, but you get it).

 * Built to Last & Scientifically Backed – Cardano hasn’t been around quite as long as BTC, but since 2017, it's been forged in the fires of rigorous research and peer-review.  It’s not some fly-by-night project; it’s meticulously crafted, like the Swiss watch of blockchains. Trusted by those who understand that solid foundations matter.

 * Institutions Are Waking Up – Smart money is starting to notice Cardano's potential. Think enterprise solutions, real-world use cases, and the growing realization that Cardano is built for the long game. Institutions don't just dip their toes in; they jump in when they see a paradigm shift coming.

 * Next-Level Tech - Smart Contracts & Scalability – Forget old news. Cardano's smart contracts are here, and they are evolving. Plus, with solutions like Hydra coming online, scalability is being tackled head-on. We're talking about tech that can handle real global adoption, not just hype cycles.

 * Bridging the Chains - Future of Interoperability – Cardano isn't an island.  The focus on interoperability and cross-chain solutions means it's designed to play well with others. In a multi-chain future, being the friendly, adaptable giant is a massive advantage.

 * Community Strong, Market Resilient –  During market dips?  Check Cardano’s performance. The community is diamond-handed and believes in the mission.  That kind of conviction is rare and speaks volumes about the project's underlying strength.

 * Regulatory Ready - Future-Proof Foundation – Cardano's methodical approach and focus on working with regulators, not against them, positions it incredibly well for the evolving regulatory landscape.  This isn't just about today's market; it's about building something compliant and sustainable for the decades to come.  ETFs down the line?  ADA is primed.

 * Unique Vision - Blockchain for Global Impact – Cardano isn’t trying to be just another DeFi playground.  It's aiming for something bigger:  real-world impact in developing nations, identity solutions, supply chain transparency, and more.  It’s got a purpose beyond just price pumps, and that resonates with a lot of people.

And here are 3 more sparks to ignite the ADA rocket:
 * Scalable & Sustainable - Low Fees, High Speed –  As Cardano’s scaling solutions mature, expect to see lightning-fast transactions and fees that are a fraction of legacy chains.  Usability for the everyday person?  Check.  Sustainability for the planet? Double-check (Proof-of-Stake, baby!).
 * Undervalued & Underestimated - Sleeping Giant – Let's be real, Cardano has been in a building phase.  While others grabbed headlines with fleeting trends, Cardano was laying the groundwork.  Now, with the tech maturing and real use cases emerging, the market is starting to wake up to its true potential.  Time to pay attention.
 * Staking Power & Tokenomics - Rewards and Scarcity –  Staking ADA isn't just about earning rewards (though that’s nice!).  It's about participating in the network, securing the future, and understanding sound tokenomics with a capped supply.  It's not just holding, it's empowerment and long-term value.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

# How did this Phishing Attack Happen

The victim appeared to sign multiple malicious transactions. Perhaps the victim engaged with a fake website that promised rewards or a fake airdrop page. Nevertheless, the victim gave the phishing scammer approvals for AETHWETH and two Doodles NFTs.

The attack could of been much worse as the victim still currently has another 3.79M in AETHWETH and 479K in AETHUSDT in their wallet.

Phishing attacks in Jan - Feb 2025 are actually down as compared to the same timeframe last year. Almost everyday this time last year, single victims were losing 6 and 7 figures to wallet drainers.

Much of the reduction in phishing drainer losses can be attributed to improvements in anti-phishing technology like Blockaid.

This latest attack appears to be a workaround that was not caught by these anti-phishing platforms. The cat and mouse game continues!

I've written about phishing attacks from Inferno Drainer before. Here's a few previous posts

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1c9o8ix/760k\_stolen\_through\_inferno\_drainer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1c9o8ix/760k_stolen_through_inferno_drainer/)

Traditionally drainer services have operated by the 80/20 rule. 80% of the stolen assets go to the CUSTOMER and 20% go to the drainer ADMIN team. 

However, this isn't a hard rule. Sometimes the split can be 85/15, 75/25 or some variation.

On Oct 20th 2024, the Inferno Drainer platform was acquired by Angel Drainer.

[The above is from the Inferno Drainer telegram channel announcing the transition to Angel Drainer.](https://preview.redd.it/gvxo07t8tyje1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=5866f3f189e735c6efddd232d21114a38065d113)

Some say the reason behind Inferno Drainer exiting the wallet drainer scene was due to law enforcement catching up while others believe the profitability and future growth potential was limited due to anti-phishing improvements.

Nevertheless, the drainer platform former known as Inferno Drainer is now InfernoAngel Drainer.

# Following the Funds

[Above is the flow of funds from the Victim's wallet to the Drainer Admin team and Drainer Customer wallets.](https://preview.redd.it/a0lh5wog2zje1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb6e82eb2364c9a6f6727a5759c2f07f385f2340)

Most of the funds for **InfernoAngel CUSTOMER** \- 0x9039085515506e6bB0b81Ab15bc4e155CB2eE039 is yet to be laundered. I'm showing about 516K in mostly ETH sitting in the wallet.

There is some small deposits into 0xaDD6937C3Ee1BC8e22fd74226bdECAA428b1a8B9 - MEXC and 0x161647F0071D56B52467f7F0Ee54870954ac257E - Binance but those appear to be service addresses vs belonging to the attacker.

I did notice about 34 ETH was sent to 0x201128051dFCfb3151917e488024CCFa9fC54d93, eventually bridged to Thorchain, and sent to a Litecoin address - ltc1qp2lyz9vrfzshnf0qj06cxhy2mt2lcpsxyvesmf

The **InfernoAngel ADMIN** \- 0x1FE92e288b2b2792BCdEe8b8F286e0ed16724Da6 wallet is only about 3 weeks old but also has significant assets yet to be laundered, about 666K at the time of this writing.

A quick twitter search will show the numerous phishing scams connected to this address. 

For the funds that were laundered, I was able to find a number of deposit addresses linked directly to the Inferno ADMIN

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Meme Coins are the death of the crypto verse,2025-02-18 08:52:14,"Ben Cowen a well respected crypto analyst was talking about how meme coins has rext this cycle, 36 million crypto coins exist now in the crypto space. Liquidity is all over the place, and that's one of the main drivers why the crypto market has stalled, when in post halving year Q1 has traditionally been bull runs for bitcoin and alt coins. Now everything is either bleeding against bitcoin, and bitcoin itself has stayed ranging sideways for the last several weeks, unable to touch the ATH again. Most alt coins have either gone back down or lost majority of their gains since November. Except for a few like the big four.

I agree with Ben when he says, retail hasn't come back to the crypto market like the previous cycles, because meme coin rug pulls has either scared away the retail market or they had a bad taste of getting rugged and losing their money and just going away after. Without retailing coming back, there is no alt season. There is no liquidity, there is only SO MUCH ""wall street"" can buy into. I honestly think we might not get an alt season at all this cycle, meme coins and rug pulls is all you hear on the news now. Where in previous cycles the news was filled with people getting rich over night, now it's just stories of people losing their money over night.

When 15 year old kids with no coding experience can make meme coins and rug pull people, or ditzy blonde girls who are famous for blow jobs, can scam the regular people out of their life savings, president of countries rug pulling people, do you think anyone takes crypto serious anymore? Meme coins has always been tolerated before in previous cycles, but this cycle, meme coins might just be the death of the crypto space in general. Just my two cents.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

For someone new to crypto, things like ease of use, security, and overall experience matter a lot. Price might also be a factor, but the main goal is to find a wallet that’s safe and simple to use without overwhelming.

Spreading the word, as I think the project has a rather solid idea that has not been put to use before.

🎲 Lottery Token (LOT) - Decentralized Lottery Protocol

Lottery Token redefines blockchain lotteries through true automation. By holding 20,000 LOT, you're automatically entered into every draw - no tickets needed, no manual entries required.

The mechanism is straightforward: Each transaction includes a 7% fee - 5% feeds the prize pool, while 2% funds ecosystem development. When the prize pool reaches 1 million tokens, a random holder wins automatically. Our Chainlink VRF integration ensures completely fair and verifiable winner selection.

Beyond the core lottery, we're building an ecosystem of lottery-themed features. Our first addition is already live - a Telegram-based game where holders can play daily for real LOT token rewards. This represents our commitment to expanding utility while maintaining the lottery theme.

Built on BASE chain, we leverage low transaction fees and high network activity to ensure sustainable prize distributions and frequent draws. Every holder has an equal chance of winning, regardless of their total holdings above the minimum threshold.

This isn't another meme token - it's a utility-focused protocol bringing automated, fair, and verifiable lottery mechanics to DeFi.

Sure, they are not down 99% like the solana memecoins, but most of them are still down significantly, and considering HODLers typically take their investment seriously, they are more likely to put much more life savings into their dear utility tokens.

It's hillarious. The only coin worth to be HODL long term is Bitcoin. this cycle proves it. There's a reason why most top 100 alts from the previous cycle are still very far away from their ATH.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

I know pre-Quantum Asymmetric systems reasonably well & I also understand Abstract Algebra reasonably well.

Is understanding the basics enough - if yes, what would constitute basics in a typical book on Coding Theory (I need to look for the right book also).

**EDIT:** For e.g. to understand Pre-Quantum Elliptic Curve Cryptography, I don't need to know deep algebraic geometry - just the basics are enough - I don't need to know Affine Varieties, Isogenies, Riemann–Roch, Divisors, Weil Conjectures etc as long as I am not planning to design something new based on ECs.

Reddit,crypto,NIST STS questions and use with encrypted data,2025-02-19 01:34:34,"**Hello cryptos.**

I'm testing output of an encryption algorithm and would like to know if a test collection of STS results of a very high quantity will be meaningful.

My test plan that I'm running right now...

1. Creation of 803 cleartext samples across 7 groups:
   * **RepetitivePatterns**
      * These are things like repeating bytes, repeating tuple and triples, repeating short ordered sequences, and so on.
      * The patterns are of increasing sizes from around 511 bytes to just over 4MB.
   * **LowEntropy**
      * These are cleartext samples that have only a few available bytes in total to distribute.
      * Some samples are just random orders and others are cases where the few bytes are separated by large runs of another like: `AnnnnnnnBnnnCnnnnnnnnBnnnnnnC`
   * **NaturalLanguage**
      * These are randomly constructed English language sentences and paragraphs.
      * Of varying lengths, varying sentences per paragraph, and varying quantity of paragraphs.
   * **RandomData**
      * Varying lengths of random bytes from a CSRNG.
   * **PreCompressed**
      * Using the same construction from NaturalLanguage, Brotli compress the data and use that as cleartext samples.
      * Also of varying lengths.
   * **BinaryExe**
      * Enumerate files from the local file system for DLL/EXE files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Windows\System32` and subfolders.
   * **Structured**
      * Enumerate XML/HTML/JSON/RTF/CSV files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Program Files` and subfolders.
2. For each cleartext, encrypt and append the output (without padding) to a file. 
3. Run ENT for the file as well as STS. STS params are: 2 million bits length and 100 streams, enabling all tests (takes about 9-12 mins per file). 
4. Record the results in a DB.

**Am I misinterpreting the value of STS for analyzing encrypted data?**  
**Will I gain any useful insights by this plan?**

I've run it for about 24 hours so far and have done over **9 million encrypts** and over **1100 STS executions**.  
Completion will be just over **3000 runs** and near **20 million encrypts**.

For any that are curious, I created a sandbox that uses the same encryption here:  [https://bllnbit.com](https://bllnbit.com)

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,crypto,On The Security Of SHA3 (Keccak),2025-01-19 15:29:56,"Hello,

I am wondering for any information on the security of SHA3 and its sponge function versus older hash functions like MD5, SHA1, SHA2.

What makes it more secure? How heavily studied has it been. The sponge function is still newer than the other constructions but its internal state is quite large.

I am looking for hash functions with good security margins.

BLAKE2 and SHA3 are so far the best looking but is there any reason I should look at SHA2 again because it’s well studied.

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Thanks",2025-02-21 00:53:24.265581
Reddit,crypto,Excited to share my latest research in Privacy Preserving Authentication technology!,2024-12-24 13:29:34,"🌟 **Dear Scientists, Researchers, Scholars, and Enthusiasts,** 🌟

I am **thrilled** to announce the pre-print of my latest research paper, now available on the [International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) ePrint archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2066). 📚✨

>**Goal**: To authenticate accurately and securely **without revealing both virtual public identifiers** (e.g., usernames, user IDs) **and real-world identifiers** (e.g., passwords, biometrics, or other secrets).

💡 **Introducing COCO:**  
A **full-consensus, zero-knowledge authentication protocol** designed with:

* 🔒 **Efficiency**
* 🕵️‍♂️ **Unlinkability**
* ⏳ **Asynchrony**
* 🌐 **Liveness**

COCO is built on **Coconut credentials**—a selective disclosure, re-randomizable credential scheme—and **Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRF)** to ensure both **privacy** and **scalability** in distributed frameworks.

🎯 This research is part of a larger project under **Statecraft Laboratories** to create a **privacy-first virtual space**.

🛠️ **Explore the Codebase:**  
Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/14morpheus14/coco).

Reddit,crypto,Book for introduction to cryptography,2024-12-23 13:49:23,"I am looking for a book for beginners, explaining all the concepts for key sharing, block and stream ciphers, vulnerabilities, polygons, where primes come in the picture, etc. Possibly supplemented with examples, as well as real-world ciphers and how they are distinct, what makes them special etc.

I read a fair few wikipedia pages about these topics, but lets be honest, wp doesn't really cut it beyond the basic stuff. Other than that, I am completely agnostic to crypto, but have a - what i liketo think is- firm mathematical basis.

Most probably involve marshalling together some symmetrically encrypted data along with a metadata block that includes details on key management and transports the data encryption key wrapped with recipient key(s).


Would love any well-designed examples I can look at for ideas, or problems you've encountered with such designs and implementations.


Currently I have:

  * PKCS#7 (S/MIME, PEM)
  * PGP
  * Crypt4GH
  * AGE
