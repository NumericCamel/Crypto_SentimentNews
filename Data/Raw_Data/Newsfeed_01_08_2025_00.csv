In December 2024, the volume of BTC acquired through Spot Bitcoin ETFs more than tripled the amount mined during that same month, underscoring the severe imbalance between supply and demand.  Spot Bitcoin ETFs Trigger Supply Shock Risks In December 2024, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased an astonishing 51,500 BTC. On the other hand, BTC miners produced only 13,850 coins during the same period, according to data from Blockchain.com. This indicates that Bitcoin ETFs alone purchased nearly four times the amount BTC miners generated and supplied to the market that month.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent According to reports, the demand for ETFs in December was nothing short of extraordinary, exceeding the available supply by approximately 272%. This massive increase in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has raised concerns about a potential BTC supply shock, with analysts suggesting that it could happen soon.  Specifically, Lark Davis, a crypto analyst, announced earlier in December that “a massive supply shock is imminent.” The analyst based this alarming forecast on the significant accumulation of BTC from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Davis disclosed that at some point in December, BTC ETFs had bought 21,423 BTC; meanwhile, miners had produced only 3,150 BTC around the same time.  The analyst also noted that BTC ETFs globally held approximately 1,311,579 BTC as of December 17, 2024. This amount, valued at $139 billion, accounts for 6.24% of BTC’s total supply of 19.8 million. Given this staggering figure, Davis projects that during peak bull market phases, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could hold 10-20% of BTC’s total supply, raising more concerns about a major supply shock.  Concentration Of Spot BTC Inflows In December Data from Glassnode has revealed that Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $4.63 billion in December, almost doubling their 2024 monthly average of $2.77 billion. Notably, Glassnode disclosed that the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows was more concentrated during the first half of the month, while the second half saw outflows, with December 26 being the exception.  Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? Not surprisingly, the timing for this surge and subsequent decline in Bitcoin ETF inflows aligns with BTC’s price movements in December. At the beginning of the month, BTC experienced upward momentum, skyrocketing to a new ATH above $108,000 on December 17, fueled by the bull market hype and soaring demand. However, following this peak, BTC’s price saw a sharp decline, a drop that coincided with the timing of significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, as reported by Glassnode.  Despite the surge in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs in December, new data shows that investors have extended their accumulation trend into January 2025. On January 3, investors purchased over $900 million worth of BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. More recently, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs acquired an additional 9,500 BTC, worth over $966 million at the current market price.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Crypto Market Will Peak In Mid To Late March, Predicts Arthur Hayes",2025-01-07 22:30:15+00:00,"In a new essay published on Monday, Arthur Hayes—renowned digital asset investor and former CEO of BitMEX—contends that the crypto market is poised to rally strongly in the first quarter of 2025 before topping out sometime in “mid to late March.” Hayes’s latest essay, titled “Sasa,” delves deep into several macroeconomic variables, including US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy, US Treasury General Account (TGA) balances, the Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP), and political uncertainty in Washington. Hayes began his essay by setting a vivid scene from Japan’s Hokkaido ski resorts, likening dangerous backcountry conditions caused by insufficient snow cover over sharp bamboo grass (sasa) to potential market obstacles that could cut short crypto rallies. He observes that 2025 has kicked off amid robust snowfall in Hokkaido—an apt metaphor for what he sees as a liquidity “dumping” that could propel digital asset prices upward. Nonetheless, he warns that the political and fiscal environment in the United States may introduce unexpected hazards. Why March Could Mark The Next Peak For Crypto “As we begin 2025, the question on crypto investors’ minds is whether the Trump pump can continue,” Hayes writes, referencing the initial optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s second term. While Hayes believes “the high expectations for policy action out of the Trump camp set up the market for disappointment,” he maintains that any short-term negativity could be offset by a powerful “dollar liquidity impulse.” Related Reading: Crypto Trader Nets $17 Million From AI Coins: Here’s What He’s Buying Now Hayes underscores that the Fed’s RRP has been critical for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Since the third quarter of 2022, the facility’s unwinding has correlated positively with crypto and equities prices. “Bitcoin bottomed in Q3 2022 when the Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) reached its zenith,” he explains, noting that US Treasury Secretary Janet “Bad Gurl” Yellen facilitated a shift from issuing longer-dated coupon bonds to issuing shorter-dated T-bills. This approach, he argues, effectively drained more than $2 trillion from the RRP, injecting liquidity into global markets. Now, with the RRP falling to almost zero, the Fed has “belatedly changed the policy rate of the RRP” to make it less attractive. Hayes points out that it still represents a potential $237 billion injection into markets once the remaining RRP funds move into higher-yielding Treasury bills. Meanwhile, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT) removes $60 billion per month, totaling $180 billion between January and March. Netting both factors yields a $57 billion injection over the quarter. Another major focus in Hayes’s thesis is the Treasury General Account. As debt ceiling negotiations loom, the Treasury’s inability to issue new debt means it can only cover expenses by spending down the TGA—an action that releases liquidity. “Because the aggregate amount of debt cannot rise until the US Congress increases the debt ceiling, the Treasury can only spend funds from its checking account, the TGA,” Hayes writes, noting that the balance stands at around $722 billion. Related Reading: This Week’s Top Crypto Catalysts: What Investors Need To Watch He estimates that without a debt ceiling resolution, the TGA could be exhausted by May or June. For crypto markets, the crux of the matter is the timescale for a deal in Congress. The essay highlights Trump’s narrow majority and the likelihood that Republicans who position themselves as fiscally conservative will not grant quick or easy consent. Democrats, Hayes adds, are unlikely to facilitate enabling more spending for a president they oppose—further fueling legislative brinkmanship. According to Hayes’s calculations, TGA drawdowns could release an additional $555 billion from January through March. If combined with the $57 billion net liquidity from the Fed’s RRP and QT adjustments, total dollar liquidity could rise by as much as $612 billion in the first quarter. Hayes zeroes in on March as the critical juncture—when this liquidity surge might begin to wane and expectations for new federal spending or pro-crypto legislation from the Trump administration may not materialize on schedule. “I believe I answered the question I posed at the outset. That is, the sasa of a letdown by team Trump on his proposed pro-crypto and pro-business legislation can be covered by an extremely positive dollar liquidity environment,” he states, before concluding that peak liquidity could subside quickly once the market anticipates the debt ceiling’s resolution and the subsequent refilling of the TGA. From a historical lens, Hayes cites Bitcoin’s price action in 2024, which peaked in mid-March around $73,000, then drifted sideways and tumbled just before the April 15 tax deadline. The reasoning, he suggests, is straightforward: as soon as TGA spending has run its course, the net positive liquidity picture reverts to neutral or negative, leaving risk assets vulnerable. While Hayes acknowledges that Chinese credit expansion, Bank of Japan interest rate policies, and the Trump administration’s potential dollar devaluation strategy against other major currencies or gold could upend his timeline, he trusts that RRP and TGA mechanics are reliable near-term gauges. Crucially, these twin sources of liquidity appear powerful enough to overshadow any disappointment about Trump’s policies until at least the end of March. “None of these major macroeconomic issues can be known a priori, but I have confidence in the math behind how the RRP and TGA balances will change over time,” he says, underscoring that the surging crypto and stock markets since late 2022 align with the massive drain in the RRP. Hayes concludes by suggesting that, historically, markets often provide significant selling opportunities in the first quarter. By springtime, investors might want to take profits and “chill on the beach” while waiting for improved liquidity conditions to re-emerge in the second half of the year. “Right on schedule, just like almost every other year, it will be time to sell in the late stages of the first quarter,” Hayes concludes.

After a period of bullish gains, market dynamics and profit-taking impact its upward movement. This pullback signals a pause in the bullish trend, with traders and investors watching for signs of recovery or further decline. The $209.9 support zone is crucial for Solana, as its ability to hold will likely determine the next price movement. A successful defense could spark renewed buying interest and lead to a rally, while a breach of this support may trigger deeper corrections, impacting market sentiment.  A Pullback To $209.9 In Sight For Solana Bears have taken control after the pullback at $223, overpowering the bulls and driving the price toward the critical $209.9 support level. This shift in market sentiment reflects growing selling pressure, with bears looking to push the price even lower. Bulls’ failure to maintain prices above $223 has raised concerns about the strength of the current uptrend. Related Reading: Solana Price Will Complete 1,800% Surge To $4,000 With This Formation: Analyst With the $209.9 support level now in focus, the market is at a critical juncture. If the price fails to hold at this level, it may signal a lengthy correction. On the other hand, if the bulls manage to defend the support and regain control, the market might stabilize and set the stage for another rally. The battle between the bulls and bears is now centered on this support zone, and the next price action will likely reveal the direction in which the asset is headed. Traders should remain vigilant as the outcome of this test could have significant implications for the short-term price movement. Additionally, technical indicators suggest that the rally may be losing steam, with a slight bearish divergence appearing on the RSI and a slowdown in buying pressure. A retracement to $209.9 is likely to provide the market with an opportunity to reset, offering bulls a chance to consolidate and prepare for a possible rebound. Evaluating Crucial Support And Resistance Zones For Price Direction Evaluating the key support and resistance zones is essential for predicting the future direction of the price movement. In this case, the $209.9, $194, and $164 support levels are critical to watch. Related Reading: Solana Back Above Weekly & Monthly Support Levels – Analyst Expects New ATH Should the price decline, these levels may act as strong cushions, potentially preventing more drops. If the price fails to hold at $209.9, the next support level to watch is $194, followed by $164, which might signal a deeper correction. Meanwhile, the $240 and $260 levels stand as critical resistance zones once the bulls manage to regain control at $209.9. A breakout above the $240 resistance is set to trigger a notable surge, possibly driving the price toward the $260 resistance. These levels serve as key barriers, and a successful break above them could indicate an extended upsurge, signaling continued strength.

According to technical analysis by crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), Dogecoin is currently locked in a battle with a key resistance level defined by the macro 0.5 Fibonacci extension, which could determine whether the price can break through to higher levels above $0.4 or face renewed selling pressure. Moment Of Truth At Macro 0.5 Fibonacci Extension Resistance The Fibonacci extension indicator is a popular tool among technical analysts to identify price targets and resistance levels. In the case of Dogecoin, crypto analyst Kevin made use of this Fibonacci extension projected from the cryptocurrency’s low of around $0.15 in the middle of October. For Dogecoin, the macro 0.5 Fib extension represents a significant barrier that has held back upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent   This 0.5 Fib extension is also notable, considering that it is situated around an order block during Dogecoin’s most recent correction. Crypto analyst Kevin highlighted this resistance level as a “moment of truth,” emphasizing that a successful breach of this level is critical for DOGE to aim for the macro golden pocket.  Considering recent market dynamics, Dogecoin’s ability to overcome this resistance will likely hinge on broader market movements, particularly on Bitcoin’s performance. #Dogecoin is in an all out battle with the macro 0.5 Fib extension. This is big resistance and is the key to make it back up to the macro golden pocket. #DOGE success here is going to fully depend on #BTC ability to breakout of its macro golden pocket. Moment of truth folks. pic.twitter.com/vWtfpVahv1 — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) January 6, 2025 Bitcoin’s Role in Dogecoin’s Price Momentum Bitcoin, as the dominant cryptocurrency, mostly always sets the tone for the broader market, including other large market-cap altcoins like Dogecoin. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s inflows and its latest break above the $100,000 price level again in the past 24 hours have flowed into other cryptocurrencies.  Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? Kevin noted this correlation between Dogecoin and Bitcoin, highlighting that Dogecoin’s movement into its macro golden pocket will depend on Bitcoin’s ability to break out of its own macro golden pocket. If Bitcoin manages to break out of its golden pocket, it could provide the momentum needed for Dogecoin to conquer its 0.5 Fibonacci resistance. However, a failure by Bitcoin could leave Dogecoin vulnerable to further consolidation or even another retracement downwards. The golden pocket refers to a specific range within the Fibonacci extension levels, typically the area between the 0.618 and 0.65 Fib extension levels. When referred to as a macro golden pocket, it indicates that the Fibonacci indicator is being applied to a larger time frame, such as weekly or monthly charts, and is on long-term price movements. In an earlier analysis, Kevin identified $0.49 as the “macro golden pocket.” Furthermore, he noted that this level is the first major resistance zone that Dogecoin bulls must push above for a bullish breakout. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.39, up by 25.5% in the past seven days. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Whether SUI will continue the trend and hit $6 remains the question in the minds of most traders and investors.

There is no question that the news on SUI has positive sentiments, though one should recall the crypto market volatility. Corrections due to abrupt shifts in conditions or sentiment might appear at any moment.

Strong technicals point to a likely upward direction for SUI. If it breaks through $5.67, the altcoin could hit $6.

Martinez highlighted that the SuperTrend indicator, applied to the 12-hour chart of XRP/USDT, has flipped to a bullish orientation—a pattern that preceded a meteoric 470% price surge the last time. “The last time the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish on the 12-hour chart, XRP went up 470%… It just flipped bullish again,” Martinez wrote via X and shared the below chart. What This Means For XRP Price The SuperTrend indicator is a popular trend-following technical analysis tool developed by Olivier Seban. It overlays on price charts and helps traders identify the prevailing market trend by adjusting dynamically based on volatility. The indicator primarily utilizes the Average True Range (ATR) to determine its position relative to price movements, providing clear buy and sell signals. Related Reading: Key Indicator Signals Buy On XRP 4-Hour Chart – Analyst Predicts A Price Rebound The SuperTrend is calculated using the ATR and a multiplier (commonly set to 3). It plots a line above or below the price, switching its position when price crosses these levels. A bullish flip occurs when the indicator moves below the price, signaling a potential uptrend. Conversely, a bearish flip happens when it moves above the price, indicating a possible downtrend. Martinez referenced the last instance where the SuperTrend indicator flipped to bullish on XRP’s 12-hour chart, subsequently leading to a staggering 470% price increase. The last bullish flip occurred in November last year, where XRP was trading at approximately $0.50. Following the flip, XRP entered a robust uptrend, breaking through key resistance levels and reaching a peak of $2.90 on December 3, representing a 470% gain from its pre-flip valuation. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? As per Martinez, the SuperTrend indicator on the 12-hour chart has again flipped to bullish. This resurgence suggests a potential repetition of the previous explosive upward movement. Notably, the bullish SuperTrend aligns with a bullish chart setup in the weekly chart. Last week, XRP bounced off the crucial support at $1.96, and is now eying a weekly close above the 1.272 Fibonacci extension level at $2.42. A decisive break above this resistance, coupled with sustained volume, could propel the price towards the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $3.00. Based on the historical precedent, if XRP mirrors the previous pattern, the price target could be much higher. A 470% increase would target a price level of approximately $13.80.

In 2025, meme coins are stealing the show once again! Much of this is down to Donald Trump winning the US elections and acting as a catalyst for the entire crypto space. ‘2025 is here and the Trump bull market is real,’ said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, which is a local crypto firm in the US. Further proof that 2025 could be the year for crypto is the fact that Bitcoin is back over $100K, which is a really big deal because where Bitcoin goes, meme coins are likely to follow.

As a token holder, you receive exclusive trading insights and alpha trading calls. Investors also benefit from strategies used by professional traders to make informed decisions. This community-driven initiative, supported by the ‘WEPE army,’ fosters collaboration among retail investors. $WEPE, with its mission to redistribute power in the crypto segment, is positioned as a potential 100x coin for 2025. Check out our price prediction for $WEPE for 2025–2030. Its presale structure further encourages early adoption with incentives, which makes it a top contender in the meme coin market. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Layer-2 Token Offers Fast and Reliable Transactions Solaxy ($SOLX) is another popular meme coin that’s set to deliver massive returns in 2025. Its hype and utility make it a top pick among crypto investors. Solaxy was built as a Layer-2 solution on the Solana network. This meme coin tackles persistent issues like spam transactions, network congestion, and scalability. It also makes decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions faster and smoother. Solaxy has raised over $9M since its presale launch in December 2024. Plus, the current token price of $0.001594 is an attractive entry point for early investors. The project has already locked up 2.9B tokens in staking rewards, which demonstrates extensive participation and community trust. What’s more, Solaxy’s strategic tokenomics also sets it apart. Its allocations include 25% rewards, 30% development, and 10% liquidity pools. Along with seamless integrations with DeFi and zero downtime, it’s poised for exponential growth in 2025. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) – Community-Driven Approach with a 307% Staking APY The bird-themed meme coin, Flockerz ($FLOCK) stands out with its innovative Vote-to-Earn (V2E) mechanism. This is a new project that gives token holders the power to vote on key decisions. For instance, you may vote on issues like listings on exchanges, participating in rewards programs, and new ecosystem additions. $FLOCK has recorded a resounding success during its presale phase, raising over $9M since its launch in September 2024. With two weeks remaining in the presale (each token is priced at $0.0066351), this is possibly the last chance for you to get in early and potentially set yourself up for handsome gains. The impressive 300% staking APY is also attracting investors. Currently, 586M $FLOCK tokens are locked in staking rewards. $FLOCK offers a vibrant NFT ecosystem where users can mint, trade, and collect digital birds. Simply put, it provides token holders with a gamified Metaverse experience. Thanks to its strong community support and security audits, analysts expect $FLOCK to deliver substantial returns in the first quarter of 2025. 4. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Token Streamlines Digital Asset Management Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has carved out a unique niche for itself in the crypto world, seeing as it’s the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet, which is a non-custodial crypto wallet designed to facilitate seamless buying, selling, and swapping of cryptocurrencies. $BEST is leading the next-gen crypto wallet industry thanks to a slew of features that threaten the very existence of older-generation wallets. With reduced transaction fees and governance rights for holders, it’s projected to capture over 40% of the non-custodial wallet market by 2026. Naturally, $BEST is positioned for significant growth in 2025. After a successful $1M private round, $BEST’s presale was launched in November 2024. It has already raised an impressive $6.6M. Currently priced at $0.0235 per token, prices increase in less than 14 hours from now. 5. Pepe From Squid World ($PESW) – Experience the Squid Game Madness Pepe From Squid World ($PESW) is a Metaverse project created for fun (as is apparent from its theme), which takes from the vastly popular Netflix show Squid Games. So, if you’re a fan of the show, this meme coin could be right up your alley. However, do note that $PESW’s heavy-meme nature might make it more volatile. $PESW allows users to create their own Pepe characters that they can use to participate in Squid Game-inspired challenges and win exciting rewards. Others can simply enjoy the games as VIP spectators. The token is currently in stage 14 of its presale (there will be a total of 60 stages) and has managed to raise just over $80K so far. It’s currently priced at $0.00081, but will increase to $0.00085 per token come the next stage. 6. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – Leverages AI to Create Smarter and More Secure Blockchains Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is another unique crypto project that leverages AI to enhance decentralized exchanges. Using technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI), consensus mechanism, and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), this project will help create smarter and more secure blockchains. The token is currently in stage 11 of its presale and has managed to raise over $9.7M so far. Each token is currently available at $0.004875. This will increase to $0.00525 in the next presale phase, so try and get in as early as possible. After the presale ends, there’ll be a small period of volatility, following which the token price should stabilize and aim for higher price points. With a potential meme coin bull run in 2025, $LCAI could ride the bullish waves to higher highs. 7. YourTrump ($YTP) – Up to 100% Returns Thanks to Donald Trump’s X Follower Count YourTrump ($YTP) is an ICO project that determines the price of the token based on the last five digits of Donald Trump’s follower count on X, which is currently at 97,028,322. This unique approach does a great job of piquing investors’ interest, which is great for a community-focused token. For the same reason (and to improve liquidity), the developers have allocated 50% of the total token supply to the presale. $YTP is currently in presale, which will last for 60 days and comes in four stages. At the time of writing, the token is in round 3, with ten days left for round 4. Each round will have a different bonus rate, which will decrease in subsequent rounds. In the first round, the bonus rate was 10%, and the last round’s bonus rate will depend on the presale’s performance.  Each token is currently worth $0.0284. Since the price is based on Trump’s followers, it’s hard to estimate the price for the next round. However, the official presale website has mentioned the estimated listing price of the token: $2.8322. So, if you get in right now, you could potentially make around a 100% return. Are Meme Coins Resurging in 2025? As we head into 2025, crypto presales are proving their potential and resilience as they brace up for massive returns. $WEPE, $SOLX, $FLOCK, and $BEST stand out as the top contenders, reflecting the interest among investors beyond just hype. However, it’s important to do your own research. The best way to invest your money into crypto and other risky asset classes is by doing your due diligence.",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market",2025-01-07 15:00:36+00:00,"Crypto analyst Tony Severino has revealed that the Bitcoin Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) has turned red after reaching $102,000. He further explained what this development means for the flagship crypto in relation to the ongoing bull market.  Bitcoin’s Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000 In an X post, Severino revealed that the Bitcoin weekly PPO just turned red after reaching $102,000. The analyst had mentioned before that when the weekly PPO turns red, the end is near for Bitcoin’s bull run. He warned back then that this indicator could be pointing to the top soon. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? As to how this market top could happen now, the crypto analyst explained that the Bitcoin price will keep running once the red ticks begin, and the market will have topped before the red tick runs out.  Severino also highlighted the TD Sequential as another indicator that suggests the Bitcoin peak could occur as soon as the first or second quarter of this year. He noted that BTCUSD’s quarterly candlesticks are on an 8-count. The analyst further revealed that a perfected TD9 count ended the 2017 bull run.  Therefore, if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could top by July. However, the analyst still believes that the top could happen as early as Q1, noting that it isn’t uncommon for this peak to happen on the 8th candlestick in the sequence. He also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin bull market extending beyond Q2, stating that the TD8/9 setups could fail.  However, Severino added that it seems unlikely that Bitcoin will continue trending higher for multiple quarters without a more significant correction. The crypto analyst also previously predicted that the Bitcoin price could top below $150,000 as early as January 20. He explained that Donald Trump’s inauguration could be the new paradigm leading to this cyclical peak. He made this prediction based on the fact that the market could have already priced into Trump’s pro-crypto moves.  Bitcoin Price Correction Nearing Its End In the meantime, crypto analysts have suggested that the Bitcoin downtrend may be nearing its end, especially with the flagship crypto back above $100,000. In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto mentioned that a Bitcoin mark-up is imminent. This came as he remarked that the 7-week consolidation for BTC might be nearing its end.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also suggested that Bitcoin has flipped bullish once again. He remarked that the bears were no longer in control following Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000, invalidating the bearish setup. With the flagship crypto back above this price level, the crypto analyst predicted it may be ready for a sustainable rally to a cycle top.  At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $101,677, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Shiba Inu Builds Momentum: ‘Monster’ Price Move Coming—Analyst,2025-01-07 13:30:31+00:00,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) appears to be laying the groundwork for a big rally, as market observers focus on a potential vertical surge. The popular meme coin, which has often piqued investor interest, appears to be set for a “monster” climb toward $0.000066651. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Positive Trends Amid Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu’s current pricing behavior indicates a steady rebound in momentum. After weeks of sluggish activity, the token’s upward trend has fueled confidence. Analysts are keeping a careful eye on important technical signs that indicate SHIB may be ready to exit its consolidation phase. Increased trade volumes and strengthened support levels indicate that investor confidence is growing. Positive mood in the broader crypto landscape supports CoinMarketCap data indicating the coin is gaining more traction. Major developments in Bitcoin and Ethereum have set off a chain reaction that has elevated the appeal of SHIB and other cryptocurrencies. On X, an analyst identified as “Strong” noted a likely cup-and-handle formation in SHIB’s weekly chart that suggested possible consolidation before to an upward breakthrough. Based on past resistance levels, they estimated a post-breakout goal of $0.000066 suggesting great optimistic possibilities. $SHIB Shib will do what it does, “slowly then all at once” a monster vertical move HTF chart looks super bullish: – a catch up play to $DOGE – largest erc token on $ETH – soon a break out of a 4y down trend A bullish $SHIB is good for risk on crypto It’s almost time pic.twitter.com/ofzM4fEXhr — $trong (@StrongHedge) January 5, 2025 Emphasizing SHIB’s ranking as the biggest ERC-20 token on Ethereum, the research also positioned SHIB as a “catch-up play” for Dogecoin. Furthermore, SHIB is apparently approaching a breakout from a four-year declining trend, which supports its attraction to traders expecting a substantial price increase. Technical Signs Point To A Breakthrough The likelihood that Shiba Inu will achieve its estimated goal of $0.000066 is determined in part by technical and commercial variables. While the coin has been trading in a long-term symmetrical triangle, it is typically associated with potential bullish breakouts. Prominent experts and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts on social media have emphasized this circumstance as a motivating factor for SHIB’s upcoming actions. Recent studies underlined the need of maintaining important resistance values. Should SHIB keep following its current rising path, holders could find big increases in the next weeks. Moreover, the introduction of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 solution, has piqued attention on the general value of the ecosystem. Related Reading: Bitcoin Target Locked: Metaplanet Eyes 10,000 BTC This Year Market Mood Improves Shiba Inu Projection Beyond mere technical concerns, the prevailing attitude in the crypto space supports SHIB’s promise. Social engagement metrics have climbed; Shiba Inu mentions on websites like Twitter have peaked several months ago. Furthermore, increased speculation about important events in the ecosystem, such as new coin listings and partnerships, has kept the token in the spotlight. However, analysts warn against being overly optimistic. Shiba Inu price swings, like those of any other speculative asset, are characterized by volatility. Investors should approach this rise with a balanced mindset and keep an eye out for market changes. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000002414, up slightly in the last 24 hours. Whether it can meet its ambitious $0.000066651 aim is determined by a combination of technical and market variables. Featured image from DogTime, chart from TradingView",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Exchange Supply Breaks Equilibrium: Whales Scoop Up 240,000 BTC",2025-01-07 12:00:52+00:00,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory, which had been stuck in consolidation earlier, has finally started following a new trajectory. Bitcoin Spot Exchange Supply Has Seen A Sharp Plunge Recently In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the trend in the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory. This metric keeps track of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized spot exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps 20%, But Social Media Still Bearish: Green Signal For Rally? This part of the exchange supply refers to the actual tokens of the asset that exist on the blockchain. The exchange supply that doesn’t actually involve users to own BTC, as is the case with derivatives products, is known as “paper BTC.” When the spot exchange inventory rises, it means the investors are depositing a net number of coins into the wallets associated with these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders might transfer their BTC to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the exchange outflows are outweighing the exchange inflows. Investors usually take their coins off into self-custody when they plan to hold into the long-term, so this kind of trend can be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory saw a large plunge around the time of the FTX collapse back in November 2022. This suggests a large movement of coins occurred out of these platforms as the asset’s bear market reached its bottom. Following this plummet, the indicator started a phase of consolidation that lasted for the entirety of 2023 and most of 2024. The trend finally broke in the last couple of months of 2024, when the metric registered a sharp crash. These outflows came alongside Bitcoin’s exploration of new all-time highs, implying the accumulation from the investors might have played a role in the run. In total, 240,000 BTC exited the exchange-related wallets during this plunge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase Woo has pointed out that Microstrategy’s buying in this period summed up to about 192,000 BTC, which means there are other whales present in the market taking significant amounts off the exchanges. So far, the downtrend in the spot exchange inventory has shown no signs of reaching a bottom, as outflows have continued into 2025. If investors indeed keep up the accumulation in the near future as well, then Bitcoin could benefit from some further bullish momentum. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recovery in a sharp fashion during the last 24 hours as its price has broken back above the $101,700 mark.

Reddit,solana,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-07 13:22:55,"Hey fam, happy new year. This was popular on r/Solidity, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT:*** *The deadline to apply was just extended from to January 11th!*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

LMK if you have any questions, the team or I can try to give more info.",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
Reddit,solana,Had to use all my Solana funds to pay a vet bill,2025-01-07 22:26:53,"My Dog (16 months) has been biting at his backside and back legs for the last almost two weeks. For a while it just looked like he was chasing his tail so I didn't think much of it but over time he was doing it more and more and then he would start chewing on his back legs while whining so I ended up to him to the vet and it turns out he had parasites (most likely from eating something off the ground outside)

The bill ended up being almost $300 and my work always slows down to a crawl in the beginning months of the year so I had to use whatever I had in my solana chain which was around $200 to help cover the cost. I'm happy I was able to get my dog the help he needed but I'm also devastated that my crypto is gone.

This is my first time getting into crypto and this setback just makes me think that this isn't for me. Has anyone else struggled from not using their crypto so it can actually grow? And if so how did you come back from losing it all?",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
Reddit,solana,Solana's SIMD-215 Proposal: A Major Step Toward Blockchain Scalability and Quantum Resistance,2025-01-07 16:19:23,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my thoughts on an exciting development I came across in the blockchain space: Solana's SIMD-215 proposal. This update aims to solve some of the most significant challenges in blockchain scalability.

At its core, SIMD-215 introduces Solana's Accounts Lattice Hash system, which addresses inefficient account state updates. By using homomorphic hashing, the network only updates what’s changed, instead of recalculating the entire state from scratch. This approach allows for:

Improved efficiency 👍

The ability to support billions of accounts 😳

Enhanced security, with 128-bit encryption and quantum resistance

What stands out to me is not only how Solana is solving current scalability issues, but also how it's preparing for future threats, like quantum computing. This could be a game-changer in making blockchain networks more secure and scalable for widespread adoption.

What do you all think about this approach? Do you believe scalability is the key to blockchain reaching mainstream adoption, or are there other factors at play?

Would love to hear your thoughts! 🙌🙌",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

They aren’t the same address sending the small amounts either. Why is this happening like I haven’t lost any money but like this kind of sketchy. Should I transfer it to a brand new wallet or download a new one like what do I do to make my money safe? Is it the actual Salona coin that is corrupted like what’s going on?

Reddit,solana,Rust (Now Go) Trading Platform from Scratch - Update 3,2025-01-07 19:12:57,"The second update:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust\_trading\_platform\_from\_scratch\_update\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust_trading_platform_from_scratch_update_2/)

Moving these posts over to here instead of r/algotrading  because I think there are some folks here who could benefit from it.

I've been building an algotrading and fraud detection/chain analysis system in Rust for the last several months. Despite loving Rust, I immediately started running into some significant issues with the language and this application.

**the issues**

Rust is very good. It's very fast, incredibly memory efficient, and has lots of libraries required to build onchain. Solana is built on it, obviously.

The issue that Rust has is working with unstructured data, or data whose structure is pretty difficult to define. I wanted to build out a custom parser for transactions, and the going was incredibly slow and painful. Between parsing bytes and converting them to different data types to dealing with weird memory footguns, it became so annoying to write that I genuinely left the project alone for a week or two.

Everyone on r/algotrading was recommending Golang. I'd written some serverless lambda applications in Golang, and really liked it. It's like taking the ease of use of Python and adding the speed and power of Rust or C. Yes, it's garbage collected and therefore probably a wee bit slower than Rust, but the difference was basically ""not finish a very fast solution in Rust"" or ""finish a fairly fast solution in Golang"" and I've seen how dumb a lot of ya'll are, I'm not going to need breakneck speed to win in this market and do a lot of the analytical work I'm trying to do. I also have a vision of a system where Golang does all the data fetching and structuring and Rust does all of the data analytics, but that's long down the road.

**golang rules**

I started the Golang conversion yesterday, and I'm already close to achieving relative parity with my Rust codebase. I also get to use Raylib for data visualization, which seems to be much more mature than Bevy, the game engine I was using in Rust.

**lesson: dev speed isn't just about how quickly you can get something out there**

The dev speed in Rust was so bad that I literally found myself not wanting to work on the project. I spent ages just figuring out how to make the memory management work instead of adding features. I still believe Rust is a fantastic language, but I don't think I'm going to go back to it for projects that require a lot of unstructured data parsing. I just develop better software, faster, using Go right now.

**the overall plan**

I'm going to get the basics of wallet visualization and management working first and then work on the trading engine. I've got a shared RPC node with a ton of available bandwidth, so I've got a lot of leeway to test and gather data with.

After that, I'm going to build out the data vis layer at the same time as the trading engine. I think it'll be helpful to be able to visualize other wallets and their strategies while I develop my own, and I have a few wallets I want to look into.",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
Reddit,solana,"""createIdempotent"" initial deposit not refunded",2025-01-07 13:05:20,"I am reaching out to request assistance with a transaction issue that occurred on the Solana blockchain. Recently, I engaged in a transaction involving the purchase of a memecoin, which resulted in an unexpected outcome. While the initial account creation and deposit were successful, the deposit was not refunded to me as expected during the sell transaction. Although I received the token funds, the deposit refund was not processed.

I have conducted a thorough review of the transaction data on Solscan and Sol Explorer, which confirms that the deposit was successful. However, the subsequent transfer and close token account actions did not occur as expected for this specific token account.

I would like to emphasize that my primary concern is not the monetary value involved, but rather the opportunity to identify and address any potential issues in the transaction process. I believe that collaborating with your team will help improve the overall user experience and ensure the integrity of the Solana blockchain.

To facilitate a thorough investigation, I would appreciate guidance on how to formally log a ticket with the solana bc support team, providing all necessary details and transaction data. Please let me know what information is required to get this reviewed

Reddit,solana,Want to know how I've already made over 100k this year?,2025-01-06 00:44:01,"
I'm feeling generous with a secret.
 
Go through and check out new coins being made on Dexscreener. Search the creator wallets until you find rug factory wallets. Then,  hit up SolanaFM, enter their wallet address and watch them transfer profits to a bew address. Follow the new one, you'll see them make a new coin and you can get the CA minutes before its posted on Dex. SolanaFM shows the token name and CA before it migrates to Dexscreener which gives you time to enter the CA into your your market and spam the buy till your order goes through. 

This has given me the chance at being the first buyer many many times.  I buy around 2 to 20 sol worth, then sell before the rug factory dump.The factoey usually follows a pattern of when they dump. The last one was at 60% market cap OR immediate rug (yep, still risk involved). Typically 3 out of 10 new coins they create will autosell at creation.

The times they dont, I sell at 40k or 50k marketcap as this factory trended at 60k. The profits are better than you'll believe, especially at 20 sol buy in. 

 
Once they rug, I watch that wallet send their profits to a new wallet and then start a new coin and I do it all over again.

Ever wondered how tokens work on the Solana blockchain? What does a “create token account” transaction mean?

https://preview.redd.it/nj77i7j1mgbe1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5c450c74be676992742c1c1438a82288d852ec

Unlike some other blockchains, Solana uses a special system called “associated token accounts” to handle tokens efficiently and securely. Let’s break it down in a way that’s easy to understand, with examples you can relate to!

# What Is an Associated Token Account (ATA)?

Imagine you’ve got a locker at school. Each locker is labeled with your name and can only store one type of item — say books, snacks, or gym clothes. On Solana, an associated token account is like your personal locker for a specific token. It’s tied to your wallet (your unique ID) and can only hold one kind of token, like USDC or Bonk or Pengu.

This setup keeps everything organized and easy to find. It also ensures that tokens are stored safely in the right place.

# Why Do You Need an ATA?

Here’s the deal: before you can use a token — whether to buy something, trade, or receive an airdrop — you need a specific locker (an ATA) for that token. Without it, you’d have nowhere to store the token! Let’s look at some reasons why this is important:

1. **Organization:** Everyone’s tokens are stored in their own lockers, so it’s clear who owns what.
2. **Compatibility:** Apps and games on Solana know where to look for your tokens because ATAs follow a standard design.
3. **Simplicity:** You don’t need to manually manage different accounts. The system does it for you!

# How Do You Create an ATA?

Typically, ATAs are created automatically as a part of a buy or transfer transaction. All wallets, trading platforms, and bots handle this for you.

However, sometimes users might want to create an ATA in a separate transaction:

1. This can make your buy or transfer transaction “smaller,” which increases the chances of it being processed faster — especially during times of high network traffic.
2. On the flip side, some spammers take advantage of this system by creating lots of unnecessary ATA transactions trying to trick other people into buying their tokens.

Associated token accounts might sound complicated at first, but they’re really just a clever way to keep track of tokens on Solana. Think of them as your personal lockers — safe, organized, and ready for anything. Whether you’re playing games, trading, or just holding tokens, ATAs make it all work smoothly.

So next time you hear about “create associated token account” transactions, you’ll know it’s just Solana setting up a locker for your tokens. Easy, right? Now go out there and explore the world of Solana!",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

# Introduction

*“We knew smaller, faster, cheaper better than anybody else in the world, and now we're applying those concepts to blockchain.” — Greg Fitzgerald, Solana co-founder*

Solana is a high-performance, low-latency blockchain renowned for its speed, efficiency, and focus on user experience. Its unique integrated architecture enables thousands of transactions per second across a globally decentralized network. With a block time of 400 milliseconds and transaction fees that are fractions of a cent, it delivers on both speed and cost-effectiveness. This report delves into the intricacies of Solana's design and operation, exploring the key mechanisms and network topology that contribute to its capabilities.

Solana takes an integrated approach to blockchain development, leveraging the founding team's decades of experience in building distributed systems. One of Solana's core principles is that software should never get in the way of hardware. This means that software exploits whatever hardware it runs on to the fullest and scales with it. As a unified ecosystem, all applications built on top of this single blockchain inherit composability, enabling them to interact and build upon each other seamlessly. This architecture also ensures a straightforward and intuitive user experience without the need for bridging, separate chain IDs, or liquidity fragmentation.

Solana is evolving rapidly, with recent developments including SVM rollups and [ZK Compression](https://www.zkcompression.com/) as important scaling solutions. While these projects may one day shape our future perception of Solana, they are currently in the very early stages of development or adoption and will not be covered in this report.

# Transaction Lifecycle

Our primary lens for understanding Solana throughout this report will be the lifecycle of a typical transaction. To construct a basic model for understanding Solana transactions, we can outline the process as follows: 

https://preview.redd.it/y27ncoggogbe1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f24f7d74ee34e53e7e15ad616c291587de0885b

* Users initiate transactions, all of which are sent to the current lead block producer (known as the leader). The leader compiles these transactions into a block, executing them and thereby updating their local state.
* This block of transactions is then propagated throughout the network for other validators to execute and confirm.

The subsequent sections of this report will expand this model and delve into this process in much greater detail, beginning with the key participants—the users.

# Remember

*Substantial changes to the core Solana protocol go through a formal, transparent* [*process*](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md) *of submitting a Solana Improvement Document (SIMD) which community members and core engineering will publicly critique. SIMDs are then voted on by the network.*

# Six stages

https://preview.redd.it/bb6i7wxjogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d445455affd3993d91da00bf732ea4c01128a7

We will reference the six-stage visual shown above throughout this report, as it offers us a consistent framework for understanding the relationships between Solana's core elements.

Earlier chapters are arranged according to these six stages. The final chapters—Gossip, Archive, Economics, and Jito—tie up any loose ends. It’s important to note that some chapters will span multiple stages, and some stages will appear in multiple chapters.

This overlap is unavoidable because the six-stage framework has its limitations. In reality, Solana is a complex distributed system with many interdependent elements.

# Users

*“Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto” — Raj Gokal, Solana co-founder*

A user's journey typically begins by setting up and funding a wallet application. Multiple popular wallet applications are available for Solana, either as native mobile applications or browser extensions.

Wallets cryptographically generate user keypairs, consisting of public and private keys. The public key acts as the unique identifier for their account and is known by all participants in the network. A user’s account on Solana can be considered a data structure that holds information and state related to their interactions with the Solana blockchain. In this way, a public key is similar to a filename: just as a filename uniquely identifies a file within a file system, a Solana public key uniquely identifies an account on the Solana blockchain. Public keys on Solana are represented as 32-byte Base58-encoded strings.

`FDKJvWcJNe6wecbgDYDFPCfgs14aJnVsUfWQRYWLn4Tn`

A private key — also known as a secret key —can be considered as the password or access key that grants permission to access and modify the account. Signing with private keys is how blockchains handle authorization. Knowledge of the private key gives absolute authority over the account. Solana private keys are also 32-bytes in length. Keypairs are the 64-byte combinations of public (first half) and private (second half) keys. Examples:

`3j15jr41S9KmdfughusutvvqBjAeEDbU5sDQp8EbwQ3Hify2pfM1hiEsuFFAVq8bwGywnZpswrbDzPENbBZbd5nj`

`[63,107,47,255,141,135,58,142,191,245,78,18,90,162,107,197,8,33,211,15,228,235,250,30,185,122,105,23,147,115,115,86,8,155,67,155,110,51,117,0,19,150,143,217,132,205,122,91,167,61,6,246,107,39,51,110,185,81,13,81,16,182,30,71]`

Private keys can also be derived from mnemonic seed phrases, usually 12 or 24 words long. This format is often used in wallets for easier backup and recovery. Multiple keys can be derived deterministically from a single seed phrase.

Solana utilizes [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519), a widely used elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, for its public-key cryptography needs. Ed25519 is favored for its small key size, small signature size, fast computation, and immunity to many common attacks. Each Solana wallet address represents a point on the Ed25519 elliptic curve.

https://preview.redd.it/astjuuasogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7094772d293060d90b5e9e70e2d4c65a13fe3a

The user signs transactions with their private key. This signature is included with the transaction data and can be verified by other participants using the sender's public key. This process ensures the transaction has not been tampered with and is authorized by the owner of the corresponding private key. The signature also acts as a unique identifier for the transaction.

# Solana Transactions

Sending a transaction is the only way to mutate state on Solana. Any write operation is performed through a transaction, and transactions are atomic—either everything the transaction attempts to do happens or the transaction fails. A transaction, more formally known as a ""transaction message,"" comprises four sections: a header, a list of account addresses, a recent blockhash, and instructions.

https://preview.redd.it/yl7lvpouogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5349733808055e00bf0a209ed2174abd529619d7

* Header: The header contains references to the account address list, indicating which accounts must sign the transaction.
* Account Addresses: This list includes all the accounts that will be read from or written to during the transaction. Building such a list for every transaction is a requirement unique to Solana and can be challenging for developers. However, knowing in advance which pieces of state a transaction will interact with enables optimizations not possible on many other blockchains.
* Recent Blockhash: This is used to prevent duplicate and stale transactions. A recent blockhash expires after 150 blocks (about 1 minute). By default, RPCs attempt to forward transactions every 2 seconds until the transaction is either finalized or the recent blockhash expires, at which point the transaction is dropped.
* Instructions: These form the core part of the transaction. Each instruction represents a specific operation (e.g., transfer, mint, burn, create account, close account). Each instruction specifies the program to execute, the accounts required, and the data needed for the instruction's execution.

The number of instructions in a transaction is limited first by its size, which can be up to 1,232 bytes. There are also limits around the number of accounts that can be referenced. Lastly, there are limits to a transaction’s complexity measured in compute units (CUs). CUs quantify the computational resources expended in processing transactions.

# Remember

*The smallest unit of SOL is known as a ""lamport,"" equivalent to one billionth of a SOL, similar to a satoshi in Bitcoin. The lamport is named after* [*Leslie Lamport*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)*, a computer scientist and mathematician whose research established many theoretical foundations of modern distributed systems.*

The cost in SOL to execute a transaction is separated into 2 parts - a base fee and a prioritization fee. The base fee is a fixed 5000 lamports per signature cost irrespective of the transaction’s complexity—usually, there is 1 signature per transaction.

Prioritization fees are technically optional, but during periods of high demand for blockspace become necessary. These fees are priced in micro-lamports (millionth of a lamport) per compute unit. Their purpose is to act as a price signal, making transactions more economically compelling for validator nodes to include in their blocks. 

`total fee = prioritization fee + base fee`

`prioritization fee = compute unit price (micro-lamports) x compute unit limit`

Currently, 50% of all transaction-related fees are burnt, permanently removing this SOL from circulation with the remaining 50% going to the block producer. A new change (SIMD 96) is soon to be introduced allowing for 100% of prioritization fees to go to the block producer. Base fees remain unchanged.

# Sending transactions

https://preview.redd.it/ciea7ftyogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0407e01298915f6b4310da6b5271465500f8be7d

A user connects their wallet to the application, allowing the app to read the user’s public key. The private key remains encrypted and securely sandboxed in a separate environment from the application.

The application builds the transaction message parameters based on the user’s interactions. For example, if a user wanted to swap two tokens, they would specify the amount of tokens to buy, the corresponding tokens to sell, and an acceptable transaction slippage.

‍Once the transaction message is ready, it is sent to the wallet to be signed with the user’s private key. At this point, the user is prompted with a popup to confirm their willingness to transact. This popup may include a simulation of the transaction’s results. Once signed, the transaction message and the signature are returned to the app, which can then forward the transaction to an RPC provider of their choice, either their own or by using the wallet’s provider.

‍RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers act as intermediaries between applications and the validators that build blocks. They are an essential service that enables applications to [submit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/cd6f931223181d5a1d47cba64e857785a175a760/rpc/src/rpc.rs#L3396) or simulate signed transactions and efficiently retrieve on-chain data. Applications that wish to interact with the network do so via a JSON-RPC or a WebSocket endpoint ([docs](https://solana.com/docs/rpc)).

# Remember

*The term “failed transaction” on Solana is misleading and has caused considerable confusion. These transactions incur fees and are executed successfully by the runtime exactly as the signer intended. They “fail” due to the transaction’s own logic requiring them to do so. +80% of “failed” transactions come from error code 0x1771, the code for exceeding slippage amount (*[*data*](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/zapokorny/q/18zuYlugBdcm/solana-failed-txs-by-program)*). Notably, 95% of these transactions are submitted by only 0.1% of active Solana addresses, primarily automated bots attempting to take advantage of time-sensitive price arbitrage opportunities.*

# Gulf Stream

*“Literally the goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world — so speed of light through fiber. Who we’re competing with is NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) refer to RPC nodes. These nodes can be thought of as gateways to interact with and read data from the network. They run the same software as full validators but with different settings, allowing them to accurately simulate transactions and maintain an up-to-date view of the current state. As of this writing, there are over 4,000 RPC nodes on the Solana network.

‍Unlike full validator nodes, RPC nodes do not hold any stake in the network. Without stake, they cannot vote or build blocks. This setup differs from most other blockchains, where the validator and RPC nodes are typically the same. Since RPC nodes do not receive staking rewards, the economics of running RPC nodes are distinct from those of validators with many operating as a paid service for developers running Solana applications.

‍Solana stands out because it was designed from the outset to operate without a mempool. Unlike traditional blockchains that use gossip protocols to randomly and broadly propagate transactions across the network, Solana forwards all transactions to a predetermined lead validator, known as the leader, for each slot.

https://preview.redd.it/efimg7g5pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ddc929f7c96b3eb528f3d8768388853e1c62db

# Callout

*Solana operates four clusters: Localnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet-Beta. When people refer to Solana or the Solana network, they almost always refer to Mainnet-Beta. Mainnet-Beta is the only cluster where tokens hold real value, while the other clusters are used solely for testing purposes.*

‍Once an RPC receives a transaction message to be included in a block, it must be forwarded to the leader. A leader schedule is produced before every epoch (approximately every two days). The upcoming epoch is divided into slots, each fixed at 400 milliseconds, and a leader is chosen for each slot. Validators with a higher stake will be chosen more often to become leader within each epoch. During each slot, transaction messages are forwarded to the leader, who has the opportunity to produce a block. When it is a validator’s turn, they switch to ""leader mode,"" begin actively processing transactions and broadcasting blocks to the rest of the network.

# ‍Stake-Weighted Quality of Service - SWQoS

‍In early 2024, Solana introduced a new mechanism aimed at preventing spam and enhancing Sybil resistance, known as ""Stake-Weighted Quality of Service"" (SWQoS). This system enables leaders to prioritize transaction messages that are proxied through other staked validators. Here, validators with a higher stake are granted a proportionally higher capacity to transmit transaction message packets to the leader. This approach effectively mitigates Sybil attacks from non-staked nodes across the network.

https://preview.redd.it/gacy1qn8pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e510254be8f3dfe4465bb02297771ec19e98024

Under this model, validators can also engage in agreements to lease their stake-weighted capacity to RPC nodes. In return, RPC nodes gain increased bandwidth, allowing them to achieve greater transaction inclusion rates in blocks. Notably, 80% of a leader’s capacity (2,000 connections) is reserved for SWQoS. The remaining 20% (500 connections) is allocated for transaction messages from non-staked nodes. This allocation strategy mirrors priority lanes on highways, where drivers pay a toll to avoid traffic.

‍SWQoS has impacted the Solana ecosystem by raising the requirements to forward transactions to the leader and reducing the effectiveness of spam attacks. The change has incentivized high-traffic applications to vertically integrate their operations. By running their own validator nodes, or by having access to staked connections, applications can ensure privileged access to the leader, thereby enhancing their transaction processing capabilities.

# ‍A QUIC Note

‍In late 2022, Solana adopted the [QUIC networking protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to manage transaction message transmission to the leader. This transition was prompted by network disruptions caused by bots spamming on-chain NFT mints. QUIC facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication.

Initially developed by [Google](https://research.google/pubs/the-quic-transport-protocol-design-and-internet-scale-deployment/) in 2012, QUIC attempts to offer the best of both worlds. It facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication similar to UDP, but with the secure sessions and advanced flow control strategies of TCP. This allows for limits to be placed on individual sources of traffic so that the network can focus on processing genuine transactions. It also has a concept of separate streams; so if one transaction is dropped, it doesn’t need to block the remaining ones. In short, QUIC can be thought of as attempting to combine the best characteristics of TCP and UDP.

# ‍Callout box

*Stake-weighting is a recurring principle found throughout Solana's systems, encompassing voting rewards, turbine trees, leader schedules, Gulf Stream, and the gossip network. Validators with greater stake are accorded higher trust and prioritized roles in the network.*

# ‍Block Building

*“We consider SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) the best in terms of virtual machine technology currently.” — Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation*

Many blockchain networks construct entire blocks before broadcasting them, known as discrete block building. Solana, in contrast, employs continuous block building which involves assembling and streaming blocks dynamically as they are created during an allocated time slot, significantly reducing latency.

‍Each slot lasts 400 milliseconds, and each leader is assigned four consecutive slots (1.6 seconds) before rotation to the next leader. For a block to gain acceptance, all transactions within it must be valid and reproducible by other nodes.

‍Two slots before assuming leadership, a validator halts transaction forwarding to prepare for its upcoming workload. During this interval, inbound traffic spikes, reaching over a gigabyte per second as the entire network directs packets to the incoming leader.

‍Upon receipt, transaction messages enter the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), the validator's core logic responsible for block production. Here, the transaction processing sequence begins with the Fetch Stage, where transactions are received via QUIC. Subsequently, transactions progress to the SigVerify Stage, undergoing rigorous validation checks. Here the validator verifies the validity of signatures, checks for the correct number of signatures, and eliminates duplicate transactions.

# Banking Stage

The banking stage can be described as the block-building stage. It is the most important stage of the TPU, which gets its name from the “bank“. A bank is just the state at a given block. For every block, Solana has a bank that is used to access state at that block. When a block becomes finalized after enough validators vote on it, they will flush account updates from the bank to disk, making them permanent. The final state of the chain is the result of all confirmed transactions. This state can always be recreated from the blockchain history deterministically.

‍Transactions are processed in parallel and packaged into ledger “entries,” which are batches of 64 non-conflicting transactions. Parallel transaction processing on Solana is made easy because each transaction must include a complete list of all the accounts it will read and write to. This design choice places a burden on developers but allows the validator to avoid race conditions by easily selecting only non-conflicting transactions for execution within each entry. Transactions conflict if they both attempt to write to the same account (two writes) or if one attempts to read from and the other writes to the same account (read + write). Thus conflicting transactions go into different entries and are executed sequentially, while non-conflicting transactions are executed in parallel.

‍There are six threads processing transactions in parallel, with four dedicated to normal transactions and two exclusively handling vote transactions which are integral to Solana’s consensus mechanism. All parallelization of processing is achieved through multiple CPU cores; validators have no GPU requirements ([docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements)).

‍Once transactions have been grouped into entries, they are ready to be executed by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The accounts necessary for the transaction are locked; checks are run to confirm the transaction is recent but hasn’t already been processed. The accounts are loaded, and the transaction logic is executed, updating the account states. A hash of the entry will be sent to the Proof of History service to be recorded (more on this in the next section). If the recording process is successful, all changes will be committed to the bank, and the locks on each account placed in the first step are lifted. Execution is done by the SVM, a virtual machine built using the Solana fork of [rBPF](https://docs.rs/solana_rbpf/latest/solana_rbpf/), a library for working with JIT compilation, and virtual machines for eBPF programs. Note Solana does not mandate how validators choose to order transactions within a block. This flexibility is a crucial point that we will return to later in the Economics + Jito section of this report.

# ‍Remember

*The term SVM can be ambiguous, as it may refer to either the ""Solana Virtual Machine"" or the ""Sealevel Virtual Machine."" Both terms describe the same concept, with Sealevel being the name of Solana's runtime environment. The term SVM continues to be loosely thrown around despite recent efforts to precisely* [*define its boundaries*](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/anzas-new-svm-api)*.*

# ‍Clients

‍Solana is a network comprising thousands of independently operated nodes collaborating to maintain a single unified ledger. Each node constitutes a high-performance machine running the same open-source software known as a “client”.

‍Solana launched with a single validator client software — originally the Solana Labs client, now known as the [Agave client ](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave)— written in Rust. Expanding client diversity has been a priority ever since and one that will truly come to fruition with the launch of the [Firedancer client](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer). Firedancer is a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language. Built by an experienced team from high-frequency trading firm Jump, it promises to be the most performant validator client on any blockchain.

# Proof of History

*“I had two coffees and a beer, and I was up until 4:00 AM. I had this eureka moment that puzzle \[sic\] similar to proof of work using the same SHA-256 preimage-resistant hash function… I knew that I had this arrow of time.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Proof of History (PoH) is Solana's secret sauce, functioning like a special clock in every validator that facilitates synchronization across the network. PoH establishes a reliable source of truth for the order of events and the passage of time. Most critically it ensures adherence to the leader schedule. Despite similar names, Proof of History is not a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work.

https://preview.redd.it/5m9vzdnppgbe1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b68f99530f62595829ba76bdf159cb127f2940

Communication overhead between nodes typically increases as networks expand, and coordination becomes increasingly complicated. Solana mitigates this by replacing node-to-node communication with a PoH local computation. This means validators can commit to a block with just a single round of voting. Trusted timestamps in messages ensure that validators cannot step over each other and start their blocks prematurely.

Underlying PoH are the unique properties of hashing algorithms, specifically [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2):

* **Deterministic:** The same input will always produce the same hash.
* **Fixed Size:** Regardless of input size, the output hash is always 256 bits.
* **Efficient:** It is fast to compute the hash for any given input.
* [**Preimage Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack)**:** Finding the original input from the hash output is computationally infeasible.
* **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input (even a single bit) results in a significantly different hash, a property known as the avalanche effect.
* [**Collision Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance)**:** It is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

Within each validator client, a dedicated ""Proof of History service"" continually runs the SHA256 hash algorithm creating a chain of hashes. Each hash’s input is the previous hash's output. This chain acts the same as a verifiable delay function, given that the hashing work must be done in sequence and the results of future hashes cannot be known ahead of time. If the PoH service creates a chain of a thousand hashes, we know time has passed for it to have calculated each hash sequentially — this can be thought of as a “micro proof of work.” Yet, other validators can verify the correctness of the thousand hashes in parallel at a much faster rate than they were produced since the input and output of each hash have been broadcast to the network. Therefore, PoH is difficult to produce but easy to verify.

The range of performance in computing SHA-256 across different CPUs is surprisingly narrow, with only small differences among the fastest machines. A common upper limit has already been reached, despite significant time and effort being invested in optimizing this function, largely due to Bitcoin's reliance on it.

https://preview.redd.it/p1t6rq7rpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddadf711c11df6317b747e41a541200de8fb6eab

During a leader’s slot, the PoH service will receive newly processed entries from the banking stage. The current PoH hash plus a hash of all transactions in the entry are combined into the next PoH hash. This serves as a timestamp that inserts the entry into the chain of hashes, proving the sequence in which transactions were processed. This process not only confirms the passage of time but also serves as a cryptographic record of the transactions.

In a single block, there are 800,000 hashes. The PoH stream also includes ""ticks,"" which are empty entries indicating the leader's liveness and the passage of time approximating a small fraction of a second. A tick occurs every 6.25 milliseconds, resulting in 64 ticks per block and a total block time of 400 milliseconds.

Validators continually run the PoH clock even when they are not the leader as it plays a pivotal role in the process of synchronization between nodes.

# Remember

*The key benefit of PoH is that it ensures the correct leader schedule must be adhered to, even if a block producer is offline — a state known as being “delinquent”. PoH prevents a malicious validator from producing blocks before their turn.*

# Accounts Model

*“Separating code and state in SVM was the best design decision. Blessed are the embedded system devs that religiously drilled this concept into my brain.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Within a Solana validator, the global state is maintained in the accounts database known as AccountsDB. This database is responsible for storing all accounts, both in memory and on disk. The primary data structure in the account index is a hashmap, making AccountsDB essentially a vast [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database). Here, the key is the account address, and the value is the account data.

‍Over time the number of Solana accounts has surged into the hundreds of millions. This large number is partly because, as Solana developers are fond of saying, ""Everything on Solana is an account!""

https://preview.redd.it/od9jdizvpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad934df81448f583fc49d29e7306cef5a4dc505

# Solana accounts

‍An account is a container that persistently holds data, similar to a file on a computer. They come in various forms:

‍User accounts: These accounts have a private key and are typically generated by a wallet software for a user.

* Data accounts: These accounts store state information, such as the number of a specific token a user holds.
* Program accounts: These are larger accounts that contain executable bytecode, somewhat equivalent to a .exe file on Windows or a .app file on Mac.
* Native program accounts: These are special pre-deployed program accounts that perform various core functionalities of the network. [Examples](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/programs) include the Vote Program and the BPF Loader.

‍All accounts have the following fields:

https://preview.redd.it/ek1vnit0qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c085da69525391de492cb3eb50db8d3fea40a330

# Programs

Solana program accounts contain only executable logic. This means when a program is run it mutates the state of other accounts but remains unchanged itself. This separation of code and state differentiates Solana from other blockchains and supports many of its optimizations. Developers primarily write these programs in Rust, a general-purpose programming language [known](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf) for its strong focus on safety and performance. Additionally, multiple SDKs in [TypeScript](https://www.helius.dev/blog/build-solana-programs-with-typescript-poseidon) and Python are available to facilitate the creation of application front-ends and enable programmatic interaction with the network.

‍Many common functionalities are provided out-of-the-box by native programs. For example, Solana does not require developers to deploy code to create a token. Instead, instructions are sent to a pre-deployed native program that will set up an account to store the token’s metadata, effectively creating a new token.

# ‍Rent

‍Rent is a mechanism designed to incentivize users to close accounts and reduce state bloat. To create a new account, a minimum balance of SOL, known as the ""rent-exempt"" amount, must be held by the account. This can be considered a storage cost incurred to keep the account alive in a validator's memory. If the size of the account's data increases, the minimum balance rent requirement increases proportionally. When an account is no longer needed, it can be closed, and the rent is returned to the account owner. 

‍For example, if a user holds a dollar-denominated stablecoin, this state is stored in a token account. Currently, the rent-exempt amount for a token account is 0.002 SOL. If the user transfers their entire stablecoin balance to a friend, the token account can be closed, and the user will receive back their 0.002 SOL. Programs often handle account closures automatically for users. Several applications are available to help users clean up old, unused accounts and reclaim the small amounts of SOL stored in them.

# ‍Ownership

‍While reading account data is universally permitted, Solana's ownership model enhances security by restricting exactly who can modify (write) an account's data. This concept is crucial for enforcing rules and permissions on the Solana blockchain. Every account has a program ""owner"". The owner of an account is responsible for governing it, ensuring that only authorized programs can change the account's data. A notable exception to this rule is the transfer of lamports (the smallest unit of SOL)—increasing an account's lamports balance is universally permitted, regardless of ownership.

# ‍Storage of State

‍Solana programs, being read-only executable files, must store state using “Program Derived Addresses” (PDAs). PDAs are special types of accounts associated with and owned by a program rather than a specific user. While normal Solana user addresses are derived from the public key of an Ed25519 key pair, PDAs do not have a private key. Instead, their public key is derived from a combination of parameters—often keywords or other account addresses—along with the program ID (address) of the owning program.

‍PDA addresses exist ""off-curve,"" meaning they are not on the Ed25519 curve like normal addresses. Only the program that owns the PDA can programmatically generate signatures for it, ensuring that it’s the only one that can modify the PDA's state.

https://preview.redd.it/82dag167qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5e5694b996bf17c3928282a7cf37dfb104b75e

Above: Solana token accounts are specific examples of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). They are used to hold tokens and live “off-curve.” The Associated Token Account (ATA) program ensures that each wallet can only have one associated token account for each token type, providing a standardized way to manage token accounts.

# ‍Turbine

*“The most interesting part about Solana is not parallelization, the SVM, or Toly's tweets. It is something you probably haven't heard of: Turbine.” — Mert Mumtaz, Helius*

During the banking stage, transactions are organized into entries and sent to the Proof of History stream for timestamping. The block's bank is updated, and the entries are now ready for the next phase—Turbine.

Turbine is the process through which the leader propagates their block to the rest of the network. Inspired by [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), it is designed to be fast and efficient, reducing communication overhead and minimizing the amount of data a leader needs to send.

https://preview.redd.it/t9ijgbvaqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c0ee8a717f6c145ad661e1855ec49a38917e9f

Turbine achieves this by breaking down transaction data into ""shreds'' through a process called ""shredding."" Shreds are small packets of data, up to 1280 bytes, similar to individual frames in a video stream. When reassembled, these shreds allow validators to replay the entire block. The shreds are sent over the internet between validators using UDP and utilize erasure coding to handle packet loss or malicious dropping of packets. [Erasure coding](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/reedsolomon/reed_solomon_codes.html#), a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)\-based error detection and correction scheme, ensures data integrity. Even if some shreds are lost, the block can still be reconstructed.

Shreds are grouped into batches known as forward error correction (FEC) batches. By default, these batches consist of 64 shreds (32 data shreds + 32 recovery shreds). Data recovery occurs per FEC batch, meaning that up to half the packets in a batch can be lost or corrupted, and all the data can still be recovered. Each 64 shred batch is merkelized with the root being signed by the leader, and chained to the previous batch. This process ensures that shreds can be securely obtained from any node in the network that possesses them, as the chain of Merkle roots provides a verifiable path of authenticity and integrity.

The leader initially broadcasts to a single root node, which disseminates the shreds to all other validator nodes. This root node changes with each shred. Validators are organized into layers, forming the ""Turbine Tree."" Validators with a larger stake amount are typically positioned toward the top of the tree, while those with lower stakes are placed toward the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/3mflwjhcqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50409eac7cb3e07884ed130f632c95b3590541ba

The tree usually spans two or three hops, depending on the number of active validators. For visual simplicity, a fanout of 3 is depicted above, but Solana’s actual fanout value is currently set to 200. For security reasons, the order of the tree is rotated for each new batch of shreds.

The primary goal of such a system is to alleviate the outbound data egress pressure on the leader and root nodes. By utilizing a system of transmit and retransmit, the load is distributed between the leader and the retransmitters, reducing the strain on any single node.

# Consensus

*“Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana… I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive” — Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder*

Once a validator receives a new block from the leader via Turbine, it must validate all transactions within each entry. This involves replaying the entire block, validating the PoH hashes in parallel, recreating the transactions in the sequence dictated by PoH, and updating its local bank. 

[**https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png**](https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png)

This process is handled by the Transaction Validation Unit (TVU), which is analogous to the leader’s Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), serving as the core logic responsible for processing shreds and block validation. Like the TPU, the TVU flow is broken down into several stages, starting with the Shred Fetch Stage where shreds are received over Turbine. In the subsequent Shred Verify Leader Signature Stage, the shreds undergo multiple sanity checks, most notably the verification of the leader’s signature, which ensures that the received shreds originated from the leader. 

‍In the Retransmit Stage, the validator, based on its location in the Turbine tree, forwards the shreds to the appropriate downstream validators. In the Replay Stage, the validator recreates each transaction exactly and in the correct order while updating its local version of the bank.

‍The Replay Stage is analogous to the banking stage in the TPU; it is the most important stage and can be more directly described as the block validation stage. Replay is a single-threaded process loop that orchestrates many key operations, including voting, resetting the PoH clock, and switching banks.

Reddit,solana,I’ve done my own research ,2025-01-05 12:18:47,"Update: I am truly thankful to everyone who took the time to read my story, share advice, and offer kind words. I deeply appreciate your understanding and lack of judgment. My lack of experience, naive nature, and a dream led me to this point. 
When you ignore life’s alarms, it will only make them louder until you wake up. I am awake now. But I will sleep well tonight! Thank you all!

I’m not asking for help I just want to share my story.

I’m a hardworking mother of two, juggling work, studies, and life, doing everything I can to make it all work. Like many, I came to crypto with a dream- a dream of making good money to give my kids the childhood I never had.
But instead, I lost it all. I got rugged multiple times, poured countless sleepless nights into communities, and chased the promise of a better life. Looking back, I realize that chasing that dream cost me the very life I was trying to build for my kids. If I could go back, I’d put everything I had into paying off my loan and living a simple, carefree life.

Now, I’m back to where I started - living paycheck to paycheck and facing the reality of paying off that loan for the next ten years. Memecoins didn’t just take my money, they took time - time I can never get back with my family. All I can do now is hug my kids and leave this nightmare behind.

I did my own research, but it came at a heavy price.
To everyone still in the space, I wish you luck and mooning coins, but please, be careful.",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

The protocol is operating illegally in many countries, including the US and Canada. This includes in unauthorised offering of financial services and products in the US, Canada and many more nations. The Save team conceals the unlawful nature of its operations from users. For example, users who ask if the project is operating in accordance with the law on Save's discord will be met with vague answers, and then ridiculed, before being 'muted' or banned. 

The first step in obtaining justice for the victims of Save is filing criminal complaints against the founder of Rooter, so that he can be criminally charged. Rooter is not only a criminal but also a coward and refuses to identify himself. 

Save fails to pay taxes in any jurisdiction and therefore its crimes must also be brought to the attention of the IRS and CRA. However, since Rooter conceals the address of Save, there is no way to serve them legal notice.

The Solana Winternitz Vault is optional, meaning Solana users will need to choose to store their funds in the Winternitz vaults to be quantum-proof.

https://preview.redd.it/gg4ex0nst6be1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=efdc8a8977741b523d8e242268c43b4713cabf38

Solana developers have created a quantum-resistant vault on the Solana blockchain to protect user funds from potential threats posed by quantum computers.

The “Solana Winternitz Vault” solution achieves this by implementing a complex hash-based signature system that generates new keys every time a transaction is made, [explained ](https://github.com/deanmlittle/solana-winternitz-vault)cryptography researcher and Zeus Network chief scientist Dean Little in a Jan. 3 GitHub post.

Generating new private keys for each transaction should make it more difficult for [quantum computers](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-vs-quantum-computing-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-cryptocurrencies) to plan a coordinated attack on any given set of public keys, which are exposed each time a transaction is signed.

https://preview.redd.it/cypqygput6be1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=8494999794a376244bd5342448274b18424a518f

*Source:* [*Dean Little*](https://x.com/deanmlittle/status/1875136565456109891)

The Solana quantum-resistant feature is currently available as an optional addition, not a network-wide security upgrade. This means that Solana users must choose to store their funds in the Winternitz vaults, rather than their regular Solana wallets, to ensure their assets are protected against potential [quantum threats.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zero-knowledge-proofs-quantum-proof-ethereum-xin-xin-fan)

# How it works

The Winternitz vault first generates a new Winternitz keypair and computes the Keccak256 Merkle root of the public key.

A “split” vault consisting of a split and refund account is then created, where the user generates a Winternitz signature over a message containing the amount of “lamports” — the smallest denomination of the native cryptocurrency Solana — that they want to transfer.

Once the transfer is completed, any remaining funds are transferred to the refund account and the vault is closed.

***Related:*** [***Don't be afraid of quantum computers***](https://cointelegraph.com/news/i-m-not-afraid-of-quantum-computers)

The development could offer a degree of reassurance to many crypto investors who fear their cryptographically secured funds could one day be wiped out by an overpowering quantum computer.

Little seemingly poked fun at Bitcoin investor and commentator Fred Krueger, by sharing [screenshots](https://x.com/deanmlittle/status/1875252002160308634) from a Dec. 19 X post in which Krueger said Solana would be the “first casualty” of quantum.

Part of [Ethereum’s technical roadmap](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-the-splurge-advanced-cryptography-plan-for-quantum-computers) includes implementing quantum-resistant solutions — however, one of Ethereum’s founders, Vitalik Buterin, is confident that quantum won’t [pose any real threat](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-bitcoin-encryption-keys) for at least a decade.

“Even if ‘real’ quantum computers come soon, the day when regular people have quantum computers on their laptops or phones may well be decades after the day when powerful institutions get one that can crack elliptic curve cryptography,” Buterin said in October.

Reddit,solana,Telegram Hack [Awareness Post],2025-01-04 21:05:51,"I'm writing this to give awareness on how my Solana telegram account was hacked.

It all started from one of my token from GMGN (same applies to Dexscreener). As I review the graph as I usually do, I decided to visit again its X account to check for any news. Unfortunately, the X link has been changed to a malicious X account and I did not notice this. On the malicious X account was a post that news and discussion about the project will be discussed on the telegram group so I joined the tg group as I normally would.

During the joining process, there's the usual verify if your human popup from Safeguard to prevent bots from joining. I clicked this and everything looks normal, except for an extra step that I have to scan a QR code. I don't recall doing this with other tg group but it seems like a normal 2FA checking so I scanned it. And that's where I fucked up.

At first, nothing is happening, it only looks like the QR that i'm scanning is not working, so I kept on scanning it and trying to align the camera and lighting to get it right. Then I noticed something on my active chats, my Solana Trojan Bot, which I haven't used in a long time had a chat notification. I checked the message and it sent me my private key. I was wondering why, and read that the message requesting it came from me just seconds ago.

Right it that moment, I realized what happened and I triggered a logout on all devices from the tg app on my phone. Then a ""Token-Admin"" started chatting me, saying they can see that I that I'm having some problems joining the group. I blocked this person, and another one sent me a message. Told them to fuck off and they stopped, and left all tg groups.

I was lucky that my solana tg trading bot doesn't have any funds as I stopped using it long ago. So I removed it from the wallets, and moved all other funds to new wallets, just to be sure.

Posting this to share awareness that it's so easy to get hacked nowadays. You could be doing something you normally do multiple times a day, and still get hacked. Always double check everything on every step, and for the love of god, don't scan any QR code on telegram.

Reddit,solana,"Solcard: My experience, and perspective! 💳",2025-01-04 01:05:34,"Hey Guys,

My experience:

I just wanted to share my experience with Solcard. It was the first time that I used Solcard (a decentralized debit/credit card on Solana ecosystem) and it worked! 

I was skeptical in the beginning because I was involved very early and thought it was just another meme coin. I thought it could be another rug pull or scam but I eventually decided to take a chance and give it a shot.

I ordered something small off Amazon to test it out and the transaction went through and arrived at my door step that same week.

My thoughts: 

As of 2017, approximately 1.7 billion adults worldwide were unbanked, meaning they did not have access to a bank account.  This represented about 31% of the global adult population at that time.

Regarding mobile phone ownership among the unbanked, data from 2013 indicated that nearly 70% of unbanked individuals owned a mobile phone.

I think this could solve major problems for certain parts of the world. And came to the realization how much it already does through conversations with people in the community

Thank you ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept 3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

Reddit,ethereum,"""Vitalik Buterin Deserves a Nobel Prize in Economics for His Work on Crypto and Ethereum."": Bankless Co-Founder Ryan Sean Adams",2025-01-03 14:32:32,"In a tweet Ryan Sean Adams - co-founder of Bankless - said that Vitalik Buterin should be recognized with a Nobel prize in economics for his contributions to Ethereum and the entire crypto space. He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

I’m attempting to run an ethereum node on Evernode (evernode.org) by deploying the Docker version ethereum/ethereum:latest.

So far, I haven’t had any success. I suspect the issue might be related to the port configuration required for the node to communicate with the outside world. Do you have any tips or guidance?

You might be wondering why I chose Evernode for this. The idea of running a blockchain participation node on a platform powered by another blockchain (Evernode) is fascinating, and the pricing is incredibly low compared to other VPS options.

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

Please ask any questions you may have!  We have our next public goods funding round beginning January 11th.  To learn more about Octant, join our discord: [https://discord.com/invite/octant](https://discord.com/invite/octant) ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
Reddit,ethereum,Calculating network fee,2025-01-03 10:06:41,"Can anyone please tell me how to reliably calculate the network fee at any given time?

Reddit,ethereum,The Next Upgrade and Global Adoption 2025,2025-01-02 05:29:45,"##**Tech and upgrades coming in 2025**

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

Reddit,ethereum,How to Start Research on Ethereum as a Beginner?,2025-01-01 14:03:35,"I’m a developer, just getting into this space. While I’ve worked on development, I’ve never done formal research in crypto before. I want to expand my knowledge and better understand the ecosystem from a research perspective.

Could you share some advice or resources for someone with development experience to get started with crypto research? I’m particularly interested in:

* Researching Ethereum protocols, scalability solutions, or DeFi.
* Understanding key academic or technical papers in this field.
* Tools, frameworks, or platforms commonly used in crypto research.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
Reddit,ethereum,"Transfer went wrong, please help me",2025-01-02 10:32:35,"I did 2 money transfers from Gatehub wallet to Revolut wallet. Regarding BTC, I pushed « receive » on Revolut and it gave me a BTC wallet address, which I copy pasted after pushing « transfer BTC » on Gatehub.

I did the exact same thing for Eth.

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

I am no crypto expert, can anyone here help me  find my money ?

Ps : wrote to revolut, they said they don’t know where is the money, and that they are looking

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

Please help

EDIT : Turns out Gatehub sent BTC and ETH on XRP network which is not managed by Revolut. But they still found a way to recover the funds !! So money is safe for now 🤙🏼

Thank you to all the people who tried to help. 🙏🏻

Cheers to all the scammers who tried to make me log my wallets into your dark web apps. 🙋🏻‍♂️",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

I’m just getting started with learning about smart contracts, and honestly, I’m pretty excited (and a little overwhelmed). Ethereum has always fascinated me, and I finally decided it’s time to stop just reading about it and actually start building something.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,ethereum,Those living in Canada: Do you save up in USDC?,2024-12-28 18:33:37,"Hi!

With the decline of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, are you considering creating your emergency fund in USD?
For sure, you can open an USD account in a traditional bank but do you also consider buying USDC (or other tokens)?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to have a discussion regarding **how relevant (or nor) is it to save up in USDC for a Canadian.** I know a lot of Canadians are already investing in USD anyway.
**Does saving up directly on a USD stablecoin make any sense?**


How I see it:

**Advantages**
- less fees (maybe not, I really don't know what are the fees for a USD account opened in Canada)
- easy to buy 

**Disadvantages**
- **taxes implications?** If you pay your transaction fees in ETH, technically you may have to pay taxes on it (depending on your ACB). Plus, since ERC-20 tokens are considered assets in Canada, you should pay taxes if you make a gain when you spend your USDC (*if USD(C)/CAD goes up in value across time, which is the current consensus*)
- **not easy to spend USD** outside of Crypto space (but crypto cards are democratizing)",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to run a state only node ?,2024-12-28 12:11:33,"Hey,

I'm not really sure how different Ethereum is from Bitcoin in client logic. From my understanding, there are transactions and state (smart contract values, etc...).

In my case, I need to access the read-only features of some smart contracts without spending too much on hardware. 

My current solution was to use an rpc provider, request the state of contract x, then listen for new blocks and update the state on my end based on the transactions received. This is necessary to avoid hitting rate limits, as my usage uses a large number of requests.

The problem is that the ""sync"" part can take days with the current rate limit because I'm using contract calls, which probably isn't the best solution. So I wanted to know if it was possible to run a node without the whole blockchain, just with the state, the goal is not to verify transactions but to know more efficiently the state of specific contracts.

Do you know if this is possible? if not, is it difficult to create my own implementation to request this directly on the network like real nodes do, and include my logic instead?

A kind of ethereum client that  sync only a specific part of the state and does not store or verify transactions",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
Reddit,ethereum,Can somebody explain how people are still paying $23 or over that for gas fees in the second half of 2024?,2024-12-27 17:18:42,"Hi. I was just following an ETH thread in the cryptocurrency subreddit and various people are claiming they are paying about $30 or even more than that for their gas fees for L1 transactions.

For example, [I saw this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hm4k11/comment/m3tigd0/
):

> Yeah I try to swap $45 worth of ETH for a coin I want and it's costing me $23 gas fees. No thanks. 

I have read other comments in the past few weeks of people still paying something like upper $20 range for gas fees, and I assume their transactions were recently?

How is this possible though?  Checking the gas fee chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#1y, the highest average gas fee in the last 6 months was $14 USD on November 13th.  The gas fee has generally been lower than that in the last 6 months for Ethereum.

I haven't seen any average gas fee over $20 USD since March of 2024 according to that chart.  So how are people still paying like $23, or even in the upper $20 range for their gas fees lately?",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,ethereum,Beginner confused about networks,2024-12-26 11:16:47,"Hi all, 

I’m fairly new to crypto and find the networks quite overwhelming. 

I can choose from Ethereum (ERC20), Optimism, Arbitrum One, or Base network. 

Unfortunately I do not know the difference between these - all I know, is I don’t want to pay the exorbitant fees from the ERC20 network. 

Can I just randomly choose the same low fee network on my sending and receiving end, or is there a process to using other networks, e.g., buying supporting coins for a transaction? 

I also noticed the differing networks have their own amount of eth storage. If you send eth using a specific network, it’ll stay on that network forever? You can never combine all your eth? 

Are there any negatives of using different networks to avoid exorbitant fees?

As you can see, I’m quite confused, any help would be much appreciated!!

Thanks ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](http://cryptache.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Bitcoin-Standard-The-Decentralized-Alternative-to-Central-Banking-PDF-Room.pdf)

MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Earning bitcoin

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

It seems like many of you believe Bitcoin operates in its own universe, unaffected by broader economic trends. Yields have been rising, JOLTS came in higher than expected today, and we’ve already seen how Bitcoin reacts to these shifts. While I’m still bullish in the long run, we can’t ignore short-term issues like inflation and the Fed’s rate policies. There’s a lot of money currently parked in bonds, and it doesn’t seem like that cash will flow into riskier assets anytime soon. I’m curious to know, what could the next bear market look like if rates stay high for an extended period and then start to ease again?

Another option would be for me to buy a cold storage wallet , set it up and he can send it to the wallet from binance for now until I can bring him the wallet. 

He does not have a lot of money so it won’t be a big amount.

Reddit,bitcoin,Cheapest place to buy Bitcoin? Exchanges or those BTC ATMs? ,2025-01-07 22:48:26,"Hey all,

I'm a longtime hodler, I've bought on Robinhood, Coinbase (Pro), and Binance.US before they dropped USD deposits. In my experience, Binance had the lowest fees historically. Now, everything is more expensive. Coinbase Pro used to be significantly cheaper than regular Coinbase for the same amount of purchase. Now, the difference between Coinbase Pro and regular Coinbase is basically negligible. 

Example: buying $1,800 worth of BTC on Coinbase Pro right now costs $23, while on regular Coinbase, it's a $33 fee. Back in the day, it'd be like $7 Coinbase Pro vs. $25 regular Coinbase. 

Is there a place that's cheaper that you're aware of? How are those random BTC ATMs? And how do they work? I imagine they’re not any cheaper and might even be more expensive, no? ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
Reddit,bitcoin,Devils advocate: Bitcoin end game and widened wealth inequality ,2025-01-07 06:40:33,"Look I’m a bitcoin advocate. I think it’s a great tool to save money and negate the loss of dollar purchasing power. It’s the S&P500 on steroids, where the biggest holders will continue to generate insane amounts of wealth , borrow against it while the rest scramble for crumbs or are forced to sell to pay for living expenses. I’m happy to be in on it, happy for those here avoiding loss of purchase power, just concerned for the general concept of a sped up wealth gap generator and its effects on society long term. Bitcoin and the stock market are a scary indicator that the western world economic dominance is facing a problem, which owning some shares/coins will help mitigate, but it’s worrisome to think what it means in a macroeconomic environment. 

The death of efficient wealth redistribution by governments which are no longer capable of doing so continues to drive a gap between the haves and have nots. I’m worried bitcoin will just be abused as a way to further that gap (see MSTR money printing/bitcoin buying hack). What’s the end game look like for the 90%? ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,bitcoin,Buying Bitcoin is cheaper for americans.,2025-01-06 17:16:51,"Americans don't realize how much money they spare just by buying Bitcoin in american dollar.

Let me give you a example:
Most of us buy Bitcoin through a Exchange.
When you buy Bitcoin there, there is a fee for buying, and there is a fee for sending to your hot/cold wallet.

If a American earns $1.200 per month, and buy $200 dollars in BTC, the fee for sending it to the hot/cold wallet is minimum. Something like 20 - 50 dollars?

I'm not a American citizen, that means that my currency is worth less than the U.S dollar. (Currently being US$ 1,00 = R$ 6,00 my currency is Real, Brazil).

That means that if I want to buy or send my BTC to my wallet, it is multiplied by 6. Which is currently R$120 - R$150.

By the way, I make R$1,600 per month, so R$150 is roughly 10% of my salary.

It's extremely difficult to stack even 1 cent (0.01) of Bitcoin.

So Americans, or Europeans of this sub, enjoy your strong economy and buy sats, because here in the third world, where I live and I'm currently fighting for a better life, it's hard to stack Bitcoin safely.

Yesterday I was send some BTC from one wallet to another on Sparrow. I set the fee a bit higher than what showed on the mempool; but the blocks were taking a long time... up to 30 minutes... and during that time fees rose, and I got bumped back in the pool. So I increase the fee once; and again fees rose and I got bumped back. Went to inrease fee again when I noticed that the ""pay to"" (receive address) was not the same as the original one. I then worried because I hadn't checked this address on the first RBF; and thought I might have sent my BTC to a wrong address. I looked at ""cancel transaction"" but that too had a different new 'pay to' address; so I just left it alone. Eventually (a long eventually) I got 1 confirmation and could relax. Is it normal to have a new 'pay to' address when bumping up fees? Next time I'll make sure I pay enough to get into the next block.

Reddit,bitcoin,Where is the best place to buy that sends the coin to your specified address?,2025-01-07 18:18:39,"I cannot find a place that I like to purchase BTC consistently.

The first place I bought was at bitcoin.org.  Then I figured out they use moonpay.com to process the transaction.  No app, just using the website.

So the next week I used moonpay directly to purchase and it turns out it was cheaper eliminating the middleman.  Again, no app, just using their website, BTC went directly to my wallet.

I tried to make another purchase today.  However moonpay is saying I can only purchase $482 worth?  No explanation.

So I will just ask, where is the best place to buy?  I was told Strike, but it seems you have to download their app and predeposit funds?

I am just looking for a vendor that can deliver me bitcoin via a web browser.  I put in what I what, give it my BTC wallet address, it takes the money from my bank account and 20 minutes later the BTC appears in my account.  Low fees of course.  Who am I looking for?",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

What I have seen going around on Twitter recently is like, oh, your a Bitcoiner you should be running your own node and if you mine Bitcoin you should be making your own templates. Pools are too centralized look at solo mining. You get the jist.

There was another round of chatter about multi-sig wallets, 3rd party custodians, ETF's are safer than self custody etc.

**What I am trying to get at is, there is a lot in the background that does go on & I'm thinking does my Dad really need to worry about this?**

My plan is to get him used to buying some every month (kept on Strike in the app) and then I will teach him about a hardware wallet and get him to learn the ever so basic (well to us anyways) of sending Bitcoin to a Hardware Wallet.

Reddit,bitcoin,Ledger won’t sign multisig tx; says I need to ‘register account’ but won’t let me get passed this,2025-01-07 20:47:15,"I have the same issue as the user below (copy and pasted from r/ledger):

“Register Multisig (in Sparrow) Wallet on Ledger Nano

Some time ago, I established a multisig wallet on Sprrow in which one of the keystores was my ledger nano. It worked fine. And there it sat for a long time. When I went to use it recently, I got a prompt to ""Register"" my wallet. I run through the prompts but, for some reason, the device doesn't seem to accept ""approve"" when i select it. As a result, the key associated with the ledger is useless. Is there something I need to do \*before\* signing to register? If so, how? I've seen some articles talking about how ledger upgraded security regarding multisig. But, as far as I can tell, the upgrade made the device useless. Any thoughts on how to proceedd?”

Does anyone know how to fix it?

The master fingerprint is showing the same for multisig setup.

It’s almost like the ledger has forgotten its part of a multisig and I don’t think it’s possible to upload a BSMS file onto the ledger.

For some reason, the health check works perfectly, and I’ve signed a tx with multiple keys (including the ledger) before.

Any help is appreciated.

Reddit,bitcoin,Insane Question…,2025-01-07 20:19:30,"So, I enjoy buying storage units for fun sometimes. Yes, like the “storage wars” people. I bought a unit a few years back that has remained on my mind since I emptied it out- here’s why. 

The guy who had the unit (yes, unfortunately I met him because I found his dogs ashes and family photos and I always try and return personal stuff of no consequence to me, but that probably means the world to the individual who lost their unit), anyway- he was some sort of Tech Genius / Tweaker / just generally had a thing for computers and electronics and stuff. When I tell you that unit was absolutely full of the craziest tech stuff and copious amounts of things that I didn’t even know existed lol… it was wild. Well, to make a long story short- I could SWEAR that he made a comment about Bitcoin being stored on something somewhere in that unit. Ofc, at the time Bitcoin wasn’t doing anything compared to what it is today and to be honest I wasn’t really that knowledgeable at that point to begin with (so I kinda just blew it off and was like mmmhhmmm, whatever you say Methrosoft 🙄). 

Fast forward to today (not today specifically but in the past month or two), and it has been on my mind heavily. Lo and behold (and to my surprise), I still have all of the SD cards and flash drives from that unit in my possession (because I wanted to see what was on them for whatever reason so I put them up back in 2017 / 2018 and still haven’t looked at them ofc). 

My question is: how would I check to see if any bitcoin is on the SD cards and flash drives? I ofc know the chances of them not having a key are slim to none (if there’s anything at all on there), but damnit I don’t think I can handle not knowing if there’s anything on them or not! 

This dude was absolutely the type to have bought it for .08 each in 2010 just for the tech and for the hell of it- so what do I do?? How do I see what’s on these cards and drives?? TYA! ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,bitcoin,Deflation,2025-01-07 19:32:19,"I am struggling to fully understand how Bitcoin will work with deflation when the supply is fully mined.  I want to split the 2 types of deflation here
1 - deflation due to technological advances making things cheaper to produce.  This one is a no brainer for me and shows how backwards inflations targets are
2 - deflation due to the increase of population and finite supply.

With the second type of deflation is it not a valid argument that this might slow the economy due to people being insetivised to hold on to their money?  We aren't losing value to inflation but in 50 years time could goods actually be more expensive because we have not had to innovate? If you look at the tech sector it has been able to lower prices faster than inflation consistently through innovation.

Secondly does deflation not have the same problem of benefiting the wealthy, it is a shift in thinking because you are holding Bitcoin instead of having traditional assets such as real estate but those who have more will just be made more wealthy by population growth.  As those starting with nothing start to accumulate more money it will just increase the value of the currency meaning those with large pools will become more wealthy.  

Is Bitcoin intended to be used alongside fiat currency as the best asset we have and a store of value in which case we don't really gain anything unless you are in this time right now where Bitcoin is still building it's value, it will end up just be a better version of Gold? Or is it expected to replace fiat currency, in which case is deflation as mentioned above an issue?",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,bitcoin,(One of) Biggest Myth Around Bitcoin Debunked: The Fiat Powers That Be Will Just Capture It,2025-01-07 18:18:21,"**This conflates holding bitcoin with controlling it.** 

this is understandable, because in the current fiat financial system, if I am a multi billionaire, I can use the money itself to attack the centralised structure around money, the government and its treasury, by bribing those involved to change the rules to my benefit

for all intents and purposes, if I have a lot of money in our current system, I have the potential to corrupt it

bitcoin is code: you can't bribe code, you can't threaten it, you can't exile it or execute it. you can run your own code, and create your own version of Bitcoin

If you believe right now Bitcoin is not already controlled, and that someone is somehow magically creating Bitcoin ""out of thin air"" that is another topic, but if you worry about future capture by the fiat system, then no:

at best, you can buy Bitcoin, and affect the FIAT price, but Bitcoin itself is not affected: you simply exchanged Bitcoin. when you bought Bitcoin, you didn't break the network's ability to communicate among its participants using the TCP\\IP protocol. you didn't change the finite supply number. **you just received\\sent Bitcoin tokens.**

you can own 20 million bitcoin, but the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin token, and those who participate in it will be unaffected

if I have 100 billion dollars, I have many vectors of attack to take over the current system. In the Bitcoin world, I have no attack vector: I can simply participate as an equal to everyone else, and if I break the rules I get kicked out and excluded automatically

I get it, its mindblowingly new: a non coercive, non violent way of exchanging value. it sounds too good to be true but it is so ",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

*""Fake versions of gold and silver multiply; after the abduction, they are thrown into the lake; upon their rediscovery, global exhaustion and trouble. All debts are voided.""*

Reading’s interpretation, written in 2006, predates the rise of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency revolution.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,For the EIGHTH STRAIGHT YEAR: Announcing The Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment for 2025!,2025-01-07 15:37:33,"https://preview.redd.it/ste610s7clbe1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1ee5bed78d2b78254f99cd2962945d2473e2976

# The 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment Has Begun!

For the [**eighth year in a row**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/), I am happy to announce the launch of the Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment for 2025.  

For those unfamiliar with the Experiments, my annual tradition is to buy $100 of each of the Top Ten Cryptos every New Year’s Day since [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

***The Top Ten Experiments have now purchased a total of $8,000 in crypto since January 2018.***

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio includes the following cryptos, in descending order as per [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) on January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/zex7wo5cclbe1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=4818de85bafc0aff776f36ff8f3df0ee075989de

**That’s a $1000 investment on the 1st of January, 2025**, ($100 each) of #1 **BTC**, #2 **ETH**, #3 **XRP**, #5 **BNB**, #6 **SOL**, #7 **DOGE**, #8 **USDC**, #9 **ADA**, #10 **TRON**, and #11 **AVAX**.

Fun fact #1: *For the second year in a row, all 2025 coins have appeared in at least one past Top Ten Portfolio, meaning no new cryptocurrencies have joined the overall Experiment.* 

Long time Top Ten Experiment followers will notice **I’m again breaking the tradition of strictly investing in the Top Ten by market cap, no matter what.**  To stay consistent with past Experiments, I will only include one stablecoin, so #11 **AVAX** is in and #7 **USDT** is out.  I made a similar decision with the [**2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/), [**2023**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/), and [**2024 Top Ten Portfolios**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/).  

**USDC** will remain in the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio. 

So: ***The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio = Top Ten – USDT + #11 AVAX.***

Q: *Why keep a stablecoin in the portfolio at all?* 

A: Consistency.  For better or worse, I included **USDT** in the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) and one stable in every subsequent year since.  Including a stablecoin in the 2025 Top Ten is my attempt at an honest/fair comparison between each year’s portfolios.

Q: *Why were stablecoins included in the Top Ten Experiments in the first place?*  

A:  Check out the [FAQs](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/).

# Where Did You Purchase The 2025 Top Ten Crypto?

Thanks to the good work they’re doing over at [Universal](https://app.universalassets.xyz/), I barely had to leave Base this year. Details/proof of purchases below:

I used [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/) on Base for **WBTC (ahem, cbBTC)** and **WETH:**

https://preview.redd.it/ab5jmxwdclbe1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ac0ddeb2da38815e1562751ad674fb604db117

[DefiLlama](https://swap.defillama.com/) on Base for the Universal assets **uSOL, uDOGE, uADA,** and **uXRP.**

https://preview.redd.it/wv10e4jlclbe1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=43e9f1db2600d73370d7f0bb7947a6c5975388c3

Over to BNB Smart Chain’s [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) for **BNB** and **TRON**

And finally, I used [DefiLlama](https://swap.defillama.com/) to purchase **AVAX** on Avalanche :

Fun fact #2: *For the first time in Experiment history, I purchased 100% of the Top Ten on Decentralized Exchanges*

# My Homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Fund VS Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an *attempt to capture the gains of the entire cryptocurrency market.*  

No crypto indexes existed, so I created my own.

Crypto has rapidly progressed in recent years and now more and more options exist.

This year I’ll be comparing my homemade Top Ten Index to [Coinbase’s COIN50](https://www.coinbase.com/coin50), Coinbase’s benchmark crypto index, which offers “diversified exposure to 50 leading digital assets.”  Here’s the snapshot of what COIN50 was worth on 1 January 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/lpxn0y2wclbe1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=264120ef3c9e74a0ae217fc463236474e9e6e690

**Here’s the question I’ll be tracking:** as the year goes by, ***will COIN50 outperform my homemade Top Ten Index Fund?*** 

# All Systems Go!

Like every year, I’m excited to launch the latest iteration of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. If you’re new to the Experiments, welcome! If you’ve been following over the years, many thanks for sticking around. 

The first monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio will drop in early February.  Other reports from the 2018-2024 Top Ten Portfolios will be released periodically over the course of the year.

In the meantime, you’re welcome to pour through years of data [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

Happy New Year and here’s hoping for an up only 2025 (insert rocket emoji here).

That seems like it would be the most secure (even if confusing) way to go about things.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Courtyard's & Polygon's auction of a 1999 PSA 10 Charizard Pokemon card is at $260K with 2 days remaining,2025-01-07 19:49:34,"About a month ago at Art Basel, Polygon announced they had acquired a PSA 10 1st Edition Shadowless Charizard card and are auctioning it on Courtyard. 

For those who haven't heard of Courtyard, Courtyard is an RWA project.  It is a pioneering platform that integrates blockchain technology with the world of physical collectibles, particularly focusing on trading cards like those from Pokémon, sports, and other collectible categories. 

Courtyard allows users to tokenize their physical collectibles, mainly graded trading cards, into NFTs on Polygon. Users send their card to Courtyard. All physical items are stored in secure vaults provided by Brink's, ensuring that the collectibles are safe, insured, and can be redeemed at any time. Courtyard hosts a marketplace where users can buy, sell, or trade these tokenized collectibles. They also run auctions, including no-reserve auctions, where items like a PSA 10 Charizard card can be bid on. These auctions leverage the Polygon blockchain for transparency and efficiency. 

Polygon had initially acquired this card for $250,000. This is the most valuable Pokemon card - one sold for $369,000 back in 2020, and another for $420,000 in 2022. 

I may be wrong, but this may be the highest RWA auction for a collectible so far in web3.  If this is a sign of things to come in 2025, there's a lot of liquidity that is out there!

If criminals get that, then it's much easier to take over your financial accounts or other important accounts. 

Hopefully other crypto and decentralized web3 options will become available to help us retain some of our privacy so we get to manage that risk, or essentially eliminate the risk for the most part. 

Now I'm off to see if I can delete or scrub my account, probably too late though.

It's just a simple one.

  
Crypto was supposed to be people taking the power back from the government and banks, who've misused their power to control and manipulate the finances of the average Joe for centrues now.   

  
Why are people not banding to take control of a new era where people have control over the money and self-accountability for stupidity (ie: bad investment where you had to click 'ok' to buy) 

It feels like this went from encouraging a healthier mankind to now, we're about to get stuck with a big one, even worse.   People like Coinbase are already showing people they can take their money without impunity.....   I am personally scared to put money on that exchange after they held my funds twice & require you give up your privacy or they keep your money.

All tokens in circulation. 70 million are TVL in nodes that are running on the network. **At current numbers the network is yielding $20,000,000 yearly revenue for nodes and those who decided to stake their tokens.**

I'll be first to admit that I've been aware of this project for years as it is an OG project from 2017(?) or something, but it never really clicked with me for several reasons. One main factor being that utility tokens tend to require low cost for anyone to want to use them. Which has been the case here for many years hence why I wasn't as hyped as some of the people promoting this project.

Well, fast forward to this Christmas and I randomly decided to revisit this project to see how things were going. Since I first learned about this project in 2021 things seemed to move in the right direction albeit slow. Real businesses were using the technology, big names were involved in it, British Standard Institute were adamant in applying OriginTrail to everything. Looked very promising but the demand for the token was lackluster mostly due to network limits.

I'll save everyone a long read and direct you simply to the official network statistics website for OriginTrail:

[https://staking.origintrail.io/](https://staking.origintrail.io/)

The hockey stick increase that began 2 weeks ago in activity can be seen on the right chart. While Trac demand is on the left and is currently sitting at about 65-70,000 Trac per day. **This equates to $20,000,000 yearly revenue for nodes and those who decided to stake their tokens.** These tokens are being locked in nodes as payment to nodes as businesses upload data/hash it by creating something called ""knowledge assets"". All business demand, not random people or fake token lock-ups! After the upgrade to DKG v8, or Decentralized Knowledge Graph version 8, which apparently will boost 1000x increase in network capabilities a whole new dimension has opened up and is apparently in its infancy stage for global adoption.

I have personally started to stack up here, just curious why no one is paying attention? The adoption stage seem to be starting and businesses seem to be lined up to use this technology. It has basically opened up ability for any business, small or large, to build their own Knowledge Graphs, in a decentralized way.

Give me your opinions! Seems these guys have been really hard at work for 5-6 years now and things seem to be stacking up for them nicely. Token demand is directly related to businesses using the Trac token.",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

It seems to be chock-full of falsehoods.

Also, the S&P has outpaced both inflation and the monetary supply over time. Why are so many people falling for this?

How can I summarize this information into one single percentage without actually buying any coins? Since there would be equal amount of money in each coin, percentages also represent the same amount of money regardless of the coin.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Is the US creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve factored into the price of BTC? No. ,2025-01-06 17:07:47,">""The market is an imperfect forward pricing mechanism.""  
u/nanooverbtc

Is BTC near it's top or will it keep climbing this year. It's an important question with lots of money on the line across all of crypto. If Bitcoin is at the top and only tumbles from here alts will see a bloodbath if Bitcoin has room to climb alts will be lifted and some might be able to make gains against BTC from Alt specific catalysts. 

So with the context of us all having money on the line lets try to answer the question, ""***Is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve factored into the price?""***

***TLDR: NO***

***----***

***What*** **is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?**

A strategic Bitcoin Reserve as introduced by Cynthia Lummis would see the US Government purchase 1M Bitcoin, \~5% of the total Bitcoin Supply over a number of years. [source](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-introduces-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-legislation/)

When Trump first uttered support for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference the price of BTC was \~$68K.

Although the price of Bitcoin was largely sideways until November 7th  as the markets were largely unsure if Trump would be elected and have a chance to implement his plan the price of BTC today sits at $102K, up $34K or +50% since then.

\----

**So is it already factored into the price of Bitcoin?**

The simple answer is no as Trump has a Loooooong history of lying and not fulfilling promises the market overall expects the US not to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in 2025, so despite this being a promise of his campaign and the market having partially priced it in, it is not fully priced in.

Source: Although I have a history of pointing out Polymarket and their shady markets resolves I am going to reference their market ""US National Bitcoin Reserve in 2025?""

Which sits at only 40% as evidence that the current price of Bitcoin hasn't fully priced in a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. After all how can something be priced in when people think there is less than a 2/5th chance of it actually happening.

\---

**Baseless price predictions based off change in BTC price since July 2024 strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement.**

I'm not going to claim this is an accurate prediction but if the price of Bitcoin increased 50% on 40% odds, it actually happening and being fully priced in (+60% odds) would be a 75% increase in BTC or  \~$178K BTC.

**Again this is baseless price predictions looking at only one thing and baselessly extrapolating. But the fact remains a US National Bitcoin Reserve (happening) is not yet priced in to the price of BTC.**",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why Aren't Steady Gains More Appealing in Crypto Copy Trading?,2025-01-07 09:24:48,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been running a well-backtested algo for copy trading on Bybit. It’s designed to survive hard crashes and bear markets while delivering steady, consistent gains. Of course, this means it doesn’t outperform most of the market during strong bull runs due to its very safe setup. However, it really shines when the market turns ""bad.""

For example, a backtest from **2020-06-01 to 2022-12-28** (last bull run through mid-bear) showed:

* **Max unclosed drawdown:** \~20%
* **Closed losses:** \~5%
* **Win rate:** \>90%

Even during rough months when most traders struggled, the algo came out ahead.

Here’s the issue: I’ve noticed that many crypto traders seem uninterested in steady, low-risk gains. Some followers left my copy trades because the gains were “too slow,” but then the moment they saw a 5% drawdown, they left because of “risk.” It feels like there’s this obsession with high-risk moonshots, even though those same rewards can be wiped out quickly by the risks.

I personally prefer slow, steady growth with minimal risk over taking chances on liquidation for potential high rewards. Am I alone in thinking this?

So, I’m curious:

* For those of you trading or copy trading crypto, what do you actually want out of a strategy?
* Are you more interested in slow, steady growth or high-risk, high-reward plays?
* What features or metrics would make you trust and stick with a copy trading strategy?

Let me know your thoughts—I’m open to any feedback or questions about the algo or how it works!

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,A mnemonic system to (almost) effortlessly memorize 128-bit of entropy,2024-12-28 12:47:51,"Hi,

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The latest version of the code can be seen in the PR: [https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9)",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-08 00:53:24.098287
