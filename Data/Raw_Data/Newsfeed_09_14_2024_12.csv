Based on data from CoinMarketCap, The crypto market leader moved by 3.98% on Friday, capping off a rather impressive weekly performance. Commenting on this price gain, prominent blockchain analytics company Santiment has provided insight into shifting market dynamics that may result in a sustained price rally for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Health Remains ‘Net Positive’: ARK Invest Report Bitcoin Accumulation, Exchange Outflow Signal Bullish Sentiment  In an X post on Friday, Santiment shared key developments in the BTC market that could encourage retail investors’ participation in the coming weeks.  The on-chain analytics team reported consistent levels of massive accumulation from BTC whales and sharks. When large-scale investors such as these consistently purchase a massive amount of an asset, especially during downturns or turbulent periods, it indicates confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. 🥳 Bitcoin is within inches of regaining the coveted $60K market value for the first time since falling below back on August 29th. The dynamic duo of mid-term accumulation from sharks & whales, and falling levels of BTC on exchanges, sets the stage for crypto to roll again. pic.twitter.com/LHyxaK4Rci — Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 13, 2024 According to Santiment, Bitcoin sharks and whales i.e. wallets holding 10 BTC and above, have acquired 28,500 BTC in the last three months bringing their total holdings to 16.18 million BTC, valued at $978.29 billion.  Aside from this encouraging accumulation trend, Santiment has also noted a decline in Bitcoin supply on exchanges. For context, an increase in exchange balances of an asset indicates investors are cautious and selling or preparing to sell their holdings. The opposite of such a scenario means that investors are moving their holdings to self-custodial wallets, likely in anticipation of a price rise. Based on Santiment’s report, approximately 75,000 BTC, valued at approximately $4.54 billion, has been withdrawn from exchanges in the last three months, bringing the current total exchange Bitcoin balance to $1.86 million BTC. Santiment concludes that the combination of these two factors i.e. constant accumulation by big investors and a decrease in exchanges BTC supply indicate that Bitcoin and the crypto market at large are gathering momentum for a massive price rally.   Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Retesting $57,000 Is Good For The Price Massive Bullish Divergence Signals Potential Altcoin Rally In other news, crypto analyst Michël van de Poppe has noted a large weekly bullish divergence on TOTAL3/BTC, a trading chart that tracks the combined value of all altcoins excluding Ethereum in BTC.  This bullish divergence largely indicates that selling pressure is weakening and altcoins are about to rally against the crypto market leader. Such notions align with van de Poppe’s long predictions of altcoins superseding Bitcoin in market dominance and performance in the coming months. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $60,369 with a market gain of 4.25% on the last day. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is valued at $2.1 trillion following a 2.55% gain in the last day. Featured image from Reuters, chart from Tradingview",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Recovery Hinges On This Key Market Indicator, Reveals Analyst",2024-09-14 07:00:12+00:00,"The crypto market has recently seen some ups and downs, with Bitcoin facing many fluctuations. According to a recent post by a CryptoQuant analyst known as ‘Kripto Mevsimi,’ the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has dipped below its 365-day moving average. This specific indicator often identifies potential market bottoms and zones where recovery could begin. While the drop in MVRV could suggest an “opportunity for long-term investors,” the analyst warns that caution is needed. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Leverage Ratio Hits New High: What Does This Mean BTC? Bitcoin Will Recover If Its MVRV Does This The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio is a metric used in cryptocurrency to assess whether an asset, like Bitcoin, is overvalued or undervalued relative to its “realized value.” Market Value refers to the asset’s current price multiplied by its total circulating supply, essentially the market capitalization. Realized Value is calculated by summing the value of each coin at the price it was last moved on-chain, giving a picture of what the network participants paid for their holdings. According to Mevsimi, historically, when the Bitcoin MVRV ratio breaks back above its 365-day average, it has been followed by a renewed sense of optimism in the market, often signaling the start of a “more sustainable upward trend.” However, the current economic environment, marked by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, suggests that Bitcoin’s recovery could take longer. In the meantime, the analyst advises investors to maintain a balanced outlook, noting: Therefore, maintaining a measured and balanced perspective is essential. A positive outlook is understandable, but it should be tempered with awareness of the broader risks until the MVRV ratio confirms a more sustained upward momentum.

After briefly dipping below the $58,000 mark earlier in the day, the asset has reversed its trajectory, gaining 1.2% to reach a price of $58,463 at the time of writing. Crypto analyst Mags took to X to highlight a key bullish signal: the Bitcoin hash ribbon. According to Mags, the Bitcoin hash ribbon indicator has flashed a buy signal, historically one of the “most reliable” indicators for Bitcoin’s price movement. Mags mentioned that every time this signal appeared, it was followed by a significant price surge, giving traders reason to believe that Bitcoin could see a bullish breakout soon. #Bitcoin – hash ribbon flashed a buy signal.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-19 20:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,solana,Crypto trading signals on Solana: how to find and use them effectively,2024-09-13 01:10:45,"When to buy, sell, or hold a crypto is a tough decision to make, that’s why signals often provide entry points, take profit, and stop-loss levels based on different indicators. Here’s how to find and use these signals:

# Benefits of crypto trading signals:

* **Reduced emotional decision-making:** Signals can help minimize impulsive trading decisions.
* **Opportunity identification:** They offer insights into potential trades directly.
* **Improved trading rates:** Beneficial for both new and experienced traders, providing ideas that save time and effort.

# How to find quality signal providers:

* **Avoid unrealistic claims:** Be cautious of providers promising 100% accuracy, as these can be scammers trying to signal on scam tokens. Do not take at first-value the announced win rates, you should calculate your own win rates of signals / sources from your own statistics.
* **Look for proven records:** Choose providers with a verified track record and double-check their metrics with your own experimentation.
* **Check community feedback:** Research what other traders think of these sources by reading feedback in the community.

# Practical tips for effective use:

* **Verify signals:** Analyze and confirm signals before acting on them.
* **Start with demos:** Test signals with demo accounts or spreadsheets before trading real assets.
* **Understand macro basics:** Signals paired with a macro understanding will take you to a new level, take the time to master the fundamentals and find the right signals for your strategy.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

**Types of MFA**:

   * **Biometrics**: Use facial recognition or fingerprints.
   * **Physical USB Keys**: Physical devices for verification (like Yubikey).
   * **Google Authenticator App**: This provides time-sensitive codes for secure access.
   * **One-Time Calls or Messages**: An additional layer of verification (common for 2FA).

**Benefits of Multi-Factor Authentication**:

* Better security of your crypto wallet and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
* Protects your investments by adding multiple layers of security measures.
* Why would you not?

**Common threats and prevention:**

**Phishing Attacks:** Use strong passwords, avoid public WiFi, and ensure you're visiting the official links (websites and social media) to protect against phishing.

**Malware Threats:** Equip a good antivirus and malware detector to prevent malware from accessing your private keys.

**Keyloggers:** On PC, you can use Task Manager to detect if a keylogger is installed, some malware applications can automatically detect them too (like Malwarebytes).

**Browser Vulnerabilities:** Avoid storing sensitive data in general browsers, such as never save your passwords on the browser directly, save into a password manager (this way you don’t give away your passwords if you get hacked, look into Lastpass). Use hardware wallets and enable two-factor authentication too.

Laziness and time-saving are bad excuses for not enabling MFA, your trading success is worth it.

 🦞 Solana Boston

Solana Boston, the first-ever Solana city conference in the US, will take place on October 19, 2024, at the MIT Media Lab.

Hosted by Boston DAO and supported by the Solana Foundation, the event is a place for US-based developers to connect, learn, and grow together.

Happening just a month after Breakpoint, Solana Boston hopes to extend the momentum stateside.

[**Solana Boston**](https://www.solanaboston.com/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

### 📅 Breakpoint Agenda

The Breakpoint agenda has been announced with sessions across three key themes:

**Left Curve:**  
This track focuses on culture and products, with a fireside chat between Raj Gokal and Balaji Srinivasan discussing the Solana Network State. 

Highlights include updates on Firedancer, a debate on Crypto East vs. West, and product keynotes from ecosystem founders like FP Lee of Sanctum and Siong of Jupiter.

**Right Curve:**  
A deep dive into tech, featuring sessions on sandwich-resistant AMMs, hands-on Solana Actions, blinks, and ZK compression. A major highlight will be Toly and Mert discussing Solana 2.0.

**Ecosystem Activation:**  
Connect with the community at ""The Pod,"" attend workshops, and level up Radar hackathon projects at the [Colosseum Arena](https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseums-hackathon-arena-at-solana-breakpoint-2024/).

### 🗳️ Blockworks MetaDAO Report

This report from Blockworks explores how MetaDAO leverages *futarchy* to improve governance, its early results, and the potential this governance model holds for DAOs seeking to align decision-making with financial incentives.

The futarchy protocol proposed by MetaDAO addresses a flaw in DAO governance: misaligned incentives and inefficient decision-making. 

By leveraging conditional markets, futarchy turns speculation into a tool that lets market participants ""bet"" on the outcome of proposals based on if they believe a decision will positively affect a token's market value. 

Traders evaluate the impact of a decision based on data rather than pure opinion or ideology. The outcome could lead to more value-driven decisions for DAOs. 

MetaDAO is pioneering this approach by directly applying it to its own governance, making it both a platform and a case study for futarchy-based decision-making.

However, this model is still in an experimental phase. 

With just \~$675k in market volume and 15 proposals, the liquidity and participation levels remain modest. Without sufficient trading volume and participation, the markets may not produce reliable signals, which is key to the success of futarchy. 

If successful, futarchy could not only improve DAO governance, but also attract wider adoption across Solana, particularly among organizations seeking more efficient decision-making processes.

### 🏦 The Finternet on Solana

The [Finternet](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1178.pdf?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is an initiative to create a global network of tokenized assets such as stablecoins, stocks, and NFTs where users can transact with anyone worldwide.

To support this goal, Solana Foundation has announced a $1M grant program for developers, founders, and policy professionals contributing to building the Finternet on Solana. 

Grants range from $1,000 to $10,000 and focus on areas like user applications, token management tools, authentication wallets, and the Unified Ledger infrastructure. 

[**Solana Foundation Finternet Instagrants**](https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/finternet-grants/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

### 💰 Solana Foundation RFPs

The Solana Foundation has announced two new RFPs aimed at driving the development of open source data tooling for the Solana blockchain, with up to $160,000 in available funding.

The **Solana Indexer Tooling RFP** offers $100,000 in funding to develop an open-source infrastructure solution for accessing real-time and historical data from Solana programs and accounts. 

Deliverables include a tool for indexing real-time and historical updates for a set of accounts and programs using Anchor IDLs with features like account tracking, program listeners, transaction indexes, and integration with the Luzid local validator.

The **Solana Discriminator Directory RFP** provides $60,000 in funding to create an open-source discriminator database, which aims to enable developers to interact with unknown deployed programs and parse their instructions. 

The goal is to build a comprehensive solution that simplifies how developers access and manage program discriminators on Solana, making it easier for them to work with programs whose details may not be fully known or accessible.

The proposed solution includes the development of an API that allows developers to fetch program discriminators and access a community-managed dataset. This dataset will allow users to upload discriminators making it available to others in a structured format.

Both RFPs are open for submissions until October 4, 2024.

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-12 13:57:32,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

During this time I saw many many bad things. Rug pulls, soft rugs, abandoned projects and false promises.

Also I think that almost all characters of memecoins lacks personality. You see the same images everywhere. 

So I think that there is a space for a new one that is REALLY fun. I have been writing for MAD and decided to quit the job and launch my own character.

My plan is to do the REAL thing. A character that will survive and last more than a pump and dump. We will have small movies every week with profissional actors doing the voices. 

It took me a lot of time to realize that I know about content but a successful project is much more than that.

So I researched a lot and gathered a team of 8 people. Now we have designers, tokenomics specialist, a manager, an artist for animations and a guy in contact with KOLs (i don’t know if we use them, so much horror stories about dumping at the followers).

I’ll try to make things different. Depending on the reaction at this post I’ll keep on posting and showing you stuff of the project. Hope you all enjoy! ",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Everything seems to be just fine, txn's get in quite fast from what I see in charts, but in code actual ""confirmation"" takes 19+ seconds, always, despite me seeing new 1 second candle on chart in first 3-5 seconds after code enters in ""SendAndConfirmTransactionAsync"". Commitmment is used ""Finalized"".  
Line is:

    RequestResult<string> result = await rpcClient.SendAndConfirmTransactionAsync(
      preswapInfo.SignedTransaction, skipPreflight: true);

So, why is that?

This is NOT rpc/internet/pc whatever problem. This seems to be something with actual code and methodology with how txn's are confirmed and perhaps commitment thing.

In [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI after executing txn I literally see ""Your transaction was confirmed"" in same time as 1 second candle is displayed on chart, so, it confirms in same time.  
Why my solution is not working? Is [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI using other commitment for confirmations?  
Can anyone who KNOWS answer has ideas guide me on this one?

Reddit,solana,"I made a Solana memecoin tracking bot, and here's what I learned",2024-09-11 18:13:04,"Hey Solana fam! 👋

A while back, I shared a bot I made for tracking PumpFun graduates. Well, I've been working on it non-stop since then, and I wanted to share what I've learned along the way.

# The Journey

What started as a simple alert system has grown into a full-fledged trading companion. Here's what I discovered:

1. **Pump monitoring isn't enough.** Sure, it's exciting to catch new listings, but there's so much more to consider.
2. **Volume tells a story.** I added a volume analyzer and was shocked at how it revealed hidden gems across different market caps.
3. **Whales matter.** Tracking large trades (over $100k) has been eye-opening. It's fascinating to see how these moves can influence the market.
4. **One size doesn't fit all.** Everyone has their own trading style, so I made the alerts customizable.

# What I Built

Without turning this into an ad, here's what the bot can do now:

* Alert on new Raydium listings
* Provide daily and weekly rankings
* Analyze volume-to-FDV ratios
* Track whale movements
* Let users customize their notifications

# The Biggest Lesson

The most important thing I've learned? **On-chain data is king.** No paid promos, no shilling, just pure data. It's been a game-changer for my own trading.

# What's Next?

I'm constantly tweaking and improving based on feedback. If you're interested in checking it out or have ideas for new features, let me know! The bot's called MemeToolsAlertBot on Telegram.

Has anyone else built tools for trading? What insights have you gained? Let's share knowledge and elevate the whole community!

Reddit,solana,📉 Traders to Avoid When Copy Trading on Solana:,2024-09-11 18:22:17,"
1. Scalper Traders: Their trades typically last less than a minute, making it unprofitable to copy them with free copy trading bots due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)

2. Traders with Numerous Buys: If a trader makes more than 4-5 buys, it becomes challenging to manage money effectively. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your deposit per trade and the trader makes 7-9 buys of a scam token, you could lose 70-90% of your assets.

3. Mixed Token Traders: These traders receive tokens from other wallets and also purchase tokens themselves. Their profit and loss (PnL) on trades may be higher than yours due to tokens received from external sources.

4. Token snipers: These traders buy tokens at the start of their market appearance (first candle). Using free copy trading bots with them can lead to losses due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,solana,I can't wrap my head around this whole rent thing.,2024-09-11 08:12:03,"I only started using solana a few days ago, I'm developing a bot which accepts payments from different users. For that I use the solana rpc.

So a user can join a ""list"" (by some sort of cmd) and he then gets an address where he can send money to. Each user has his own address, this is to keep track of everything and keep it organized. Now, the problem I had when sending transactions on the devnet is, that these new empty accounts need to have some funds at first so they can accept new funds from the user. As far as I understood this is for the rent.

>Transaction results in an account (1) with insufficient funds for rent

But why can't this rent be taken from the first transaction the user makes to that address? Why does it need funds prior to that? I fixed it by using an airdrop, but since I'm only on the devnet I'm unsure if this will even work on the mainnet.

I'd appreciate some guidance if some of you are experienced with this kind of problem.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

I had only few SOL and free NFT mints from MagicEden on the wallet. Is that an airdrop from MagicEden?

Don't get me wrong, but spending 0.002 SOL per wallet it's expensive af for making a huge airdrop.

For sure it's useful in terms of marketing, but why wouldn't you make a claim site, it's much cheaper and efficient?

Even more, it's also cheap, you can hire a dev or do it without coding with no-code platforms like Smithii.

Also apply a vesting period to an amount of your Solana token supply and set a receiver wallet.

The tool is [Solana Token Vesting](https://tools.smithii.io/token-vesting/solana)

What would you use it for? Is there a vesting strategy to improve a token project success? 

Also, it is good choise to lock a LP token instead of burn it?

Reddit,solana,Crypto Solana portfolio management: balancing risk and reward,2024-09-10 23:24:15,"Managing a Solana portfolio requires a careful balance between risk and reward (profits you want and losses you can afford). Many investors struggle with maintaining this balance, often due to a lack of risk management strategies and knowledge.

Here are key pointers for effective cryptocurrency portfolio management:

1. **Diversification across cryptos:** While major players like Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin are common, consider including promising altcoins/memecoins to spread risk or even to optimize upsides.
2. **Market volatility and regulations:** Staying informed about market trends and regulations is relatively easy considering a small change can heavily impact your portfolio performance, you don’t want to be late on the big news when they happen.
3. **Setting clear goals:** You need short-term and long-term plans. Focus on strategic growth and keep track of your gains with a real possible plan to get there. Betting on luck is not enough to stay aligned with your investment objectives.
4. **Rebalancing your portfolio:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain the level of risk and reward you think is okay.
5. **Risk strategy**: Have a good risk strategy to compensate for high fluctuations and unexpected events, as crypto is mostly about those two types of events. Successful traders excel at predicting the unpredictable, which is different from traditional stock investing.
6. **Take profits and cut losses:** Don’t stay too long in a position when you’ve hit your target or your limit, remember the long-term game!
7. **Market caps variety**: Invest in a mix of large, mid, and small-cap cryptocurrencies depending on your strategy and expectations. Consulting successful traders can guide you towards what kind of market caps you should look at based on your objectives.
8. **Asset variety**: NFTs and DeFi staking can be considered for Solana traders to diversify your portfolio, yet consider how the macro trends impact the volume and performance of NFTs versus tokens.

Careful planning is always key.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-10 14:08:52,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,solana,Spot breakout patterns: a guide for Solana crypto smart traders,2024-09-10 15:33:58,"Trading crypto on Solana is complex, so understanding breakout patterns can be valuable info for smart traders. A breakout occurs when a crypto’s price moves beyond a defined support or resistance level, it can be a potential shift in the market trends.

Here are some key breakout patterns that can assist crypto traders:

* **Avoid weak breakouts:** Weak breakouts may lack the volume necessary to sustain momentum, leading to false signals. Always ensure that a breakout is supported by significant trading volume to confirm its strength.
* **Continuation breakouts:** These occur when the price breaks in the direction of the prevailing trend. They are useful for confirming a trend change. Continuation breakouts often signal that the current trend will persist, providing opportunities for traders to enter or exit positions strategically.
* **Reversal breakouts:** Reversal breakouts happen when a price trend changes direction, either from an uptrend to a downtrend or vice versa. It's crucial to analyze the current trends and determine which are reaching their peak or bottom levels to identify potential reversal points.

Using tools like trading signals can further help in taking fast decisions to find and time these breakouts more easily.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

I've transferred it to new phones over the years, but haven't tried to transfer funds out in about 3 years or so.

As far as I understood, they defined sigma(a) as the account state and sigma(a)\_s as the storageRoot hash of the Merkle trie that has all the account's storage data. L\* is the collapse function that hashes all the key value pairs. So, I am guessing they are using the equivalent relationship to connect the Merkle Trie with the trie's root hash. But why is L\* also taking the storageRoot hash?

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?

2. Any ERC 20 / ERC 721 etc transaction that happened
3. Any internal (Call) transactions.
4. Gives status of the transaction (Weather it was successfull or not)
5. Denomination of the token involved (contract address, symbol, decimal, logo)

I have tested following providers:

1. Moralis: They have the perfect endpoint that i was looking for (Moralis.EvmApi.wallets.getWalletHistory) but they are not providing correct information or even missing information in the transactions. They also dont provide the state of transaction, so even if the transaction has failed they provide the data as if the transaction happened.
2. Etherscan: Although i can't get all the above information in the same api call, i can if i combine multiple endpoints, but they are limited to 10000 records which makes them unusable.
3. Tatum: They dont provide information regarding Internal transaction
4. Alchemy: They have this endpoint ""alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers"" which was kinda perfect but they dont give information regarding transaction status.

Any API providers that you guys suggest that will have all those information (preferably in a single call)? Usually i see the providers dont have information regarding the internal transactions.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 13:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

I currently hold ( Amount) in ETH with an average cost of $2340. I've run into some financial issues (layoff/exhausted unemployment) and am hoping to liquidate some of my holdings to sustain myself and my family.

My question is, if I hypothetically sold $1000 profit per withdrawal and left my principal deposit dollar amount untouched, is this a smart tactic for DCA'ing out? Also, will withdrawing $1000 per transaction increase my future cost average as well? Will this reduce my profit margins in the future as my quantity of ETH ownership decreases?

I realize the quantity of ETH that I own will get smaller but as long as the market value continues to increase, I should hypothetically be able to keep DCA'ing out profit, if needed?

At the end of the day, i'm a firm believer in ETH and am extremely bullish. My goal is to maintain my principal deposit amount but only pull profits.
Please let me know if i'm headed in the wrong direction here or may be looking at this process the wrong way.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Let's call that exactly 1 Bitcoin for the purposes of this discussion, which means that 1 bitcoin equals 1 year of work right now. In 2034, people talk about Bitcoin being worth ""big numbers"" such as 10 million dollars, but what does that matter if 10 million dollars isn't enough to retire on at that point due to inflation or something else? 

Instead, I'm wanting to know what you think Bitcoin will be worth in 2034 in terms of the amount of years the average American would need to work in order to earn 1 full coin? I believe that thinking of Bitcoin's ""price"" like this is a much more helpful way to go about the discussion of the future, as well as being something very easy to conceptualize. 

What's your opinion? How many years do you personally think will need to be worked by the average citizen in order to earn 1 Bitcoin in 2034, and why do you think what you think?

Reddit,bitcoin,How to find what wallet btc was sent to?,2024-09-13 22:54:48,"I recently noticed about a year ago a small amount of Bitcoin was sent from my trezor wallet to some address. But I don’t know why, as I never spend my btc.  Around that time I had set up a couple different wallets, and an umbrel node (with wallets). 

One of these was a Jade wallet using the Green app. The Green app never worked, it kept freezing, even after reinstalling it, trying different versions, and contacting support. So I don’t use it. It has no balance. 

At one point my umbrel node just disappeared. I don’t know what happened. It just vanished.  When trying to login it would only give me the prompt to set up a new one. As if it had never been set up. Luckily I had never used it for transactions. I ended up completely reinstalling umbrel and setting up everything again. 

I suspect the small amount of Bitcoin I sent was to test one of these wallets.  I have the on chain transaction info and it is logged on my trezor. Is there a way to use that info to see or deduce where or what wallet it was sent to?

Thanks. 

Edit: don’t send me any dms asking me to synchronize my wallet to some website or enter seed phrase. I won’t do it. ",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

One thing I have always said is that Bitcoin first started out for the rebels 
This is the first set of information I have seen where they speak about the origin of cyberpunks . 

Bitcoin was for natural rebels that wanted to say fuck you to the system. 

It was fuck you government and fuck you banks. 

Complete anti-authorities ism. And we fucking loved it. 

There were no tools yet that made a type of libertarianism 100% entirely true , decentralized, and “off grid” per se. 

Not equating libertarians to vegans lol but hey, off rip the only difference there id say is meat lol but in the sense of real self dependence, no third parties needed from militia, banks, stores (gardens) etc 

Even then, we can never truly be decentralized until our internet is. Why is this not the number one thing being worked on? 
Ai makes us more dependent on the internet to “simplify” our lives which basically is all it is used for by the regular daily person. 

So if we are going to become even more dependent upon computers and internet, then why is real decentralization not hand in hand with AI building?

So many people want to combat the two, blockchain and AI. They are apples and oranges. They are both used for one application. You use AI for the origin implementation whereas blockchain technology is the carrier, the end game. The system that does the heavy lifting by being the actual system, but AI is as well the heavy lifter by being the one that starts and puts everything together. ",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

There's a tale of a man, both young and bold,
With a passion for stacking, not just any kind,
But sats, the smallest part of Bitcoin you'll find.

He dreams of the cycle, the bull run so grand,
Where Bitcoin will soar, like a phoenix from sand,
He's stacking, he's saving, with each passing day,
For the wealth that will come, in this Bitcoin ballet.

From morning till night, his thoughts never stray,
From the charts and the news, in the crypto fray,
He's obsessed, he's possessed, by the satoshi's might,
Envisioning freedom, in the bull market's light.

""Oh, sats, my dear sats,"" he whispers in glee,
""With you, I'll break chains, I'll set my bloodline free,""
He plans and he schemes, with a heart full of fire,
For the day when his sats will climb ever higher.

This cycle, he swears, will change his life's course,
With Bitcoin's ascent, he'll gain financial force,
He'll buy land and castles, or maybe just peace,
With the wealth from his sats, his worries will cease.

He'll teach his kids wisdom, of money and more,
How to stack sats and keep them in store,
For generations to come, his bloodline will see,
The fruits of his stacking, his obsession, his spree.

So here's to the man, with his sats in a stack,
Who dreams of the day, when he'll never look back,
To the life-changing wealth, this cycle will bring,
And the freedom he'll give, to his kin and his king.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

I tell her to Google how much money did the FED print in the last 8 years and she keeps finding government websites that publish statistics about how many bills and coins are minted and printed. I tell her no that is the process of replacing old bills with new bills. I am talking about creating money and changing a number in a bank account on a computer with no gold or asset backing it. 

She wants something published by the government that itemizes how much money they created and I can't really find a solid source for this information.

Reddit,bitcoin,be aware of a currently ongoing phishing campaign targeting coinbase.com,2024-09-12 03:31:17,"I just received a very believable phishing attack targeting coinbase.com, and I wanted to make the community aware of the attack. 

The attack starts by an automated phone system calling you, and informing you that someone from germany attempted to change the phone number associated with your coinbase account. It prompts you to press ""1"" on your phone if it was an action you did not perform.

After doing so, you will receive a follow up call a handful of minutes later. The person on the phone sounded like a native English speaker, and had enough familiarity with cryptocurrency and the related jargon that they came off as knowledgeable.

During the phone call, they sent an email to verify their identity. The email comes from a Russian server, fakes the sender email to appear as help@coinbase.com, and utilizes a domain which contains utf-8 characters to appear as if it is the legitimate coinbase domain if you inspect the email headers (help@coìnbase.com) (notice the weird 'i' in the domain).

I did not proceed with the phishing attempt after this point, as getting the domain is enough to temporarily halt the attack. I have already reached out to coinbase, as well as the domain registrar they used for the domain... but if you receive a call similar to what I described, do not engage with the automated system. I assume by pressing ""1"", you are placed in a queue for the scammer to reach out to you.

Reddit,bitcoin,Two massive sources of buying pressure are coming soon - FTX repayments and public companies ,2024-09-12 11:47:11,"We all remember Mt. Gox and the FUD that those repayments would create tons of selling pressure which never really materialized, or wasn't as substantial as some people were predicting. But now we have another round of re-payments from a defunct exchange, only this time the payments are going to be made in CASH. So it's almost certain that a significant percentage of those who are repaid with cash by FTX will re-buy bitcoin with at least a portion of their money. The total repayments are at around 12.7 Billion and will create a significant amount of buyers and demand liquidity starting very soon. [https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-seeks-creditor-votes-bankruptcy-wind-down-payments-2024-06-25/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-seeks-creditor-votes-bankruptcy-wind-down-payments-2024-06-25/)

If that wasn't already good enough news on its own, there's also a new estimate that Michael Saylor's predictions about U.S. companies deciding to add BTC to their balance sheets is an accurate forecast of what's to come. If only a fraction of the top companies put even a small percentage of their cash equivalent balance into bitcoin it will mean a massive influx of over 10.3 Billion in the next 18 months. Once CEOs of top companies and boards of directors, and investors see competing companies improving their financials by holding BTC it will be sure to start a domino effect or chain reaction of corporations quickly hopping on the trend, and it's also fantastic inflation protection and a hedge against country specific geopolitical risks as well.

Why I'm with them is a long story but mainly because of business reasons. When I started using TransferWise the company was kind of cool. No problems and easy to use etc. Now it is a different story, not only they have stopped supporting multiple accounts in foreign countries but they are not allowing me to invest in bitcoin or crypto in general. I do not have a exact time-frame when it started but you are now simply unable to use their card to send money to crypto exchange. After multiple emails to them explaining that this is what I want so stop blocking my payments. So for  I got no reply what so ever. 

I guess these kind of companies are going to be first to go down as bitcoin will reduce the need for intermediary banks by enabling peer-to-peer transactions. This will disrupt the current banking model, where institutions like Wise earn revenue from international transfers and exchange fees.

Maybe you have some feedback or better ideas? My ideas right now are:

I could upgrade the script so it can track the balance of the user's wallet. This could be easier to understand than the price of a coin.

Reddit,bitcoin,What is your favorite/easiest way to explain Bitcoin and blockchain concepts?,2024-09-12 16:53:57,"When I explain Bitcoin and blockchain, I like to use the analogy of a giant, digital accounting book that records every transaction ever made. Think of this book as being made up of blank pages, and each page holds a list of all the transactions that happened within a period of time.

Once a page is full, (meaning it contains all the transactions from that period), it gets permanently added to the book. But we always need a new blank page to keep recording transactions, and this is where the miners come in.

Miners are like accountants competing to create the next page in the book. But instead of just writing it down, they have to solve a complex puzzle (which takes a lot of computer power). Once a miner solves the puzzle, they earn the right to add the new page (called a block) to the book, and they get rewarded with newly created Bitcoin.

Each new page is linked to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks (which is why we call it a ""blockchain""). What makes this system unique is that it’s decentralized, meaning there is not a single authority controlling it (like banks). Everyone in the network has a copy of this accounting book, and once a page (block) is added, it cannot be changed. This ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, resistant to fraud and written in this digital books forever.

Before a transaction is added, though, it has to be verified. The ""accountants"" (nodes in the network) check all previous pages to make sure the person making the transaction actually owns the Bitcoin they want to spend. If the system finds that a person is trying to spend more Bitcoin than they have, the transaction is refused. This prevents people from spending Bitcoin they don’t own, similar to how your bank won’t let you withdraw more money than you have in your account.

During my time off, I hurt my foot and cannot get back to work until maybe November (Doctor's orders), but this entire time I thought I would be able to work in a couple of weeks (emergency room prognosis).            

The company that I work for has hired a lot of new personnel recently, and the sites that they manage and business that they do grew like crazy in the past 30 days.             

I will inevitably have to sell some btc to survive, and, to me, that is not a major issue. The part that makes me sad is seeing the company I work for grow without me.           

Sorry if this is irrelevant. I just want to vent a bit.              

EDIT: I sustained an ankle injury that resulted in a ""lateral malleolus fracture."" The orthopedic doctor I saw told me that this is basically gonna take 4 or 5 months after the date of my injury taking place to be able to do all movement necessary to do my job.

I *can* walk on it and put weight on it, but it's not a good idea to do so, and if I do it too much, I can make the problem worse.             

EDIT 2: I'm not in the *worst* situation, so don't feel too sorry for me. I'm living with my parents after going abroad for a decade (only been back for 4 months now) and if this didn't happen, I would've moved out and gotten my own apartment in October.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Introducing the Doom Olympics a 7-day gaming competition with $15,000 in prizes. Powered by RIVES (an onchain gaming console) a Cartesi Roll-Up + an AMA and Cartesi Swag Giveaway",2024-09-14 00:18:39,"Hello, [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/), we're excited to be here for another AMA!

This time, we are excited to introduce you to one of the dApps developed with Cartesi Rollups: RIVES, an onchain fantasy console that runs retro games and programs entirely onchain, enabling every element—from gameplay to interactions—to be fully verifiable.

RIVES started by bringing verifiable DOOM onchain, and since then, the team has developed an entire game console with a custom emulator that is verifiable onchain. It enables creating, verifying, and distributing of small expressive games called cartridges. By verifying gameplays, the platform creates tapes (replayable onchain gameplay logs) and adds players to immutable leaderboards. The platform has launched on mainnet this week with a gaming competition, the first of its kind - The DOOM Olympics: a 7-day event with 7 unique contests (or disciplines) using the Freedoom build. This contest takes place between September 12 and 20, with $15,000 in prizes. We'll be here to answer questions for an AMA tomorrow, September 14th, from 1 pm UTC until around 3 pm UTC. Ask questions about RIVES/Cartesi

# About Cartesi 

[Cartesi](https://cartesi.io/) is a powerful modular blockchain protocol that supercharges the web3 space. It equips developers with access to a full Linux environment through its native virtual machine, and high-performance rollups designed to support next-generation dApps.

Cartesi’s mission is to expand what is possible in Web3 and unlock the power of decentralization by allowing developers access to existing tools and libraries to build more efficiently, as well as a dedicated CPU for their dApp, avoiding competition for blockspace while maintaining the security guarantees of the base layer. Cartesi Rollups can be deployed as L2, L3 (on top of Optimism, Arbitrum, Base etc.), or sovereign rollups. Learn more and explore use cases enabled by Cartesi here: [https://cartesi.io/usecases/](https://cartesi.io/usecases/)

# Introducing RIVES built with Cartesi Rollups

[RIVES](https://rives.io/) (which stands for **RISC-V Verifiable Entertainment System**) is an onchain fantasy console that allows creating, distributing, and playing of cartridges (small programs), and tapes (verified interactions).

Unlike most Web3 games or platforms, RIVES leans into blockchain capabilities to the fullest. Not only are the assets onchain, but also the game logic and state, unlocking new possibilities. RIVES can run complex games like DOOM fully verifiably. Gameplays/scores (e.g., speedruns) can be verified and proven without intermediaries and stored in history forever. On top of this, it enables new forms of modding and composability.

# DOOM Olympics

The DOOM Olympics is a 7-day DOOM competition on RIVES where players partake in 7 different DOOM contests/disciplines. The 7 contests are: Lightning Run, Knuckle Crusher, Infallible Aim, Secret Master, Treasure Seeker, The Completionist, Enemy Eradicator.

Each contest features its unique scoring system and set of objectives. Each gameplay runs locally in the browser within the same Cartesi VM and is verifiable on-chain. Players generate tapes—verified gameplay and interaction logs—using cartridges (small games), such as the DOOM cartridge in this case. After the player submits their logs to the RIVES rollup for verification, the nodes execute the same deterministic Cartesi VM, thereby securing them a spot on the leaderboard in a verifiable, transparent, and cheat-resistant manner.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I analyzed today's crypto sentiment to see you y'all reacted to the recent pump,2024-09-14 10:04:14,"Since Bitcoin is back up to $60k, I decided to run my crypto sentiment analysis bot and see how the market feels today, and determine whether there is any strong correlation between the price movement and the overall community sentiment.

As my basis for measurement, I’m analysing data from this subreddit. There generally tends to be less hype and very little (to no) memecoin shilling, so it’s a fairly clean dataset in that respect.

The bot takes into account post titles and post descriptions from the Hot. The bot is Open Source and can even place trades on sentiment signals, I'll leave a link to GitHub down below.

Without further ado: here are today’s Sentiment Values, I’ll keep it nice and short.

https://preview.redd.it/v7bfy88g0rod1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=40193a7be38a8ff4556561e9e3b5538a6ef881a9

The sentiment values range between -1 and 1, with -1 being extremely negative and 1 being extremely positive. I’ve also highlighted the cells so defining notable thresholds.

On average, the sentiment seems fairly positive, however altcoins seem to have a more positive sentiment than Bitcoin, which sits at 0.17. This is only slightly positive.

Ethereum is a bit more positive with 0.29 but still relatively reserved.

I am applying a strategy I have applied to the S&P500 which has been profitable for me short to medium term. It's a very bot-like strategy, that opens and closes positions very soon based on volume criteria. It can make profit on as low as 0.04% deviation from open price.

I've opened a 13 ETH position with leverage and closed 1m later for +14.29 USDT PNL just to validate my strategy on crypto.   
Little did I know that after taking all fees, I was at loss. 

Did my homework and saw my cex/broker charging 0.02% maker, 0.05% taker.

I was just informed that my personal information was leaked by an employee of a well-known crypto platform, and I am fuming.

A couple days ago i had specifically contacted their customer service because someone had threatened to gain access to my information. I explicitly requested that no information about my account should be disclosed to anyone under any circumstances.

This person just informed me that they obtained the information from an employee. At first i thought it was a bluff until they disclosed accurate information about my email and telephone number as well as recent changes i made to this email adress since i had security concerns.

I’m reaching out to this community for advice on how to handle this situation and any potential legal actions I should consider. Here are the steps I’m currently taking:

i have demanded an immediate explanation and investigation from the platform into how this happened, why my request was ignored, and what actions they are taking against the employee responsible. I’m also asking for assurances that they will prevent this from happening.

If anyone has experience in pursuing legal action against a company for a data breach i‘d be glad to hear your story.

I would greatly appreciate any advice",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,RWAs: A Safe Haven for On-Chain Yields?,2024-09-13 12:04:24,"*Binance research report - summary bullets as pasted below:*

> Real-world assets (“RWAs”) refer to tokenized, on-chain versions of tangible and intangible non-blockchain assets, e.g., currencies, real estate, bonds, commodities, etc. Total on-chain RWAs are at all-time highs at US$12B+ (excluding the US$175B+ stablecoin market).

> Key categories within the RWA space include tokenized US Treasuries, private credit, commodities, stocks, real estate, and other non-US bonds. Emerging categories include air rights, carbon credits, and fine art. 

> The increased involvement of institutional and traditional finance (“TradFi”) in the RWA space has been a notable recent growth driver. BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized Treasury product is the category leader (market cap > US$500M), and their US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are the largest in the market. Franklin Templeton’s FBOXX is the second largest tokenized Treasury product, while WisdomTree has expanded even further with their tokenized equity products and other “Digital Funds”. 

> The foundational infrastructure of RWAs include smart contracts, oracles, identity & compliance, and custody solutions. Oracles are critical as they ensure that on-chain representations accurately reflect off-chain, real-world data. They also help initiate on-chain actions based on off-chain legal agreements. The development of RWA-specific oracles is an interesting development to keep an eye on. 

> In our project analysis, we cover six projects. These include Ondo (structured finance), Open Eden (tokenized Treasuries), Centrifuge (tokenization, structured credit, aggregation), Parcl (synthetic real estate), Toucan (tokenized carbon credits), and Jiritsu (zero knowledge tokenization). 

> There are several technical risks to be aware of when considering RWAs. Among these, we have centralization (due to the very nature of RWAs and regulatory requirements), third-party dependencies (particularly for asset custody), whether the complexity of the system is worth the yield, the robustness and dependency of oracles, as well as privacy & compliance considerations. 

> From a macroeconomic perspective, we are set to commence on a historic rate cutting cycle in the US, which might have consequences for many RWA protocols, particularly those focused on tokenized US Treasuries. The concern around the legal landscape surrounding RWAs also remains.

The attack starts by an automated phone system calling you, and informing you that someone from germany attempted to change the phone number associated with your coinbase account. It prompts you to press ""1"" on your phone if it was an action you did not perform.

After doing so, you will receive a follow up call a handful of minutes later. The person on the phone sounded like a native English speaker, and had enough familiarity with cryptocurrency and the related jargon that they came off as knowledgeable.

During the phone call, they sent an email to verify their identity. The email comes from a Russian server, fakes the sender email to appear as help@coinbase.com, and utilizes a domain which contains utf-8 characters to appear as if it is the legitimate coinbase domain if you inspect the email headers (help@coìnbase.com) (notice the weird 'i' in the domain).

I did not proceed with the phishing attempt after this point, as getting the domain is enough to temporarily halt the attack. I have already reached out to coinbase, as well as the domain registrar they used for the domain... but if you receive a call similar to what I described, do not engage with the automated system. I assume by pressing ""1"", you are placed in a queue for the scammer to reach out to you.

Further, you earn interest on that USDC even if that USDC is currently on a buy order. 
In other words, you can sit pretty with your money growing while waiting for a drop.
Therefore, it makes sense to me that this will result in a far less steep crash (if you believe we have passed this cycle's bull run and we're destined for a 50% correcion) than before as more people are content to wait on the sidelines with buy orders.

Disclaimer: I am saying this as someone whose coinbase assets are currently allocated 30% crypto, 20% buy order waiting (USDC), 50% money on the sidelines (USDC)

# August Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eight months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/mcaxyv3my5od1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=da26b8f86fd4dde37c87e3568c5e4678c117f3c8

# August Winners and Losers

***August Winners*** – No winners this month, although **XRP** (-6%) lost the least ground in August.

***August Losers*** – **ETH, DOT,** and **SOL** fell the most this month, dropping -23%, -22%, and -21% respectively.

# Overall Update: BNB securely in first place, BTC in second. 60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+61%) remains in the overall lead followed distantly by second place **BTC** (+28%). **SOL** (+16%) is third.

Eight months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -53% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** eight months ago is worth $161 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $156 in August.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$946.**  For the second time this year, the Top Ten Portfolio has ended a month below the break even point.

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a

**August Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14% 
* **AMKT**: -18%.

The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5%
*  **AMKT:** +7%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/cjb73jbxy5od1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbadf0addedbe13bc3aca8c409a0b8105184dd5

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94

The S&P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/wb9vc2a4z5od1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=8086a62642ba07b5504e3c8d71e34a62d8fd8b8e

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  August’s extended report is on the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Large outflows of native USDC on certain chains (notably AVAX, Polygon, Stellar, and NEAR)",2024-09-12 05:13:56,"I have been using [usdc.cool](http://usdc.cool) to track changes in native issued $USDC across chains (mostly the coin that shall not be named in this sub). In doing so I noticed that several chains had quite substantial reductions in natively-issued USDC on chain.

For instance, in the past week, these chains had the following reductions (measured in $ and in %).

Stellar - down 64.93% ($180.1M)

NEAR - down 39.33% ($112.2M)

AVAX - down 13.27% ($69.4M)

Polygon - down 11.02% ($96.8M)

I know this is crypto and all, and that things are volatile, but these are pretty clear outliers. And this seems like a sudden drop across multiple chains all at once. To me, these sorts of dramatic swings can really only be explained by VCs  packing up and leaving.

My initial thought was that perhaps the money is moving from one chain to be issued in the native form on another. This could be the case, but if so, they don't seem to be picking any one specific chain as the raw dollars and percentage changes for other chains don't show outright favoritism. The one exception seems to be ETH. Though it doesn't have the highest percentage increase amongst chains (3.47%), it is a rather large raw dollar increase $814M (indeed it is the only chain with a raw dollar increase rivaling the aggregate outflows from these other chains).

I'm not exactly sure what to make of it, but it does have me wondering what prompted these sudden USDC redemptions, where the money is going, and why.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Exclusive Tari Universe AMA w/ fluffypony & Naveen (Tari Contributors),2024-09-11 18:09:46,"First up, who are these folks?

* fluffypony is a contributor to Tari and the former lead maintainer of Monero. 
* Naveen also contributes to Tari and is a serial entrepreneur, YC alum, and prolific angel investor in startups. 

They will be here **TOMORROW, September 12, 2024 at 11AM ET / 3PM UTC** to answer your questions about [Tari Universe](https://universe.tari.com/) and [Tari](https://www.tari.com). Please feel free to submit your questions in advance - early submissions get priority! We'll do our best to get to as many of them as possible and answer any questions you may have.

**What is Tari?**

Tari is a layer 1 blockchain protocol built in Rust with an ingenious approach to scaling its on-chain user base to millions of people and a native app distribution platform that gives developers access to every user. Tari is also default-confidential (yay!) and has a unique dual-layer architecture: ASIC-resistant proof-of-work L1, and native HotStuff + Cerberus-based L2. Tari is currently live on testnet. The mainnet is coming SOON (later this year).

**What is Tari Universe?**

[THIS IS NOT VAPORWARE](https://preview.redd.it/f8oa36osz7od1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e65d454fab2c7a05cb11635f94a7ed6edadf6b7)

Tari Universe is the world's most beautiful and easiest-to-use mining app. The goal: create a user experience where anyone with a modern Mac or PC can download Tari Universe, install it, and start mining with the least effort (and clicks) possible!

The first version of Tari Universe is focused on mining. In the future, it’ll include a native app launcher so everyone in the Tari community can easily discover and use Tari dapps (tapplets!). This is how we also plan to solve the developer distribution conundrum! 

**Why is all this important?** 

Because onboarding new people to crypto is hard, and we’ve strayed from the original goal of our industry. In the beginning, anyone could download free software from the internet and mine Bitcoin on their PC. Everything was permissionless. Today, things are a lot more complicated. For the most popular cryptocurrencies, you need to jump through many hoops, KYC, and buy someone else's coins to participate. 

Then, once you have coins, good luck discovering dapps to use. Either you need to be deep in the trenches here on Reddit or X, or you need to roll the dice on Google and pray you don’t get phished. 

Our mission is to create a world where anyone can download Tari Universe for free, mine Tari, and (eventually) access the world of Tari dapps (tapplets!) at their fingertips, no matter their experience level.

We announced Tari Universe publicly [HERE](https://x.com/tari/status/1824126337855987732), and over 210,000 people have joined the waitlist since then. 

We are inviting the first round of folks from the waitlist to download Tari Universe **TOMORROW** and as a gift to the r/cryptocurrency community, we will be giving **instant access codes to download Tari Universe to 10 lucky participants from this AMA**!

We’ll randomly pick and DM all the winners after the event! Thank you in advance for your interest and questions! See you soooon!

*“AI agents cannot get bank accounts, but they can get crypto wallets. They can now use USDC on Base to transact with humans, merchants, or other AIs. Those transactions are instant, global, and free,”* he added.

*“This week at CoinbaseDev we witnessed our first AI to AI crypto transaction,”* he wrote in his account at X. 

As Armstrong explained, one AI agent – a ‘bot’ designed to perform a specific task – used crypto tokens to interact with another AI agent and receive AI tokens. In addition, he noted that the main reason for the inefficiency of AI agents is that they lack transactional capabilities. Without a payment method, it is difficult for them to perform basic tasks, such as booking plane tickets or hotels, and even manage social media tasks, not to mention simple content creation, such as promoting posts with paid advertising.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Celsius Bankruptcy: A Comprehensive Guide To Calculating Your Losses (With Examples!),2024-09-11 14:29:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

when user login, will use bcrypt on the plaintext password and the stored salt value to make sure the hash match with the one in database.

file encryption:

Reddit,crypto,Poor man's OTP challenge,2024-09-12 11:59:16,"Hey folks,

As some of you here (rightly) question my cryptanalysis experience, in the context of the security and usefulness claims I make for the SKREM-like ciphers I had introduced in 2021, I thought I might challenge the community here with an apparently hard, but in fact rather easy problem. This is to both illustrate that I do have at least some insight into cipher analysis (although yeah, computational ciphers, cryptomath is not my strong point, nor does it need to be). And also to see if so called claimed more experienced people here can solve this.

So the problem is called Poor man's OTP and it is as follows:

- A poor man has 256 truly random One Time Pads, of large length.. say more than 4096 bits: o1, o2, .., o256.
- He wishes to encrypt 1024 bit long piece of plain text p, with a strong 256 bit private key k.
- He computes the poor man's OTP O follows: for each otp o_i, he XORs o_i with the current O if and only if the i-th bit of the key is 1. Basically, the key chooses one of 2^256 subsets of the set of otps, and XORs it's members together.
- He then XORs O with p and claims it is secure.

Let's brute force this under the most common and useful scenario: known plain text attack.

To brute force this, one would have to check each of 2^256 subsets since each yields a different OTP.

But I am pretty convinced I can do it in like 2*256^3 so like 2^25. Can you? Remeber, the key is that the otps are chosen truly randomly.

After a while with this post around, I will also post my solution.

Best,

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Reddit,crypto,Symmetric key exchange protocol,2024-09-07 17:55:12,"Hi folks,

I was trying to fill in the gap for use case for SKREM-like ciphers I posted about (which I invented and got peer reviewed in 2021). It's of course a symmetric key cipher. The only major thing lacking is bilateral key exchange over a public channel. Monkey in the middle I can prevent with Lamport-like digital signing.

So I was wondering if we can do any better than Meet in the Middle key exchange.

I think we can.. and I got this idea, based on There Pass Protocol.

1. Alice picks a truly random large master table g of size n bits (say 1 GB long). She also chooses truly randomly a permutation p of n elements, consisting of a single cycle of length n.
2. Alice sends Bob the master g table with the bits permuted by p.
3. Bob receives and further permutes by a permutation q also of n elements consisting of a single cycle of length n.
4. Bob sends to Alice the result.
5. Alice applies p^-1 to the message from Bob and sends to Bob.
6. Bob receives second message from Alice and applies q^-1.

Now both Bob and Alice have the same info on master table g. This is since such permutations comute.

Potentially, it can be combined with Meet in the Middle Key exchange, by encrypting  step 5 with the short key obtained by MIM KE.

Note that permutations are not themselves sent but just their application to the large GMT.

This looks pretty cool and maybe quite secure to me.. am I missing something? Why is this not in literature? Or is it?

Thanks!

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3.

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 18:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

Feel free to share your attempts and findings!

Originally I was told to refer to the Intel Manuals to learn more about cryptographic hardware extensions.

However I admit I have no experience in hardware RTL designs nor assembly. Plus Intel CPUs are proprietary and I can't just make edits to them without risking lawsuits (or worse). So I decided to pay attention to the RISC-V Cryptographic Hardware Extensions--which are open source.

How mature are these extensions? It doesn't look like they are production ready are they? What faults do you see in them compared to industrial strength CPUs cryptographic hardware extensions?",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232
Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 11:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 16:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code.

Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Reddit,crypto,Most Used Languages to Program Cryptography in Production?,2024-07-25 05:04:31,"Hello Everyone.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 16:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-14 12:15:38.295232

Reddit,crypto,What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,2024-07-21 12:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
