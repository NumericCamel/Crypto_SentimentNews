Here’s what the trend in an indicator suggests about what could be behind this downturn. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Gone Cold As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has returned to neutral levels recently. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This metric essentially tells us about how the buying or selling behaviours differ between the user bases of the two cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase’s main traffic is made up of American investors, especially large institutional entities, while Binance serves investors around the world. When the Coinbase Premium Gap has a positive value, it means the US-based whales are participating in a higher amount of buying or a lower amount of selling than the Binance users, which is why the asset is more expensive on Coinbase. Similarly, it being negative implies a net higher buying pressure on Binance. Related Reading: Chainlink May Reach New ATH If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Says Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past couple of days: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been at notable positive levels earlier, but during the past day, its value has declined to the neutral zero mark. According to Maartunn, the source of the positive premium was Microstrategy’s latest buying spree. Indeed, the cooldown in the indicator matches up with the timing of the completion of the $5.4 billion purchase by Michael Saylor’s firm. The significant accumulation from the company had helped the cryptocurrency maintain its recent highs, but with the buying pressure depleted, Bitcoin has retraced to price levels under $93,000. BTC and the Coinbase Premium Gap have held a close relationship throughout 2024, so the metric could be to keep an eye on in the near future, as where it goes next may once again foreshadow the asset’s next destination. Naturally, a decline into the negative region could spell further bearish action for its price. In some other news, the Bitcoin Active Addresses indicator has observed a sharp jump recently, as Maartunn has shared in another X post. This metric keeps track of the daily number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart shared by the CryptoQuant analyst for the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Active Addresses: With this latest surge, the 14-day SMA of the Bitcoin Active Addresses has reached its highest point in eleven months. This suggests that a lot of activity has recently occurred on the network. Given that the asset has gone down in the past day, though, the most recent user interest has certainly not come for buying. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $92,400, down almost 6% over the last 24 hours.

He emphasized the growing institutional interest and a favorable regulatory environment that could propel the BTC price to new highs. Thiel dismissed the impact of the recent Bitcoin halving, stating, “I think the halving had zero effect.” Instead, he attributed the Bitcoin price surge to the introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year. “In January, you had the ETFs that launched that drove all of a sudden the beginnings of some institutional interest,” he noted. Institutions Just ‘Waiting To Buy Up’ Bitcoin While the initial investments in these ETFs were predominantly retail, Thiel observed a shift as institutional players began entering the market. “Then you started seeing some pension funds starting to buy into ETFs and into Bitcoin-related equities like our stock or MicroStrategy‘s,” he added. The CEO highlighted the potential impact of political developments on the BTC market. “With the election, you know, Donald Trump ran on a platform that is very pro-Bitcoin—Bitcoin strategic reserve, mining in the US, etc.,” Thiel said. He suggested that such a stance could lead to a more supportive regulatory environment in the United States. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Pauses Before $100K—Here’s What Could Happen Next “What that’s ended up driving is a huge belief that all of a sudden the regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto will get much better, that the US will double down and really invest in Bitcoin potentially,” he explained. This anticipated shift could pressure other nations to adopt similar policies, fostering global adoption. Thiel also pointed out the robust market dynamics absorbing selling pressure from long-term holders. “Every single Bitcoin that had been purchased was in profit, and you started long-term holders who had held Bitcoin for years beginning to liquidate a little bit to take some profits,” he said. Despite this, he emphasized the market’s resilience: “There is so much demand in the market that it just keeps soaking it up.” Addressing concerns about Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, Thiel asserted that significant drawdowns might be a thing of the past, at least in the near term. “The volatility of past years, where you would hit a peak and then see a 20% or 30% drawdown, I think are gone, at least for the near-term future,” he stated. He believes that institutional investors are poised to enter the market aggressively. “I think what we’re going to see is essentially institutions just waiting to buy up Bitcoin,” Thiel predicted. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained He cited recent actions by major corporations to support his outlook. “You look at MicroStrategy—they’re [issuing a] $3 billion bond; they’re out there buying Bitcoin very aggressively,” he said. “We raised a $1 billion bond at 0% coupon the same week as Michael Saylor did, and we went out and acquired hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin.” Thiel emphasized that this trend is gaining momentum: “Lots of people are starting to do this now.” Concluding his insights, Thiel expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. “Anybody who’s selling is selling into a market where there’s ample demand, and I think that for the foreseeable future we’ll continue to see Bitcoin price move up—you know, up and down, up and down—but generally the trend will be upwards,” he said. Notably, Cantor Fitzgerald recently adjusted its price target for MARA from $33 to $42. The revision follows Mara Holdings’ completion of a substantial $1 billion convertible note offering last week. From the $980 million raised, Mara used $199 million to buy back $222 million in principal of its 2026 convertible notes. With $781 million in proceeds remaining, the company plans to purchase additional Bitcoin, leveraging a strategy similar to MicroStrategy (MSTR). However, unlike MicroStrategy, which focuses purely on capital market maneuvers to accumulate Bitcoin, Mara also operates the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining operation by hash rate. Analysts at Cantor highlight this as a key differentiator with bullish potential. At press time, BTC traded at $92,531.

Shedding light on Dogecoin’s future bullish trajectory, a crypto analyst has discussed the importance of the $0.22 50-day Moving Average (MA) in determining the Dogecoin price movements in this bull cycle. How The 50-Day MA Impacts The Dogecoin Price Rally The 50-day MA is a technical indicator that highlights a cryptocurrency’s average price over the last 50 trading days. It is primarily used to identify price trends, determine resistance and support levels, and generate buy and sell signals. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Remain Greedy Amid Price Break Toward $100,000, Why This Is Good Kevin, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has underscored the significance of this critical technical indicator in the recent Dogecoin price movements and its influence on the meme coin’s future bull rally. The analyst disclosed that historically, during Dogecoin’s previous bull markets, its price consistently stayed above the 50-day MA, never losing this crucial threshold despite testing it multiple times. Typically, staying above the 50-day MA is seen as a bullish indicator, while consistently dropping below this average suggests a downtrend.  Presenting a detailed chart of Dogecoin’s price action in the last bull cycle in late 2020 to date, Kevin disclosed that the current 50-day MA for the meme coin is at $0.22. However, this price threshold is rising quickly as Dogecoin closes each daily candle. Additionally, the rapid increase suggests that if Dogecoin can remain steady around or above the 50-day MA, its price should see a significant bullish trend continuation, providing a strong foundation for even higher prices.   Dogecoin Enters Distribution Phase, $9.5 Target In Sight In a different X post, Trader Tardigrade, a prominent crypto market expert, declared that Dogecoin has officially entered the Distribution phase in the classic Power of Three (PO3) market cycle. The PO3 cycle is a popular concept in technical analysis used to identify key market phases — Accumulation, Distribution, and Manipulation. Related Reading: Over $500 Million Wiped Out From The Market As Bitcoin Price Fluctuates Heavily With Dogecoin now firmly in the Distribution phase, large holders may be offloading their assets, potentially locking in profits following DOGE’s recent price increase. While the distribution phase could be seen as the end of a bull rally characterized by sell-offs and slow momentum, Trader Tardigrade believes that this phase could be calm before a massive price surge.  The analyst shared two price charts comparing Dogecoin’s movements during the bull cycle between 2016 and 2017 and its future price action in 2024 and 2025. In the 2017 bull market, Dogecoin entered a distribution phase, which led to a significant bull rally to new levels above $0.00066.  If this trend holds true for Dogecoin’s current distribution phase, Trader Tardigrade has predicted that its price could surge as high as $9.5 from its current value of $0.4.

This marks a major turning point for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The coin rose more than 5% in a single day, reaching $3,525, and has gained 38% in the last 30 days.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 70, indicating heavy buying pressure. Furthermore, ETH has broken its 30- and 200-period moving averages, strengthening its bullish trend. Titan of Crypto noted an interesting development: a weekly closure higher than the Kumo Cloud. With a probable second aim of $4,862 should momentum continue, this technical breakout projects ETH might soon test resistance levels near $4,189. #Altcoins #Ethereum Golden Cross Incoming 🚀#ETH has closed above the weekly Kumo Cloud: an important milestone. This breakout could pave the way to $4,100 next! 🎯 pic.twitter.com/q0eOVgxgnU — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) November 25, 2024 The upside would get further boosted with an upcoming Golden Cross, in which the shorter-term moving average will cross above the longer-term one. In fact, this has historically led to very strong price rallies. If such bullish signs are accompanied by sustained buying activity, ETH may approach these higher price levels in the near term. Ethereum Fundamentals Remain Solid Beyond the technical prowess, Ethereum shines still through its strong dominance in decentralized finance, or DeFi, and a myriad of blockchain applications. The network holds more than half of the total value locked into DeFi, so it is surely pertinent to the ecosystem. Furthermore, the emergence of ETH-based layer-2 solutions increases their scalability and appeal to both developers and users. Meanwhile, activity in the Ethereum derivatives market is soaring. Open interest has topped $20 billion, with traders eyeing $3,400 and $3,500 for options that expire soon. Increased transaction volumes per block are also driving up fees, lowering ETH’s circulating supply and potentially raising prices even further. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ATH Sparks $309 Price Prediction Frenzy – Details Room For growth amidst optimism While Ethereum’s price has increased by 66% in the previous year, many analysts say it remains undervalued. Predictions of a gain above $4,800 this cycle indicate the market’s belief in ETH’s future. At the same time, if pro-crypto legislation passes in the US, it could speed up the rise of crypto even more. Ethereum looks like it will go up, maybe even to new all-time highs, because its fundamentals are strong, it is becoming more popular, and its technical setup is good.

However, after reaching a multi-year high of $1.15, the cryptocurrency is now navigating a 17% correction as profit-taking sets in. Despite the pullback, the long-term outlook for Cardano remains bullish, fueled by renewed market momentum over the past three weeks. The price action reflects a maturing market, with ADA consolidating gains and building a foundation for its next move. On-chain data from IntoTheBlock highlights robust growth in network activity, signaling increased interest and adoption. This uptick in activity suggests that the consolidation phase could be temporary as the broader market gains strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation? Cardano’s ability to maintain key support levels during this correction will be crucial in determining its next direction. Analysts are optimistic that the network’s growing fundamentals and favorable macro environment will drive ADA to new heights.  As traders and investors monitor the $1 support level closely, Cardano’s evolving network metrics and bullish sentiment hint at a potential breakout shortly. Whether ADA’s price action will capitalize on these factors remains a key question for market participants. Cardano Daily Active Addresses Growing Cardano’s network activity shows strong growth signs, with daily active addresses increasing significantly. On-chain data from IntoTheBlock reveals that the number of new user addresses has reached its highest since June 2023. This surge in network activity signals growing adoption and increased interest in the Cardano ecosystem, which is crucial for its long-term development. Over the weekend, Cardano reclaimed the $1 level, marking an important psychological milestone. While the price is currently consolidating, this movement comes amid a surge in network growth, indicating that market participants remain optimistic about ADA’s future. IntoTheBlock’s analysis on X suggests that Cardano could be preparing for a bullish breakout, with the potential to rise to new price levels as the current consolidation phase stabilizes. Despite the recent pullback from its multi-year high of $1.15, Cardano is still well-positioned for further growth. ADA remains more than 230% away from its all-time high (ATH), around $3.1, suggesting significant room for upside as the network matures and attracts more users. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Benefits From US Buyers – Coinbase Premium Gap Reveals Strong Demand If the price maintains support above the $1 level and network growth continues to trend upwards, Cardano could be primed for its next bullish move. With the growing number of daily active addresses and a significant gap to its ATH, the potential for a strong rally remains intact. Investors are watching closely to see if Cardano can sustain this momentum and capitalize on the surging network activity in the coming months. ADA Demand Remains Strong Cardano is trading at $0.93 after an impressive 250% run from November 5 to its yearly high of $1.15. The price has since retraced more than 17% since Saturday morning’s peak, as it now attempts to find strong demand above the $0.90 level. This retracement is part of the natural consolidation process following a sharp rally, and ADA must hold above $0.90 to maintain bullish momentum. If ADA manages to hold above this level, it could position itself for a potential breakout, with the next key supply levels lying above $1.25. Such a move would indicate that the current pullback is simply a healthy correction before another leg up. However, if ADA loses the $0.90 level and fails to reclaim support, a deeper correction could follow, potentially bringing ADA to test lower levels. In that case, the next critical support zone would likely be closer to the $0.80 mark, where ADA might find further demand. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour Overall, ADA’s price action remains bullish in the longer term, but it needs to maintain support above the $0.90 mark to continue its upward trajectory and reach new supply levels above $1.25.

In line with this, crypto analyst Tony Severino provided insights into what could come next for Bitcoin.  What Next For Price After Close Above Bull Channel In an X post, Tony Severino mentioned that the Bitcoin price is now retesting the median in the bull channel, with an evening star pattern forming on the chart, which hints at a potential reversal. He noted that Bitcoin is fighting to stay above the $96,000 range, which could invalidate this sell signal.  Related Reading: Over $500 Million Wiped Out From The Market As Bitcoin Price Fluctuates Heavily However, if Bitcoin closes below this median range, Tony Severino warns that the price could record a significant downtrend to the $90,000 range. If this median range holds, the crypto analyst expects Bitcoin to break into the upper channel above the $100,000 level.  Tony Severino revealed that the target for this uptrend channel is $267,000. However, he doesn’t think the Bitcoin price will reach that level in this bull run. Instead, the crypto analyst predicts that Bitcoin could peak between $160,000 and $190,000, although Severino is more confident about the former being the market top.  The crypto analyst added that the golden ratio is in the $160,000 range, which makes this target more feasible. He also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price eventually rallying to $169,000 as it peaks in this range. Amid this analysis, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin is currently at risk of dropping to this $90,000, having failed to hold the median at the $96,000 range.  The $94,000 Range Is Another Level To Watch Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently suggested that the $94,000 range is another level to watch for the Bitcoin price. According to him, this is the key level that matters. He claimed that BTC is bullish on all timeframes as long as the flagship crypto stays above this level. However, if Bitcoin loses this level, it could lead to a significant downtrend.  Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Remain Greedy Amid Price Break Toward $100,000, Why This Is Good CrediBULL Crypto stated that a break below $94,000 will indicate a momentum shift and a potential larger correction that could cause Bitcoin price to drop to the low $80,000 range. The positive is that investors still look heavily bullish on Bitcoin’s trajectory despite a potential price correction on the horizon.  In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that investors are buying the dip. This came as he revealed that the percentage of all traders with long Bitcoin positions has increased from 45.36% to 55.93%.  At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $94,800, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Holds At $93,257 As Bulls Struggle To Avoid Deeper Losses",2024-11-26 15:00:21+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) stands firm at $93,257, a crucial support level that could determine its next major move. As the battle between bulls and bears intensifies, the stakes are high: a successful defense could spark renewed momentum, while a break below might trigger significant losses.  As the market navigates this pivotal moment, this article aims to analyze BTC’s current position at the critical $93,257 support level, exploring the factors influencing its price movement. By examining key technical indicators and market dynamics, the goal is to assess whether the bulls can defend this level and potentially drive a rebound or if a break below could cause deeper losses. Analyzing The Recent Price Action Of Bitcoin Bitcoin is facing a bearish trend, attempting to break below the $93,257 support level. If this continues, BTC could test the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, which could act as support or signal further weakness. A failure to hold above this level might lead to a deeper correction and possibly more notable losses toward lower support zones. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis shows that BTC may continue its decline, as the RSI has dropped to 35%, indicating increasing selling pressure. A reading below 50% suggests a weakening bullish trend and raises the likelihood of more declines. If the RSI continues to dip, it could signal that Bitcoin is entering a prolonged bearish phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Pauses Before $100K—Here’s What Could Happen Next Despite trading above the key 100-day SMA, Bitcoin is showing strong negative momentum on the daily chart, highlighted by bearish candlesticks and increasing selling pressure. This suggests that the crypto asset is struggling to sustain its upward strength, and if the downtrend continues, it may lead to large corrections and test lower support levels. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart has dropped to 63% from the overbought zone, signaling a shift in market sentiment. This implies that buying pressure is easing, and the bullish momentum may be weakening. A move away from the overbought area could signal the start of a consolidation phase or the onset of a corrective pullback. Potential Scenarios: Rebound Or Breakdown? As Bitcoin tests key support levels, a rebound or a breakdown is expected. Thus, if the bulls manage to defend critical levels like $93,257, BTC witness a rebound, gaining upside strength and targeting its previous high of $99,575. Furthermore, a break above this level may pave the way for the digital asset to set new highs, extending the bullish trend.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Leverage Remains High – Data Reveals Selling Pressure Above $93K,2024-11-26 13:30:15+00:00,"After a historic rally, Bitcoin has faced its first major setback, pulling back 7% from its all-time high of $99,800. This comes after an impressive surge from $67,500 on November 5, marking a nearly 50% climb in just a few weeks. The price action has largely been “only up,” attracting significant attention from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance However, the current pullback highlights growing caution in the market. Market caution said leverage levels remain elevated despite recent deleveraging efforts. Adler’s analysis reveals that increasing short positions and consolidation below the psychological $100,000 mark have contributed to the retracement. While Bitcoin’s performance remains strong in the broader context, this dip signals a potential shift in market sentiment. The question is whether BTC can gather enough momentum to break past the $100,000 barrier or if further consolidation is on the horizon. Many investors consider this pullback a healthy pause in a bullish cycle, but the high leverage levels suggest continued volatility. All eyes are on Bitcoin as it navigates this critical phase, with the next few days likely to determine its short-term direction. Bitcoin Bears Showing Up After three weeks of minimal resistance from bears, signs of their resurgence emerge as Bitcoin struggles to break past the $100,000 level. This critical price point, which many believed would act as a springboard for further gains, has instead highlighted growing bearish sentiment. According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, the recent price action marks a potential shift in momentum. Adler’s analysis on X reveals that despite a wave of recent deleveraging, leverage levels in the market remain elevated. Many key long positions were established around the $93,000 mark, providing bears with an opportunity to profit as BTC failed to push higher. This level has now become a battleground, with Bitcoin’s inability to sustain upward momentum signaling the possibility of further downside risk. Bitcoin’s price hovers around this key level, raising the likelihood of a correction toward $88,500 or prolonged sideways consolidation below $100,000. Such a scenario would impact Bitcoin and set the tone for altcoin performance in the coming weeks. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Sets $2 Target If It Holds Key Level – Can It Reach Multi-Year Highs? The next two weeks will be pivotal as market participants closely watch Bitcoin’s price action. A decisive move, whether up or down, will shape the broader cryptocurrency landscape and determine whether this is merely a pause in a larger rally or the start of a deeper correction. BTC Testing Fresh Demand Bitcoin is trading at $93,500 as bears regained control after it hit an all-time high last Friday. This retracement marks a shift in momentum, but bulls still can reclaim dominance if the price remains strong above the critical $92,000 support level. Holding this level would keep Bitcoin’s price action structurally bullish and signal resilience in the face of increased selling pressure. If Bitcoin sustains strength above $92,000, the outlook for the short term remains optimistic, with the potential for another attempt at breaking key resistance levels. However, a drop below this mark would signal short-term weakness, potentially triggering further declines. The next critical level to watch would be around $84,000, where the 4-hour 200 EMA aligns as a support zone. This level represents a major line in the sand for bulls. A breakdown below it could accelerate bearish momentum, extending the correction and dampening market sentiment. On the other hand, holding above $92,000 would reinforce bullish confidence, setting the stage for a recovery and a potential pushback toward previous highs.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over? Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible",2024-11-26 12:00:02+00:00,"The Bitcoin price could crash if it fails to hold key resistance levels. A crypto analyst has revealed that a decline to $89,000 was well within possibility, as sell-offs below the $100,000 mark have continued to hinder Bitcoin’s price upward momentum.  Bitcoin Price Correction To $89,000 Possible On November 26, TradingView crypto analyst Pejman Zwin shared a detailed chart representing a technical analysis of Bitcoin‘s price movements in a 1-hour time frame. The Bitcoin price chart highlighted vital resistance lines, support zones, and technical indicators suggesting an impending crash.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Extends Rally – Can This Lead To A Breakout Above $0.82? At the top of the price chart is a yellow zone identified as the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ), where Bitcoin is expected to face significant resistance as it aims for the $100,000 milestone. The chart also highlights a horizontal resistance line of around $95,904, which Bitcoin previously struggled to break. At current resistance levels between $97,000 and $98,000, Zwin has indicated that if Bitcoin can successfully push above these thresholds, its price could rise significantly towards $100,000. On the other hand, Bitcoin could experience a massive price decline if it fails to reach the resistance levels mentioned above. The analyst’s price chart showcases green zones representing critical support cones where Bitcoin could bounce back if its price corrects.  If Bitcoin drops below support levels between $95,600 and $92,000 and breaks the lower line of the ascending channel on its chart, Zwin has forecasted that its price could crash as low as $89,000 this bull cycle. The analyst describes this crash point as the “cumulative long liquidation leverage, where Bitcoin could see its price correcting between $91,000 and $89,000, representing an 8% to 10% crash for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Key Factors Pushing The BTC Price Upwards On the flip side, Zwin disclosed in his Bitcoin analysis report that the cryptocurrency is pumping again, driven by a wave of positive market sentiment sparked by recent developments in the crypto space that have been headlines. The analyst revealed that the news of the Chinese Court affirming the legality of Bitcoin and crypto ownership has been a key catalyst behind the sharp rise in the price of BTC. Related Reading: ETH/BTC’s 8-Year Cycle Chart Shows How High Ethereum Price Can Go This Cycle Additionally, Donald Trump‘s plans to appoint a White House crypto advisor have provided a significant boost to the BTC price, propelling it to current levels and enabling it to break through important resistance lines.  Based on the above chart, Zwin reveals that Bitcoin has entered five new impulsive waves from the Elliott wave theory. This bullish development occurred after the cryptocurrency broke past key resistance lines.  Moreover, Zwin’s Bitcoin price chart showcases a “Bump and Run Top Pattern,” with the cryptocurrency already completing the “Bump phase” and entering a “Run phase.” Taking this into consideration, the analyst has predicted that if Bitcoin can surge above $98,700, investors and market watchers should expect it to skyrocket to $100,000.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Top 5 Crypto PR Agencies,2024-11-26 11:02:14+00:00,"If you’re trying to navigate the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, you’ll need a PR agency. In the best of times, you need a media partner to get your business’s name out there and keep it in the minds of customers. In the worst of times, you’ll need an agency that knows the market and can help you come out unscathed.  The crypto agency space is perhaps as oversaturated as the crypto space itself and this presents a unique challenge; how do you tell the best PR agencies? Not to worry because, in this list, we’ve outlined the top 5 crypto OR agencies to consider.   1. Proleo.io     As one of the most respected crypto PR agencies in the business, Proleo.io has racked up almost as many awards as it has clients.

The agency has completed over 241 projects and has been operating for years. Among the services it offers are PR strategy, content creation, and targeted engagement. Some of the clients in its impressive roster include OKX and Telus, though the agency prides itself on servicing all areas of the blockchain space. For achieving a balance between professionalism and a personal touch, it is one to watch.   2. Blockman.pro     Blockman.pro immediately stands out from the crowd thanks to its network of media partners, which clocks in at over 200. On top of this, the agency handles PR distribution in several different ways. Those who want traditional distribution can easily tap into this network and have their needs met. Those on a tight schedule can take advantage of flash news distribution that gets them seen quickly and effectively. There is also more organic reach that carefully crafts a public image for the brand. And believe us, many brands have turned to the agency for help, including Hedera and Bitget.   3. Crypto Virally      True to its name, Crypto Virally specializes in helping businesses hack into digital relevance and they do this through a combination of mainstream and crypto-specific publications. A quick look at its packages will see platforms like Yahoo! And Reuters alongside top crypto sites like MarketWatch and Benginza. With packages as affordable as $500 and as high as $20,000, all ambition levels are being catered to. Crypto Virally also boasts publication partners like UToday and NewsBTC. While all businesses have their unique approaches to garnering attention, Crypto Virally has made a name for itself in hard-hitting and aggressive market penetration, which will come in handy for newer enterprises.    4. Reblonde     Reblonde is one of the most respected PR services in the industry and cuts across crypto, web3, NFTs, and much more. With over a decade under its belt, the agency offers guidance on every level of the crypto PR distribution process. They help to develop the strategy to be used by the business, crafting a voice that is unique and speaks to their audience. Then, the agency helps with the creation of the press release itself and makes sure that the message isn’t lost in translation. Finally, the agency leverages its extensive network of publications to make sure it is well-placed. Blonde might be pricier than others on the list but they work only with the best of the best.    5. FinPR   For a lot of businesses, crypto PRs aren’t being released just for themselves but in a bid to court mainstream attention. It is good for them that FinPR offers both PR distribution as well as editorial services. The latter works to get the attention of crypto and mainstream news sites and this baked into the former. FinPR boasts of being able to get customers featured on sites like Cointelegraph, Bitcoinist, NewsBTC, CoinDesk, Decrypt. This, along with the copywriting services they offer, means that businesses looking to develop long-term brand awareness will benefit from FinPR’s strategy.

From traditional PR distribution to influencer marketing and everything in between, any business wanting to be seen should definitely consider them. Their services will benefit businesses in the NFT space, the crypto industry, and all things blockchain. With years of experience and award-winning campaigns under their belt, they stand out from the crowd.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,solana,Solana Utility Project,2024-11-26 20:56:27,"Hi all,

Wanted to share with you a utility project on Solana that has been holding quite well recently leading up to its anticipated utility release which is right around the corner. 

The project is called TokenJungle and its aim is to make launching and managing a crypto project as user friendly as possible. 

It features a token minting tool, a launchpad for getting your token on Raydium, as well as several other useful tools that you can check out as well including a volume bot, rank bot, reaction bot, etc. 

There will also be a 50% discount on using the tools up to December 15th in case anybody wants to try to create a project with their tools. 

The project has been around for a little over a month now and is currently sitting at about 400K MC.

I believe this could be a potential gem if you're in the market for a solid utility project to invest in.

Reddit,solana,Losing all your money to memecoins?  The problem may be that you're bringing a knife to a bot fight.,2024-11-26 00:18:48,"I've been around awhile, and recently moved from ETH to SOL. The first thing I noticed was that SOL charts just didn't add up. Too many dips turned to capitulation, too many non-sensical buys and sells. So I started researching....

I think maybe people don't realize how big the bot problem is on Solana. Tbf, no one does. The pseudonymous nature of the blockchain makes it nearly impossible to judge. But we know it's bad, so here's a post on why bots may be harvesting you for liquidity.

First, the types of bots we're talking about:

1. Front-Running Bots: Spot big buys and jump in first to profit.
2. Sandwich Bots: Abuse slippage, effectively rob you by buying before your transaction and selling right after
3. Sniping Bots: Buy before you and then sell to you at a higher price—some of you probably use these
4. Trend Bots: Spot breakouts or patterns on charts and act fast. These are stealthy.
5. Scam Bots: Manipulate the market to suppress price movement.
6. Chart Painting Bots: Fake trends on charts to trick investors into buying.

\-------------

**How do we know bots are so common?**

Well, if you designed a blockchain optimized for hosting bots and hiding their activity, it would probably look a lot like Solana. Low fees, no tax, a confusing blockchain structure, no penalties, and tons of highly volatile coins make it a literal botters paradise. I'm fairly confident there's not a blockchain more suited for bots.

**How bad is it?**

• In March 2024, during Solana’s frequent outages, 93% of failed transactions were from bots.

• \*\*In July, Solana had 1.3 million active wallets vs. Ethereum’s 300,000. The average Solana wallet had 217 transactions, compared to less than 3 on Ethereum.\*\*

• Many who have dived into this issue believe that Solana's meteoric rise has been mostly bot-driven.

**Why don’t you notice them?**

You do. You see it all the time, you just don't know how to spot it. This is speculation, but those big price swings that's earned SOL users the rep for dumping could be bots triggering each other’s stop-losses in a chain reaction.

And those “Bump bots” that keep tokens visible on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) that everyone says are required to launch mooners? Well, a flood of transactions with little price movement often signals a breakout, which makes it kinda likely that bump bots are false-triggering short term trading bots, and that's where the extra volume comes from.

\----------

It's very possible, maybe even probable, that the reality of the situation is that we're in an automated high-tech Bot vs Bot meatgrinder, with the equivalent of a slingshot to defend ourselves.

The memecoin game is ruthless, and it’s not just you versus other traders—it’s you versus devs, influencers, and an entire army of bots, all fighting for the same scraps. when you factor in how much bots can manipulate everything from prices to volume, it’s no wonder the odds feel stacked against you.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

I decided to look at it from the perspective of someone who's launching a coin themselves, and was wondering if someone can share their experience/thoughts from point of view of both token originator and investor. 

Obviously everyone in this space are trying to make money on coin pumping. How do you do that as an owner though? Ex. if you keep 5-10% of the token after moving everything to LP and burning it. Do you just break down your sell orders in smaller batches if you wanna offload 1% of your holdings so not to impact other people? 

Even example with $SSSSSS, top holder has 5% of the coins value at \~1M, I'd assume if they decide to offload some of it or most of it, it would take them forever?

The problem is that memecoins, especially very early on after they're created, don't have enough historical data and obvious patterns for predicting the market cap of it. My plan was to train the model on previously successful and unsuccessful coins and analyze the OHLCV, trade volume, liquidity, etc though I don't know if this method will work.

Has anyone tried something like this before? Curious to hear how successful or unsuccessful this strategy is.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,solana,Phanton and Metamask Hacked and Drained,2024-11-26 23:25:37,"So both my phantom and metamask wallets have been drained. I am new to crypto and luckily it was $900 and could have been worse.

The only thing I can recall is using the rugpull website a week ago and not being able to connect my wallets and then entering my seed phrases for both of these which funnily enough I still couldn't connect the wallets. Do you think this is most likely how my funds were drained? The only other thing I can think of was connecting my metamask wallet to uniswap and not disconnecting. I also connected my phantom wallet to GMGN.ai

I have most of my funds on Kraken, so I am concerned that this might be compromised also? I have changed password and enabled 2FA and ordered a cold wallet. 

I guess I want to use phantom/metamask again but now I'm a bit anxious/concerned. What is the safest way for me to setup new wallets and things that I should avoid?

I am genuinely curious where this falls in the grey area. Sure there's a degree of market manipulation but if you have a legit project it does help on the marketing side. You are attracting bigger players to your coin, etc etc. 

Reading up online, investopedia has the closest article I've found describing volume bots as wash trading but it seems to be lacking details with nuances of crypto trading.

Did i make a mistake? I Should have taken 75% out instead?

Out of pure luck, the coin did a 2x again. So I sold 50% again. So now basically I took my inițial 7$ out and i have 7$ profit.

Now I want to let the remaining 7$ in, and see what happens.

The reason for the post is, theres rarely a time a coin does 2x and then another 2x again, so I wanna make sure my strategy is right, for my future trading. I dont think its right that I need a 4x to have 100% profit of what i invested.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

He told me he earns money from it, and I saw his earnings—about $650 from Telegram airdrops. That’s a huge amount for me since I’m from India, and he uses only free methods to earn this.

So, I joined Telegram airdrops like TapTap projects and completed projects like Hamster, X Empir, Rocky Rabbit, and Major. Currently, I’m working on Blum, ToMarket, and a few others.

From my experience, I’ve realized that these projects aren’t necessarily bad, but they heavily favor people who can pay for stars or TON. While I’m not accusing them of being unfair, it’s clear that paying users have an advantage, which makes the system feel unequal for others, like everyone is working here and contributing something they should pay something for that but the payment is too low for what are we working for.

Recently, my friend told me that Telegram-based projects aren’t as rewarding anymore. He recommended trying testnet and DeNet projects instead. I’ve started exploring some DeNet projects, but I also want to properly understand how all these things work. I’m curious about:

What blockchain is and how it works.

What is memepad

What is solana and ton ecosystem 

What is pocektfi, how it works

# [Feature Gate Spotlight: Timely Vote Credits](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/feature-gate-spotlight-timely-vote-credits)

### Summary

Timely Vote Credits (TVC) refers to a new feature designed and approved by Solana validator operators to incentivize validators to submit consensus votes in a timely manner. To do accomplish this goal, TVC will award extra vote ""credits"" to validators whose votes are included in blocks with relatively low latency. Earned vote credits are directly tied to the proportion of inflation rewards that are awarded to validators.

### Motivation

Before the activation of this new feature, validators have always earned a full vote credit for each correct vote as long as their vote was received within approximately 2.5 minutes after the voted block was produced. This has led to some validators lagging their consensus votes to earn more vote credits by waiting until the supermajority confirms a block. This avoids the opportunity cost of voting on a block that was not confirmed. This behavior hurts consensus because as more validators lag their votes, confirmation latency gets worse. In the worst case, everyone is waiting for everyone else to make the first move and a supermajority can never be reached to confirm blocks.

### Implementation

When recording votes, the vote program will record the slot difference of the voted slots and the slot of the block the votes were recorded in. For every recorded vote that gets rooted, the amount of awarded vote credits is a function of slot latency. There is a grace period of 2 slots meaning that votes with a slot latency of 2 slots or less will receive the maximum of 16 credits. Each additional slot of latency will result in a deduction of 1 vote credit down to a minimum of 1 credit per rooted vote.

##### Aside: How Do Vote Credits Map to Inflation Rewards?

The goal of inflation reward distribution is to deliver rewards to each delegated stake account proportionally to how many credits the delegated vote account earned as well as the amount of actively delegated stake. So at the end of each epoch, the Solana protocol calculates ""reward points"" for each actively delegated stake account by multiplying the stake delegation amount by the amount of vote credits earned by their delegated vote account. Each epoch, the amount of total distributed inflation rewards is calculated by multiplying the latest inflation rate by the amount of active stake in the network. This amount is then distributed to validators in proportion to each active stake account's earned reward points.

If every validator earned the exact same number of vote credits, inflation rewards would be distributed proportionally to active stake. But even before activating TVC there has actually been quite a bit of vote credit variance across each cluster due to how accurately each validator votes on confirmed blocks. There are consensus rules against voting on competing forks, so if a validator votes on a fork that isn't confirmed, their incorrect vote causes them to miss the vote credits on the correct fork until they're allowed to switch back to the correct fork. With TVC, an extra dimension of vote latency is taken into consideration and the amount of vote credits earned for each vote depends on how soon after the voted block the vote was included. So for example, let's say Validator A votes slowly and often votes on the wrong fork while Validator B votes quickly and accurately. Validator B will earn proportionally more vote credits than Validator A and so any stake delegated to validator A will be distributed a higher reward rate on their delegated stake than stake delegated to validator A.

### Expectations

##### Faster Confirmation Times

Once a block has been fully produced, validators have less than a second to receive, validate, and vote on the produced block to earn full vote credits.

This has a few implications:

1. **Validators have to validate produced blocks very quickly**

Validators running on slow hardware will struggle to validate blocks fast enough to vote with low enough latency to earn full vote credits.

Validators who optimize block validation by improving transaction processing scheduling algorithms will be able to submit their votes sooner.

1. **Validators can no longer lag their votes for multiple slots**

Some validators have been using different voting behavior modifications that lag their votes to ensure that they earn optimal vote credits. This strategy will no longer be viable once TVC is enabled if the lagging would cause their votes to have latency that is too high.

1. **Validators need to ensure their votes are delivered**

It's not always straightforward to know which leader is current producing the next block that will be confirmed by consensus, especially during times of forking.

Vote transactions are primarily delivered over UDP to the current leader. Packet loss could therefore impact latency.

### Concerns

##### Geographic Stake Centralization

Some validators located outside of North America and Europe will likely decide to move their servers closer to areas where stake is already concentrated to decrease network latency. This is obviously far from ideal. Core developers are considering reducing this centralization risk by increasing the slot latency grace period beyond the current configuration of 2 slots to give validators in sparse stake weight regions more time to send their votes.

##### Validator Stake Centralization

Validators are incentivized to include votes for higher staked nodes in their blocks first to increase the stake weight of their fork. This means that higher staked nodes will tend to have lower vote latency than other nodes. Again, this is the reason we have a grace period for vote inclusion.

##### Voting Censorship

Once TVC is enabled, block producers may be tempted to censor or delay votes to decrease the vote credits earned by their competitors. This temptation shouldn't be a big issue for several reasons. First, any leader who completely censors votes from being included in their blocks is forgoing the transaction fees for those vote transactions. Second, any leader who consistently delays votes from particular validators can be publicly shamed or retaliated against because this behavior is publicly observable onchain. Lastly, the actual impact of targeted censorship is fairly minimal. Votes can earn up to 16 credits for low latency inclusion and there is a grace period of a few slots. So even if a leader censors votes for a few slots, they will only lose a small portion of the total possible credits.

### How Can Validators Track Vote Latency?

The Vortex dashboard has features for analyzing the timely vote credits earned by each validator:

* [https://app.vx.tools/cluster/vote-stats](https://app.vx.tools/cluster/vote-stats)

### How Can Validators Improve Vote Latency?

##### Improve Replay Times

1. **Experiment with block verification methods.**

For example, the new ""unified scheduler"" is available for use on Agave v2 and can be enabled via the following CLI parameter:

agave-validator --block-verification-method unified-scheduler

1. **Upgrade and configure hardware**

Solana validator operators should ensure that they are running sufficiently performant hardware and that their validators are configured according to the latest recommendations.

1. **Use the default full snapshot interval**

The Agave validator client has degraded block production and validation during full snapshot creation but this affects all validators. If a validator uses a custom interval, their voting could be degraded when the rest of the cluster is validating and voting on blocks at normal speeds. Validators with a custom full snapshot interval should consider removing the following CLI parameter:

agave-validator --full-snapshot-interval-slots XXXX

##### Improve Vote Delivery

1. **Votes are sent over UDP and therefore do not receive acks**

Validators may want to consider resending votes every 100ms to ensure they weren't dropped. There is no Agave configuration parameter for this yet. PR's welcome!

1. **Send votes to the current leader**

Votes are ideally sent to the current leader but that's not always straightforward. Agave currently delivers votes by fanning them out over the next few expected leader slots. This behavior might not be sufficient. If validators find a more effective strategy or can collect some metrics on this, PR's are welcome!

##### Aside: How Do Vote Mods Earn More Vote Credits?

Several different categories of modified voting behaviors have been observed on mainnet. But before discussing those modifications, the Anza core dev team would like to warn validator operators against running unaudited code on mainnet. This has the potential to cause unrecoverable failures in their validators or lead to slashable actions.

###### Vote Lagging

The first category is vote lagging. Rather than using the default behavior of attempting to voting on the most-likely-to-be-confirmed fork, some validators have implemented mods that simply delay voting until the rest of the cluster has already confirmed a block. The benefit of this strategy is obvious, such validators never vote incorrectly and miss out on vote credits due to voting on an incorrect block. But the drawback is clear too: if enough validators lag their votes, eventually everyone will be waiting to see what everyone else will vote on and confirmation times get much worse which can even result in the cluster failing to reach consensus on any new blocks. This modification strategy is clearly bad for the Solana protocol and is why TVC was implemented. TVC is designed to penalize vote laggers by awarding proportionally fewer vote credits to votes that were received with a delay.

###### Vote Backfilling

The second category of modifications is vote backfilling. If for some reason a validator stops voting for awhile or falls behind the cluster, they may skip voting on quite a few blocks until they catch up. If a validator modifies their voting behavior, they can attempt to vote on past blocks that were already confirmed by the cluster in order to earn more credits. The stock Agave validator behavior is not optimized to do this sort of backfilling because it doesn't really improve the health of consensus on a cluster. By default, the Agave validator creates vote transactions with the ""recent blockhash"" set to the blockhash of the block they are voting on. Even if they are voting on a block which is recent enough to earn vote credits, the blockhash could be old enough that the transaction is dropped. In this type of situation, modified validators that fetch a recent blockhash have an opportunity to earn some vote credits that they otherwise would have missed. After TVC is activated, these extra vote credits will be pretty negligible but still offer a slight benefit to validators that implement this mod. But this category of modification has a roughly neutral effect on cluster consensus health since block finalization doesn't require validators to vote on each block in a fork, a vote on one block of a fork is effectively a vote on all ancestor blocks as well.

###### Vote Lockout Adjustments

The third category of modifications is vote lockout adjustments. To understand this class of modification, one must first understand how the ""tower"" data structure in Solana's [Tower BFT](https://docs.anza.xyz/implemented-proposals/tower-bft) algorithm works. Every time a vote is recorded in a validator's local tower structure, any ""expired"" votes are removed from the tower before pushing the new vote and these expired votes do not earn any credits. This behavior comes from the mechanism used to force validators to wait until votes on an incorrect fork expire before they're allowed to start voting on a competing fork. Vote recording on-chain is done essentially the same way as tower vote updates despite it being impossible to process a vote for a competing fork in a block produced on a separate fork. In order to avoid votes expiring, validators can choose to increase the lockout expiration time of their previous votes. By doing so, they are increasing their commitment to that fork in order to avoid missing out on credits.

###### Vote Accuracy

Lastly, we have modifications for vote accuracy. There are likely multiple strategies in use by different competing validators but the basic idea is that validators attempt to make a more informed decision on how likely a block will be confirmed or not. They could assign scores to different leaders and predict which slot leaders are likely to have their blocks skipped or confirmed based on the scores of the current and following block leaders. These types of modifications are likely (but not necessarily) helpful rather than harmful to consensus health as long as they don't involve lagging. Ideally some of these strategies are eventually upstreamed into the default voting heuristics to improve vote accuracy across the cluster.

### Upcoming Protocol Improvements

The Anza core dev team is also actively working on protocol improvements to help validators reduce their vote latency. Here are a few of the upcoming improvements that will be applied soon or are being considered for the future:

1. **Partitioned epoch rewards**

Epoch boundaries are notoriously slow but this affects every validator right now. Partitioned epoch rewards will help alleviate this slowness and should be activated soon.

1. **Faster snapshot creation**

Full snapshot creation is very compute and memory intensive and noticeably slows down block validation and confirmation times. Solana core developers are actively working on transitioning to a faster approach which can be followed on [SIMD-0125](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/125).

1. **Vote ingestion via QUIC**

This change is still in the proposal review process and can be followed on [SIMD-0195](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/195). The motivation for migrating to QUIC for vote ingestion is to improve vote delivery guarantees.

1. **Voting grace period increase**

This change has been proposed by a few folks in the Solana validator community. Due to increased network latency, he current grace period of 2 slots is seen as unfair to nodes located outside of North America and Europe.

1. **Vote credit algorithm improvements**

Due to the risk of validators running unaudited code to modify voting behavior, the Anza core dev team aims to improve the vote credit algorithm to eliminate the advantage of certain voting mods such as backfilling and lockout adjustments.

(ft Coin Nerds),2024-11-25 22:45:43,"Almost on the daily there are headlines about rugs and massive pumps occurring in the SOL DEFI space. In fact I believe SOL is one the driving narratives in this bull cycle outside of the massive industrial investment for BTC. The Defi space has even see 100 billion in revenue compared to ETH's 55 billion in the past month, fueling the ""SOL will flip ETH"" argument. The issue is that SOL DEFI is heavily fueled by DEGEN spending and this is bad look for investors or the average person who is just looking into crypto.

Reddit,solana,Telegram Scammers Draining My Solana. ,2024-11-25 22:32:50,"Alright, I've been trading for about a month, and learned a ton. Mostly what NOT to do. 

I've been trading using BullX, although I do my research using other platforms such as DEXscreener, X, and all that other stuff. 

However, my Telegram or BullX keep getting hacked. It has happened twice now in a short period of time. 

The FIRST time, I was BRAND NEW to crypto day trading. I was researching Solana coins, investing like .2 sol, getting rugged, all the dumb s\*\*\*, but I was just trying to learn. After some time, I made my first decent trade, it was a 5x. I made about 2 Sol profit, and was stoked. However, as soon as I got out of the trade, and went to bed, someone got into my BullX and added a withdrawal wallet before I could delete it. I woke up to everything being gone. So I took that as a learning opportunity. I realized the only way they must've gotten in was through an encrypted Telegram link off of a memecoins X, or DEX. So, I deleted my Telegram and wiped everything. 

The SECOND time, I made a new Telegram and a new BullX. I made sure to set up 2FA, hide all my info, create super strong passwords, etc. Also, now I knew what those f\*\*\*ers could do. I was always cautious of clicking Telegrams, and I never joined any without having some sort of authorization, etc. However, obviously I clicked something I shouldn't have, and they got in again. Although, this time my Telegram app on my phone would give me notifications for BullX. So I saw a new wallet was added, and it obviously wasn't mine so I deleted it. This happened about 10 times, they kept adding new ones, and I'd delete it. I had my wallet added, and they kept deleting MINE (so I couldn't withdraw my own Sol). So after a while, they said f\*\*\* it and put ALL of my Sol into a random low cap s\*\*\*coin. I think it must've been one they made, because they bought and sold until everything was gone, and periodically, matching the transactions from my account the Dev would buy and sell. So I think they were just farming me because they couldn't simply withdraw my Solana. Once everything was gone they added a wallet named ""you made me lose 1 solana on fees :("", and another named ""on telegram with @yasuke. My name is kevin saudi ura do"". 

So this f\*\*\*er stole around 6 Solana from my account the second time, and the first time they stole 3 Solana. Which isn't a lot but I know they do this all day. They probably steal hundreds of peoples' Solana. 

Anyways, I just wanted to make a post to let people know. There isn't any info out there I could really find about this. So be careful, don't click anything you don't 100% trust and know, and maybe don't use BullX or Telegram. 

I made a wallet called ""God knows what you did. I wish the best for you"" so, I hope he can really sit and think about what a f\*\*\* he is lol. God will judge him, not me. 

Alright, let me hear what you guys have to say!

Here's how it works.

>In a cowswap pseudo sandwich, mev bots are monitoring cowswap auction data, front running users before the auctions are completed... then selling after the auction is completed.

>It's not as great as a traditional sandwich bc it's a multiblock operation / bots do carry inventory risk... but when you know the future (what people are about to buy), it's pretty solid edge.

>How is this possible?  Well, the live auctions are available via a public api.  At the following endpoint, ANYONE can see user intents before solvers win competitions / execute orders.

>https://api.cow.fi/mainnet/api/v1/auction

>But if my intention was to buy fucking kekec... i'm going to resubmit my order right?  Well yeah that's what i did multiple times, and sure enough, this guy was ready to sell his front ran kekec the second my order actually executed.

>I tried to inform the cowswap team about this behavior because i've absolutely loved using the product over the past years... but the guy i spoke with was condescending and didn't seem to think this was an issue / shit on me because i hadn't put together a comprehensive report yet... but brother in christ, if the pending auction data is public... you know damn well that people are taking advantage of this.

I'm interested to hear people's opinions on this.

Reddit,ethereum,Best exchange to swap BTC to ETH,2024-11-25 18:18:30,"Hi everyone, I’m facing a bit of a challenge and would really appreciate your input.

I’ve been holding onto BTC for quite some time, mainly as a long-term store of value. Lately, though, I’ve been exploring Ethereum’s ecosystem and am fascinated by the staking opportunities and the diverse range of DeFi protocols. To take advantage of these, I’m considering converting some of my BTC into ETH, but I want to ensure the process is both secure and cost-efficient.

Here’s what’s most important to me:

1. **Security:** I’ve heard concerning stories about some platforms freezing assets or being hacked, so I’m prioritizing exchanges with a strong reputation for safety.
2. **Privacy:** While I value privacy, I’m open to light KYC requirements if needed. However, I’d prefer platforms where KYC isn’t mandatory for small-scale swaps.
3. **Fees:** I’d like to avoid excessive fees. Platforms with clear and reasonable fee structures are a big plus for me.

I’m debating whether to use a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase or opt for a decentralized solution. My hesitation with DEXs lies in potential slippage and overly complex interfaces. On the flip side, I’d prefer to limit the amount of personal information shared when using centralized platforms.

Do you have any recommendations for the best way to swap BTC for ETH based on these priorities? I’d love to hear your suggestions or experiences. Thanks in advance!",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,ethereum,How to auto invest paycheck into crypto?,2024-11-25 23:20:36,"Hello Everyone,

I’m looking to invest a portion of my W2 Salary every month into a crypto portfolio.

To preface I’m still starting out with crypto so apologies if I say something dumb.

Every month on the 30th, I get my W2 direct deposit. I recently decided I’d like to take a small portion (let’s say 5%) and have it equally distributed across 5-10 coins I choose from.

Examples are: BTC, ETH, XRP, UNI, LINK, ADA, DOT.

If I invest let’s say $1,000 every month, I would want it equally divided by the amount of coins in the portfolio. For example in this example $1,000 / 8 = $125.

So $125 coins into every coin on the 30th every month. And it just keeps doing this automatically every month without me managing it. Similar to savings accounts, ira, etc.

Is there a way to do so? Which platform is best to do this that ideally has the least fees as I’ll be doing this monthly for several coins. Is there a preferred platform for this type of crypto investing? So far I’m looking at Kraken Pro.

Thank you all for your help in advance! 😊

TLDR; Looking for platform to auto invest direct deposit salary into crypto portfolio across several coins I choose.

Reddit,ethereum,What Problem Does Ethereum Solve 2024 Edition,2024-11-24 17:28:17,"I've been following this space for about 9 years.

Enough that I threw in some dollars and kind of just never let my ETH's go since 2016, a small DCA and then discipline to forget about it. I remember at some point ETH2 really sketched me out, and at one point I was nose keep in the literature and really understood the mechanics of it. Because of ETH, I am independently wealthy and pursue my career/passions without restrictions. My family is forever thankful for buying into the *Vision* of ETH.

Grown up the last 9 years, and am super thankful for learning about these communities early in my life. But I have also lived in the real world, work in technology / cybersecurity, even employed at a fintech company that implemented a crypto currency adjacent technology for ledger tracking and tokenization enabled workloads - but it was 100% isolated, private, and used by the company - for the company - built on top of a fork of a now popular cryptocurrency.

From a real world applied problem solving standpoint, I'm not stuck on either of the following questions - independently, I have strong answers. But together, I simply don't.

Which leads me to the following:

1. What problem does ethereum solve, AND
2. How is solving that problem going to lead to a financial gain or profit in holding ETH

There is the *Vision* of Etherum, and then there is the *Applied* nature of Ethereum in the real world outside of internet forums, discord, trading apps and reddit.

Honestly, I don't think the answer in solving these problems leads to ETH becoming more valuable. In fact, I think the opposite is true - the value would either:

have to stabilize and maintain a very low price for adoption , or , the application of ETH would be by private blockchains running completely independently from the main net, and businesses, corporations and government institutions peering and partnering between each other.

Not looking to delve (yes, ChatGPT has taught me new words) into speculation and pricing and current market hysteria. That is for children.

The Ethereum community stands at a crossroads, yet it may not even realize it. Caught in the dazzling momentum of innovation, collaboration, and evolution, we risk forgetting the very foundation upon which this project was built: resilience. In our pursuit of agility, we may lose sight of a truth so fundamental it feels almost sacrilegious to say aloud:

**Ethereum needs to die to truly live.**

Not literally, of course, but in spirit. To fulfill its promise as the ""Internet of Value,"" Ethereum must embrace ossification as its ultimate goal. The base layer should become boring, invisible, and irrelevant to daily conversation—not because it has failed, but because it has succeeded so completely that it no longer requires attention. The irony is sharp: the greatest triumph of a decentralized system is the irrelevance of its community.

**The Case for Ossification**

Imagine a world where no one argues over the TCP/IP stack anymore. Why? Because it works. It's reliable, unchanging, and trusted to the point of invisibility. Ethereum should aspire to this state: a protocol so stable and robust that its functionality is no longer debated, no longer tinkered with, and no longer the subject of headlines. The innovation and experimentation we celebrate today belong elsewhere—to layer 2s, to applications, to higher abstractions that build upon the rock-solid foundation of Ethereum’s base layer.

Ossification isn’t just a technical necessity; it’s a moral imperative. Blockchain technology was born in hostile environments, designed to resist attack and inspire trust. Every change, every EIP, every tweak to the core protocol introduces risk—new surfaces for attack, new opportunities for exploitation. Trust isn’t built on agility. It’s built on stability. Ethereum’s long-term viability depends on its ability to stop changing.

And yet, the community seems hesitant. We cling to our roles as developers, researchers, and moderators. We celebrate the vibrant discourse and constant evolution of the protocol. But this beautiful collaboration, as precious as it is, must eventually end. Not in failure, but in transformation. The Ethereum of the future will thrive not because we’re actively improving it, but because it no longer needs improvement.

**Community and the Fear of Irrelevance**

This transformation requires an existential reckoning for the community. The moderators, developers, and active participants who shape Ethereum today must confront an uncomfortable truth: their work is temporary. Ossification means fewer EIPs, less debate, and, ultimately, a shrinking community. But this isn’t a cause for alarm—it’s a sign of success.

When activity on forums decline, when user engagement wanes, when the vibrant culture around Ethereum fades into the background, we shouldn’t mourn. We should celebrate. These are the growing pains of maturity, the inevitable consequence of becoming “good enough.”

But the current culture resists this idea. Moderators worry about declining engagement. Developers push for agility over stability. The community as a whole clings to its relevance. This resistance isn’t just a barrier to ossification—it’s a denial of Ethereum’s destiny.

**Automating Governance: A Path Forward**

One way to confront this resistance is by leading through example. The Ethereum community, with its emphasis on decentralization and trustless systems, is uniquely positioned to pioneer a new approach to governance—one that relies not on human discretion, but on automation.

Imagine a world where moderation on platforms like Reddit is handled not by humans but by large language models (LLMs). These models, trained on transparent and community-approved guidelines, could analyze every post and comment, assign confidence scores, and act based on predefined thresholds. This system wouldn’t ban users out of emotion or bias but based on clear, consistent criteria. Every action would be explained, every decision traceable. Moderators would shift from enforcers to observers, fine-tuning the system rather than wielding power.

This isn’t just a pipe dream—it’s achievable with today’s technology. Implementing such systems would set a powerful precedent, demonstrating how decentralized, automated governance can outperform traditional, centralized methods. It could serve as a model not just for Ethereum, but for political and social systems worldwide.

**The Death of Agility, the Birth of Trust**

Ossification isn’t the end of Ethereum—it’s the beginning of its true potential. By becoming boring, Ethereum becomes reliable. By fading into the background, it becomes indispensable. And by embracing its own irrelevance, the community ensures that Ethereum’s impact will endure long after the debates have ended and the developers have moved on.

The question isn’t whether Ethereum can remain agile—it’s whether it has the courage to stop. To become boring. To die beautifully, so that the world it supports can thrive.

This isn’t just a technical argument. It’s a call to the soul of the community. Can we let go of what we’ve built so that it can live beyond us? Can we embrace the death of the Ethereum we know, to give birth to the Ethereum the world needs?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,ethereum,"Controlling the fee on Ethereum (Metamask, nodes and Etherscan) is just a nightmare - Is this a bug?",2024-11-22 08:39:51,"I'm not happy with how this went, but I wouldn't call this a rant. Let's call it a description of the nightmare that even someone as techy as a blockchain engineer had to go through to control the fee of their transaction. I see all these posts on Twitter about ""improving the user experience""... and Ethereum ecosystem can't get submitting transactions right... are you kidding me?

**It feels like in Metamask, it's made to be difficult so that people get frustrated and use the highest fee possible.** Tell me I'm crazy and this isn't your experience. Tell me I'm wrong. I'm all for learning how to do everything right.

What happened?

I wanted to sign (and submit) a transaction on metamask with a hardware wallet (HW). It's a smart contract transaction (and a big one, so the execution fee is unusually high), so I wanted to minimize the fee. Metamask was suggesting something like 45 gwei, which is very expensive and I'm not in a hurry. In blockchain (whether it's bitcoin, monero or otherwise), we're supposed to have the freedom to submit our transactions with low fees, and when the network is less congested it will go through. Right... RIGHT?

So, I whip out my HW  (which is a hassle, and I don't want to do it many times), I sign the transaction with 8 gwei, and submit it. 

To my surprise, not only the transaction failed, but the nonce is not incrememnted (not a smart contract transaction failure, as I see on the block explorer), AND METAMASK HAS NO OPTION TO REBROADCAST THE TRANSACTION, even though it's NOT invalid!!!!

I thought, OK, maybe this is a glitch. I'll do it again. I redo the signing with my HW. And it failed again, and again, and again. At that point, I realized that this is just Metamask trying to make my life hell. There's no option to rebroadcast, and it WANTS TO FORCE ME TO USE A HIGH FEE, so EVERY TIME I WANT TO SUBMIT THE SAME FREAKING TRANSACTION, I HAVE TO SIGN IT AGAIN????? Wtf is that supposed to be?

And here's what's even worse: There's no way to extract the signed transaction as a hex string, so that I can submit it later elsewhere... how dare I want to pay less fees? I must be crazy!

So, I was done with this shit and now I'm just stubborn. I opened the developer tools in the browser, tracked the function that submits transactions in Metamask, and pulled the transaction hex from the belly of that fox. Done. Now I have the signed transaction hex. 

Here's where Metamask problems end, and Etherscan problems begin.

I go to pushTx on Etherscan to submit the transaction, submit it, track it on Etherscan, and sleep on it.

Today in the morning, I wake up, I try to check the transaction, it hasn't gone through (it's not in a block yet), EVEN THOUGH THE SUGGESTED FEE NOW IS LOWER THAN THE FEE I USED FOR THE TRANSACTION. Etherscan still says that my transaction didn't go through. So what's wrong? 

If I have to guess what happened, I think all stakers/miners dropped my transaction from their mempools. Fine, I understand (even though this is hostile to user experience since all this is within 12 hours). So, I try to submit my transaction again using the hex I collected yesterday, but Etherscan complains that the transaction is ""already known""... wtf is that???? I immediately recognize that this is ANOTHER BUG... Etherscan has the transaction in its cache, but it's not in the mempool!

I go to another website that offers transaction hex submission, I submitted, and my transaction went through in 1 minute. NIGHTMARE IS F**KING OVER!

Conclusion: WTF was that? Am I the only one in the world who controls their fees?

**Edit:** Serious conclusion: If you're not a tech nerd like me, there's no way to defer submitting a transaction with low fee to a later time. You can only just keep signing the same transaction again and again when the fee you want is viable, or increase the fee. Horrible for usability.

**Edit 2:** Imagine being so tribal that you downvote such a detailed post from a blockchain expert explaining a real problem in Ethereum ecosystem.

Reddit,ethereum,Why nearly everyone misunderstands rollups. How it's possible to have both an optimistic bridge and zk bridge on a single rollup.,2024-11-21 23:40:26,"One of the most interesting panels at Devcon this month was **""[This is how rollups really work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k)"" by Kelvin Fichter** from Optimism, who says that most people in the crypto community have an incorrect understanding for what is a rollup.

This is actually a fairly deep concept, and there are even parts I still don't fully understand.

####**Most of us have an incorrect concept of what a rollup is**

Fichter brings up the idea that the concept of an ""optimistic rollup"" or ""zk rollup"" doesn't actually exist because ""classical rollups"" (i.e. smart contract rollups) are not purely defined by their smart contract bridges. Classical rollups can actually have multiple bridges, and they aren't necessarily fixed to one L1<>L2 bridge.

**The precise definition of a rollup he prefers is**:

> A blockchain that uses another blockchain for ordering and data availability.

In other words:

* Compressed data is completely stored on L1 (or in blobs)
* L1 ultimately provides ordering for the transactions in the rollup data
* For classical rollups, L1 also provides consensus for rollups through a trust-minimized bridge. For sovereign rollups, L2 nodes provide consensus.

And that's it. It does not necessarily need to have a bridge with optimistic proofs or zk proofs. And sovereign rollups do not even use the base layer for consensus.

This isn't the first time this idea has been brought up. Several other notable discussions:

* Jon Charbonneau - https://dba.mirror.xyz/LYUb_Y2huJhNUw_z8ltqui2d6KY8Fc3t_cnSE9rDL_o (an excellent summary)
* Kelvin Fichter - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlxSP_ABE4Y
* Toghrul Maharramov - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k

####**What would happen if a rollup had more than 1 bridge (optimistic + zk)?**

The vast majority of rollups we're familiar with (e.g. Optimism, Arbitrum One, Base, Linea) have exactly 1 enshrined bridge. We typically call them ""optimistic rollups"" or ""zk rollups"" as **a simplification of the definitions** because their main smart contract bridge back to L1 with the vast majority of TVL uses either optimistic proofs or zk proofs. If that single L1<>L2 bridge were compromised, the whole network would practically be compromised. So for simplicity, we assign the value of the rollup to that single bridge.

But technically, someone else could build a zk bridge on an ""optimistic rollup"" to store sequenced transaction data on L1. And if over time, 99% of the TVL transfers from the optimistic bridge over to the zk bridge, it would shift from being an optimistic rollup to a hybrid rollup and then to a zk rollup.

While I can't think of any rollup that currently has multiple types of bridges, the concept isn't new.

For example, the **Polygon PoS network** was originally a Plasma chain because it had a [Plasma bridge] (https://polygonscan.com/txnbridge) (that's still active). Later on, it shifted to a smart contract bridge, which ended up with nearly all the TVL activity. There are 2 main bridges on the same network, so Polygon PoS is more than just a Plasma chain or a Side chain. It's a network with 2 bridges of different types.

Overall, I think it's still fine to refer rollups as an ""optimistic rollup"" or a ""zk rollup"" as a simplification, but it's important to understand how rollups really works and why those terms are technically misleading.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

All I said was that ETH has more utility than BTC which is undeniably true.

I support both BTC and ETH but this toxicity between both “sides” is what is preventing new investors from pouring in. 

When half of what they hear is that BTC is a scam and it has no utility, and the other half is that ETH is a scam with pre-mined coins and unlimited inflation, I can see why potential “outsiders” are skeptical with the entire industry. 

This bickering needs to stop between BTC and ETH communities. Lots of legit scams out there in the crypto industry, but using “scam” to describe the two most legit cryptos in the industry is pulling us back from true mass adoption. 

I think BTC is the superior store of value. That doesn’t mean ETH doesn’t have potential to be the future of DeFi.

Reddit,ethereum,How to get Ethereum from my early 2016 Ethereum Wallet,2024-11-21 16:42:23,"In Feb 2016 I mined less than 1 Ethereum (says 0.70 probably closer to 0.69).  I can see the funds on Ethereum-Wallet-win64-0-3-9, which is also from Feb 2016.  I just ignored this for years as I didn't need the money but I do now.

I tried to send a very small amount to a Coinbase account I made.  Coinbase gives me the same address for receiving ETH from either ""Ethereum"" or ""Base"" Networks, so that's the address I used.  I tried a small amount to test (0.001) and it's at 0 of 12 confirmations for several hours now - so it did not work.  The first gas fees I tried were too low, but it did accept a higher gas fee and I had to input my password so means it's talking to the network to some extent right?

Under my 2016 Ethereum Wallet application, there is a ""Wallet Contracts"" section and an option to ""Add Wallet Contract"" and I don't have anything there.  But I'm wary to try to do much more with this nearly 9 years old Application.  When I click ""Etherbase"" with the key symbol it says ""Accounts can't display incoming transactions, but hold and send ether."" So I should be able to send from here, right?

I downloaded Ethereum Wallet and Mist Beta 0.11.1 - windows hotfix from Github today.  But it doesn't work on my PC.  ""Checksum mismatch in downloaded node!"" with an MD5 listed and then ""Please install the Geth node version 1.8.23 manually"".  Maybe because I have an older version?

How can I get this Ethereum to my Coinbase account?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

There are millions of ~~bots~~ people whose whole crypto experience is limited to Solana. I can easily imagine that many people's crypto experience could be limited to Base, especially since many successful L2 projects are copied on Base. So, from the user's POV, they have access to +/- the same dapps.

Of course, it's something that we don't want in the long run, as we want L2 diversity for security and innovation reasons. But I don't think that lack of interop is such a big barrier to growth as of November 2024.

Reddit,ethereum,Next Devcon location?,2024-11-20 13:10:17,"**Devcon 2024 was an absolute blast!**

Over 12K dedicated to Ethereum enthusiasts came together, creating an unforgettable atmosphere.

Incredible to see how Devcon continues to grow and evolve into a larger-scale event each year.

Over the years, Devcon has been hosted in incredible locations across the globe, including Germany, the UK, China, Mexico, the Czech Republic, Japan, Colombia, and Thailand.

https://preview.redd.it/07756dii122e1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef2a7ee05979513c51729541940a9b21b8dcc90a

So, the big question is: **Where will the next Devcon be held?** 👇

**My bet is Africa!**

* Devcon has touched almost every continent, and Africa feels like the natural next step to expand Ethereum’s reach.
* Africa has hosted countless blockchain courses, hackathons, and conferences in recent years, demonstrating a deep and growing interest in blockchain technologies. 
* Vitalik Buterin has visited Africa multiple times, championing blockchain innovation across the continent. In Zambia, a dynamic group of young entrepreneurs is working diligently with Vitalik’s support to position the country as a burgeoning technology hub in Africa. Furthermore, Ethereum developers are actively engaged in raising awareness and fostering growth within the African blockchain community.

The most compelling reason for my prediction lies in the burgeoning interest in Ethereum and blockchain technology among the African community. The enthusiasm for Ethereum and blockchain tech in Africa is unmatched.

At Devcon, there was an interesting talk by David Uzochukwu from Node Bridge Africa, who discussed the challenges and opportunities of running Ethereum nodes in Africa. He shared about overcoming infrastructure limitations, leveraging community support, the potential economic empowerment through staking, and fostering local adoption and innovation.

🔗 [youtube.com/watch?v=\_AywwOgu2zY](http://youtube.com/watch?v=_AywwOgu2zY)

With this growing interest and activity, I believe we’ll see a significant shift in ETH’s global node distribution, and Africa will soon have a notable presence.

So, that's my guess!

**Cape Town, Zambia, Zanzibar, or any other African city may be our next Devcon destination.**

Reddit,ethereum,How To Open Encrypted JSON Key Files,2024-11-19 15:11:44,"I see a ton of questions about how to open encrypted json keyfiles, so I thought I would just put this here. I am going to do this the ""old school"" way and show you how to open these files using tools built by Ethereum foundation themselves. This means you do not have to trust me or anyone in any way other than the people who actually built Ethereum. This is the safest way to open these files. Once you do this set of operations, you will get the private key itself that you can drop into whatever wallet you want.

First, you need to have GoLang ( a programming language ) installed. In order to install GoLang go to this website:  
[https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Follow the directions there and you will now have GoLang working on your machine. This is the programming language the Geth Ethereum node software is written in.

Next you need to download the Geth github repo. This is the actual Go-Ethereum node software that lets you run an Ethereum node, but we are not going to run the node itself. Instead we are going to run a tool that is part of the git repo, so you need to download the whole repo. You can do this by going here:  
[https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

https://preview.redd.it/ny1h8s41fv1e1.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f96c788e3e24a3f2c54af4324ae4f52938addb

Once you go there click on the Green Button that says ""Code"", then click on ""HTTPS"" and then click download zip.

Once you have downloaded the zip file, you can unzip it.

Now open a terminal and navigate to the \`/cmd\` directory from the unzipped source code. The sub directories should look something like this:  


https://preview.redd.it/qcgterzhfv1e1.png?width=1339&format=png&auto=webp&s=779e7404920c6caf8bba03db0174fb30f08a2733

What we want it the \`ethkey\` sub directory. So navigate there in your terminal.

Once there you can type the following to build the program and run it in the local directory:  
\`go run .\`

You should now see the help page for the utility and it should look something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/u5dun6h5iv1e1.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c2fc97bd96dc948aeb06213ebed6b065b66312f

Now copy your keyfile into the same directory as \`/cmd/ethkey\` and type in the following:

\`go run . inspect --private keyfile.json\`

Make sure you make the \`keyfile.json\` part of the command is the name of your keyfile. This will generate an output like this ( this is a burner account so don't bother trying to go dump it ):

The line that says \`Private key:\` is your private key. You can copy and paste this into Metamask or whatever.

If 336,384,000 blobs are created each year, and if the price of 1 blob is $10, does that mean that $3,363,840,000 is burned? Can we assume that about 1,121,280 Ether is burned each year?

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,Missed Opportunity,2024-11-26 18:46:20,"In 2015 I was a police officer. A kid (18-19 or so) stabbed another kid over a girl during a fight and the victim didn’t survive. They were all on heroin and obviously not making good decisions. I interviewed the kid and was tasked with the case. 

Part of that case was listening to his jail phone calls to see if he’d reveal any more info. He called several people a day and I had to sift through all of them. Most of the time I would listen to them in the car while on patrol. 

He was OBSESSED with bitcoin. So much so he had a bitcoin tattoo. He would try to convince everyone he spoke with to buy bitcoin. This went on for weeks. It was brought up in every single conversation. So much so that I started to believe it. I looked it up and they were under $500 a piece I believe. I thought what the hell maybe he’s right? I was going to spend $1,000 on it and just see what happens.

I got half of my credit card entered, stopped and thought, what the hell am I doing? I’m taking advice from a teenage heroin user that just unalived another person. Closed out and never tried again. 

I should have took that little shits advice and I think about this at least monthly. He talked about having a couple hundred bitcoin and he’d never go under 100 if he sells off. He got 10 years in prison so if he’s not out now, he will be next year. I’ve always been curious as to how much he has and what he’s going to do with it when he gets out. ",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,bitcoin,"It’s Going Down, I’m Selling Everything!",2024-11-26 08:21:32,"Before you hit the sell button, take a deep breath. Market volatility can be overwhelming, but it’s important to zoom out and focus on the bigger picture. Here are some key reasons why holding Bitcoin for the long term might be a better strategy than panic-selling during dips:

1. Volatility Is Normal

Bitcoin has always been volatile. There have been multiple corrections of 50% or more in its history, yet it has managed to recover and reach new all-time highs. Dips are part of the game; they don’t define the long-term trajectory.

2. Time in the Market Beats Timing the Market

Trying to perfectly time the market is nearly impossible. Historically, those who simply held onto their Bitcoin through the ups and downs have outperformed traders who panic-sell or try to time their re-entries.

3. Adoption Is Growing

Every year, Bitcoin gains more adoption from institutions, governments, and individuals. This trend suggests a bright future, even if the current price action looks grim.

4. Bitcoin Is Scarce

With a fixed supply of 21 million, Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary. As demand grows, the limited supply could make Bitcoin more valuable over time.

5. Zoom Out

Look at Bitcoin’s performance over the last decade. Despite crashes, bear markets, and fear, Bitcoin has consistently grown in value for those who held long-term. Short-term movements are just noise.

6. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

If you’re nervous about buying during volatile times, DCA is a great strategy. It lets you buy small amounts over time, reducing the impact of market swings and emotional decisions.

7. Avoid Emotional Decisions

Markets thrive on fear and greed. Selling in panic locks in losses, while holding or accumulating during tough times allows you to benefit when the market rebounds.

Final Thought:
Bitcoin isn’t just an investment—it’s a revolution in financial systems. Selling during a dip means you’re letting fear dictate your decisions. Instead, focus on the fundamentals, keep a long-term perspective, and remember why you got into Bitcoin in the first place.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin paid for my masters degree,2024-11-26 15:26:32,"It's not a down payment on a house but I wanted to share my little success story.

For context, I was a college dropout and ended up living out of my car and remember only having $5 in my wallet and in debt. Ever since then I have always felt financial anxiety and insecure due to trauma. It takes a whole lot to buy or purchase things I don't need and I am very frugal in my spending on anything considered non-essential. Long story short, turned my life around, finished my bachelors, and thought about getting my masters. Around that time I found out about bitcoin and essentially did the research and bought whatever amount I could afford and have been continually buying more when I could afford it. Since then, I have been taking out of my holdings each semester to pay for my courses and also towards my rent while I'm practically studying full-time while doing a full-time internship that pays nothing, but that I have to do in order to get my hours/experience. Thankfully, the cost of my school is extremely low and I already live so frugally that during this entire process, the price of bitcoin has risen and even though I have been taking money little by little each semester out of my holdings, the ""number still go up"". I pretty much have made it all back at the same time.

Michael Saylor's quote ""Bitcoin is freedom."" rings very true for me. Not only financially and from a broken system, but freedom in my mind to overcome the financial anxiety that plagued me due to my past experiences. On top of that, I love my profession that bitcoin has paid for. I will continue to stack sats, be a good human being, and begin to start actually enjoying living life. Cheers

TLDR, bitcoin has not only paid for my living expenses, but also my college courses, and I am graduating basically with no debt.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Sending bitcoin was impossible as received ERROR 500.  Apparently due to regulations in the UK, this wallet function has been stopped. I could see the bitcoin, it was in ACCOUNT 2 on WALLET 2, and I had the seed phrase.

A restore to ELECTRUM wallet using the seed phrase showed zero bitcoin. I am no expert, so it took me some time before I checked the receive addresses on the ELECTRUM and ARCBIT wallets, and as they were the same this confirmed the restore phrase was working. After more time I found that ACCOUNT 1 was the default main account and this contained no bitcoin.

The next thing I found out about was derivation paths, a big thank you to  [https://learnmeabitcoin.com](https://learnmeabitcoin.com)

so, to restore the wallet I downloaded the ELECTRUM wallet to my PC.

I double clicked the ELECTRUM icon to start the software

On the first line which says 'Wallet' I typed the name I chose to call the wallet

On the next screen I chose 'Standard Wallet'

On the next screen I chose 'I already have a seed'

On the next screen I entered my 12 word seed phrase.

I clicked on 'options' and selected BIP39 seed, and clicked on 'Next'

I selected 'legacy (p2pkh)' NOTE(This means the receive addresses in the wallet start with a 1)

I changed the derivation path from 'm/44h/0h/0h' to 'm/44h/0h/1h' and clicked on 'Next'. NOTE(the first zero indicates the crypto type. The second zero points to the default account (ACCOUNT 1), changing this to 1 points to ACCOUNT 2)

On the next screen I chose a password. NOTE - write this down in a safe place.

20. 2024: UK Pension Fund allocates 3% to Bitcoin. (Bitcoin: ~$95,000)

This chart maps 20 key moments in Bitcoin’s adoption, from early experiments like Cyprus in 2013 to corporate treasury moves by MicroStrategy and Tesla, and now the involvement of pension funds and governments. Each milestone has pushed Bitcoin further into the global financial system and driven its price higher.

But what comes next? Could we see sovereign wealth funds making allocations? Another nation adopting Bitcoin as legal tender? Central banks adding it to their reserves? Or perhaps Bitcoin becoming part of global trade settlements?

What do you think the next major milestone will be that moves the needle for Bitcoin adoption and price? ",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

By the 2020 cycle, as Bitcoin gained institutional adoption and deeper liquidity, corrections averaged 20-30%, signaling diminishing volatility with scale. 

In 2024, Bitcoin is even more mature, with trillions in market cap and strategic buyers like Michael Saylor executing $5.3 billion in purchases, creating a powerful price floor. 

With reduced sell-side liquidity and increased demand, this cycle’s corrections could shrink further to 5-10%, that's why I am putting my money where my mouth is.

Reddit,bitcoin,Finally flipped on bitcoin,2024-11-26 09:33:56,"After digging through some painfully old resources on bitcoins power law, metcalfes law, the robustness of dense networks to shocks etc. I've finally gone from having no money in bitcoin and seeing it as the modern south seas bubble to 20% of my net worth going in, and then 20% of my income.

Either the power law continues to hold until some plateua where the technology has maximally matured and the coins I've bought take on a relatively stable buying power, and there is monetary expansion where the final value of the tokens is absorbed as inflation on fiat, or there is some event where it starts spiralling to zero, which is something I can tolerate since I've got decades of career ahead of me.

Either it 10x's one last time and dethrones gold, and stops being a risk asset, or I lose it all, and I've emotionally accepted both potential outcomes and will stop looking at the price.

The painful thing is that my decision has nothing to do with the price going up and instead, entirely reading posts on fundamentals from pre 2015 from people who are now, very, very wealthy and I'm fairly confident I'd have made the same decision I'm making right now if I'd bothered to read any of it at the time.

The one consolation is that I am not excluded from the network effect and as much as it seems like I could have invested back then and profited immensely everytime deviation from the power law fit got too much, probability says that I didn't, because almost nobody else did.

The main thing that kept me out of the market for so many years has been the sheer ammount of rot coming from the NFT and alt coin space, but I've since realised that there is no law saying that an investment oppurtunity has to primarily benefit smart or intelligent people. Only the most risk on people went all in on crypto in the early days, and for every investor making a long term bet on a power law holding there was a loud idiot with a gambling problem who stumbled into something sustainable by chance alone.

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 34th monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 NOVEMBER Pre Melt-Up Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for nearly 7 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **OCTOBER Highlights:** \- Mostly red month. Only **BTC** and **BNB** in positive overall territory. **SOL** getting close to break even. 2022 Top Ten is the worst performing portfolio, by far.
* DCA'ing just once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period **198% vs. 66%** (see below for details)

# Month Thirty-Four – Down -44%

https://preview.redd.it/yc0hgdv3593e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0a03fe66252477a65f770d15cd05a40ca444f93

The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC/UST, XRP, LUNA/LUNC, DOT, AVAX.**  

October highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Mostly red month, with the exceptions of **BTC** and **SOL**
* **BTC** solidly in first place with **BNB** in second
* Nearly three years into the Experiment, most coins haven’t reached their break even point yet
* The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -44% as a whole.

# October Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranking thirty-four months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/4lxs11eb593e1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=3717d5b8e4e40ca30a6c360091e89916e3523401

With a few notable exceptions, there has been remarkably little movement in rank after nearly three years. 

# October Winners and Losers

***October Winners*** – **BTC** (+10%) and **SOL** (+8%) easily outperformed the field in October.

***October Losers*** – **XRP** (-18%) fell the most this month.

# Overall Update: BTC maintains lead over BNB.  Only BTC and BNB are in positive territory. LUNC worst performing in the 2022 Portfolio and worst performing crypto of all the Top Ten Experiments.

**BTC** (49%) maintained its lead over second place **BNB** (+12%).  **SOL** is in third place at -2% since January 2022, nearing break even point.

Ever since **LUNC’s** (then known as **LUNA**) [crash in May of 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/), it has remained hopelessly at the bottom, worth a fraction of a cent.  The initial $100 invested in **Luna** thirty-four months ago is worth $0.0001 today – the worst performance of any coin in any of the seven Top Ten Experiments, by far.  It’s hard to remember/believe that **LUNA** was the highest performing Top Ten Crypto of the first quarter of 2022, before the crash.

Additionally, at -44%, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/0dqn9l6g593e1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=c425ed5afdc5ac49496a6f63847691f04f59fdd9

Overall, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is down -44%.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth **$555.** 

There hasn’t been a positive overall ROI month yet, although the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio flirted with the break even point in [March 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/).  

# A note on USDC/UST

In retrospect this was not my best idea: I was a bit bored of simply holding a stablecoin in the Top Ten as I’ve been doing since 2019 and thought I’d showcase some of the possibilities available in crypto to build on stablecoin holdings.  My plan was to start nice and easy with trusted CeFi platforms, taking advantage of sign up bonuses, then move to more advanced DeFi strategies.  As fate would have it, I decided to showcase the TerraLuna chain converting my USDC to UST and then staking with Anchor.

It was all going pretty well until May 2022. Then the LUNA implosion happened. My **UST** is now worth $2.24, down -98%.

It’s a good reminder that anything can and does happen in crypto and we should all continue to be careful. I’m thankful that the lesson only cost me $100:  I know a lot of other people got hit much, much harder.

# Total Crypto Market:

The entire market has done much better than my Top Ten portfolio, +6% since January 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/r6pvnv9t593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a31e6afe5d7ca542ec4f01de4065e44815db44

# Bitcoin Dominance:

BitDom ended October at 59% and has slowly but steadily been rising since late 2022. Chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/h96cia8v593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ad10273aab33d7ccd4b3adb3ed75efd0c4cb91f

For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the **Bitcoin** dominance figure, as it can signal appetite for altcoins vs. **BTC.**

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,829**

**That’s up +198%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

In summary: ***That’s a +198% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/qc88z4b0693e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1780e68ac96fd418f34e41d7e5b3d353b3e684

The S&P 500 is up +20% since January 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,200 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+198%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

As the last section demonstrates, if you can stomach crypto’s volatility (a big if) over the past few years, you’ll find better overall returns in crypto vs. traditional markets – at least at this point in the Experiments.

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  October’s extended report covers the [2022 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), which you are reading now.  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), and  [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) Portfolio reports as well.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,You're about to be scammed. A lot. ,2024-11-25 22:51:53,"You're new to the crypto game...regret not getting in earlier because blah blah blah.

Listen...you're going to see a lot of things that promise you lots of money. But trust me when I say this..you won't make a lot unless you get lucky. You won't make millions or tens of thousands. Most of us have been slowly buying over the last 4+ years. We've seen bad days and we've seen worse days...

Set your expectations to smaller gains, especially if you've jumped on this in the past month or 2.

DO NOT connect your wallet to anything. If you do, make sure your wallet is empty. Never ever ever connect your main wallet to anything. Most of us have multiple wallets for the same coin for this reason (that and a bit more privacy). 

There are a lot of rug pull coins, we're seeing it happen...this has happened before, just Google squid game coin (which for some dumb fucking reason, people are rebuying into FFS).

Please please please be careful. If you do get scammed or rug pulled people may say you deserve it, but that's a shitty thing to say especially as a lot of us want crypto to have massive adoption. This just puts more people off and sets a really negative stigma on what crypto is and can be. 

Do your research, don't just follow some YouTube cunt who wants to make gains off of your investments. Their only interests are their pockets (the more people buy and invest the more the coin they're shilling goes up), they don't care about you. 

Also, invest in what you're comfortable with losing. 
And remember, what goes up...must come down (if you're down 10%...gaining 10% wont get you back to where you were...) 

If you have other advice to give or ranting posts on what to watch out for, please do. I joined this subreddit to learn more about crypto and not just shill a coin...

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why would MicroStrategy purchase additional 50% of their BTC holding at the peak?

Until now, this seemed like very smart and wise DCA however what they have done this month is questionable.

In this month, November 2024 they have purchased 134,480 BTC which was over 50% of their entire holding of BTC as of the end of October 2024. Further they have paid for it over 10B which is more than they have paid for the 252,220 BTC that they have been acquiring over last 4 years or so.

Unless they are leveraging the gains of previously acquired BTC to get more BTC, their purchases from November 2024 or doing this to get publicity - this does not make sense to me. Why would they spend 100% of what they have been spending at ATH of BTC to get roughly 50% BTC when they believed in BTC all this time.

I've just read a reddit post about someone sending LiteCoin to a Bitcoin address by mistake, and all the comments were along the lines of ""it's gone forever"". 

How is it possible that a Bitcoin address passes the validation when sending LiteCoin and this transaction was accepted by the network? Given that a typo would most likely result in a rejection since some sort of checksum would fail, how is it even possible for a whole other cryptocurrency address to pass? 

Surely this is a known weakness and when new currencies are created their protocol for addresses is designed not to clash with other currencies?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why I feel good about holding ,2024-11-25 20:18:24,"The trend of bull runs is that we reach an aggressive growth spurt and either we see a mild dip or a substantial dip. Historically, mills dips are followed by a larger peak and then a big correction where things get stagnant. It seems to me we are currently in a mild correction as many sell and re-purchase. Based on past trends it's highly likely we will see a larger peak in the coming weeks. At that point we will likely see a big correction and stagnation. 

So I'm holding out for one more peak and hope to take some profits. ",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"The contradictory anti-crypto argument: ""Nobody is gonna use crypto because it's useless and doesn't work....but at the same time it's great for criminals because it's cheap and easy for them to transfer money around the world without a bank or anything blocking their transactions"". ",2024-11-25 17:06:54,"I never understood these anti-crypto narratives, and they seem just as contradictory, as they seem a little out of touch.

They say it's too expensive, too hard, and to slow to use for transactions.

Yet, here I was last week ordering another batch of porn online, and in just 4 clicks using my XLM that went through in about a second, with a $0.00005 fee. And they gave me a little discount for not using a credit card, which was more money back than a credit card's cashback.

There's many cryptos that do cheap and fast transactions now. I think SOL still being the fastest, and NANO being completely free.

And then, in the next sentence they'll tell you it's a currency that criminals love to use.

They'll say it's too easy for criminals to use crypto now, it doesn't cost them much, and they can quickly get a drug deal executed, or transfer money around the world without having any bank or government in between that can stop the transaction.

And the person on the other side can be sure they got paid with the money in their hands, because it's a direct P2P payment, without any switcheroo, block, or reversed transaction.

And they would be right about that.

But while criminals can easily move money without that money being stopped, if they use a chain like Bitcoin, it can still somewhat be tracked. Especially if they're not smart about it.

It's still a transparent ledger, so while they can't stop the transaction, and the person on the other side will definitely get their money, the government can see it (if they know what to look for in the first place), and potentially track it if there is some sort of known in the equation.

**Conclusion:**

Yes, crypto has become increasingly easier to use, has been getting cheaper and faster, that it's become a nice tool for everyone, including criminals, to transfer money around the world in a more direct and more pseudo-anonymous way, without any bank or institution in between.

But many of these chains are still transparent, so criminals aren't gonna be immune from being tracked by governments that have enough advanced tools and can subpoena exchanges and businesses to divulge the key information to figure out what transaction might belong to them.

It can still be somewhat useful to criminals in some cases, and makes their transaction direct and untouchable, but doesn't always make the criminals themselves untouchable or untraceable.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Coinbase forum. I love it,2024-11-26 18:56:08,"I mean, why would Coinbase open a forum to solve customers problems? Everyone can see it. What a way to promote their business! Because there is nothing like a successful customer acquisition strategy than to showcase a forum filled with the dumbest customers ever, bitching about Coinbase being a thief (which they are but not for the reasons given by the geniuses investing.)

Though I gotta love the posts. Laugh sooo hard at the stupidity,  of people, FOMO'ing from the mouth and coming out of the woods who have never gotten into trading except through their broker managed 403k accounts, which a lot of people dont even know whatt their 403k is invested in. Same people now want to  who have no clue what investing entailes want to invest in crypto assets that are not user friendly at all and are volatile.

its like reading and i just visualize a chimp trying to shove the block into the circle slot, getting enraged as to why it doesnt fit. I TRANSFERRED $50 OF BTC TO THIS ETH WALLET AND COINBASE STOLE MY FUNDS!!!! Lmaoooooo. Ohhhh. Im collecting these posts and am going to show case in forum called Even Micheal Saylor couldnt stop these geniuses from loosing their life savings.

Anyways, crooked coinbase deserves chimps throwing shit at their reputation. Crooked because check out SEC's investigation into coinbases morally corrupt exploitation of their staking assets products. Holding onto customers crypto for months after initial unstake request. Investigation finds they are using money generated of interest earned to fund their pockets. Yes they take a percentage of the interest earned on staking rewards asset, which should all go to customer as coinbase makes their profit of market spreads and their transaction fees. Beware of staking. Atleast in my experience its not for generating more money as coinbase advertises. Staking was created to grow membership into a crypto currencys community.

I was hoping someone could guide me in the right direction.  I have my cold wallet setup and tested with a few bucks in there.  I have (to me) a decent amount in Robinhood and I’m looking to pull it all off.

My question though is if I pull it off and store it for a few years, when I’m ready to sell or exchange and put it back on Robinhood will they have all of the information I need in order to file taxes properly?  Or is this something I have to track myself?

Also, sending crypto to your wallet doesn’t trigger a tax event right?  Considering it’s property just being transferred until sold or exchanged?

Just trying to cover my basis because I’ve read about nightmares in crypto tax world.  How much does koinly cost?  Is that worth it as well?  Shouldn’t have to use it if everything is done on Robinhood right?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Creating a platform that utilizes crowdfunding & crypto to help startups raise funds,2024-11-26 14:51:34,"
Hello guys,  
I’m creating a startup platform with a unique twist blending traditional crowdfunding with cryptocurrency mechanics. Here’s how it works: users can purchase our platform's cryptocurrency, but startups won’t be funded directly with crypto. Instead, when someone contributes to a startup, a portion of the platform's cryptocurrency supply gets burned. This reduces the overall supply, potentially increasing its value while supporting startup growth.

Yes some traders may be lucky enough to buy an altcoin before a rally and if you are good for you, but TAKE PROFIT. Seriously. You bought Cardano at $.45 and it more than doubles - at a minimum get back your initial USD investment. Holding profitable alts long term is how this sub probably loses the most money. 

**If you make money on an alt** 

**Do:** 

* **get back your initial investment**

**Do not:** 

* **Hodl everything for even more future profits** 
* **Double Down and buy more** 

**Seriously if this post trends check the comments of this post and I guarantee people will tell you how they bought an alt in 2021 held for huge gains and then held back down for a significant loss.**  

\-----

If you are new here learn from the mistakes of those that were here for previous cycles, take profit on alts. Period.

I once bought a bitcoin for $300 and forgot about it for a year. When I remembered again, it was worth $600. Instead of saying ""Wow thats a good ROI"", I sold it and went on $600 party binge. All this to say, I need help understanding how crypto things work. Particularly related to WLFI. 

Ive read the ""Gold Paper"" (woof). Theres a lot of confusing things in there: 

1. I cant sell my WLFI? Im assuming one day Ill be able to sell it? Otherwise why would they make this currency?  Is this common for new coins?

2. The founders look like failed crypto business people. One is also pick up artist, presumably failed as well. Do we know what stake Trump has in this currency? Is anyone reliable involved? 

3. Is the technology sound? I believe it uses Ether's blockchain. Thats good right? Will this WLFI coin be unusually susceptible to theft? 

4. Right now they sell for $.015 per coin on the WLFI website. Do we have any idea of the current market value? Is there a secondary market anywhere? 

5. Could this one day be a real coin? Obviously Trump likes things with his name on them and will soon have lots of power. Might he eventually make this thing legit?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Best Exchanges List for Newbies,2024-11-26 18:23:03,"I'm starting to see so many new posts of new people coming into the market asking which exchange is the best. I am creating this post to reach out to those new people and people of the future who will come into this space as the bullrun progresses.

Best exchanges in US and Europe:

1. Coinbase
2. Gemini

Best exchanges outside US and Europe:

1. Coinbase
2. Gemini

As someone who has been in this space since 2017, I recommend staying away from all other exchanges.

Kraken - its fine, not the best. Kraken has history of doing shady things in the past, specifically during the 2020 bull run.

Binance - there's a reason why their CEO went to jail. Binance was found to be counter trading and manipulating the market to liquidate shorts and longs using your information of where you place your sell (shorts) and buy (long) orders to take people's money.

Robinhood - they froze Gamestop trading during 2021. I wouldn't trust them.

Kucoin - scam! run away

Bitfinex - low volume and liquidity (this makes selling and buying difficult as selling or buying decent amount of money worth of crypto moves the price alot. This means you will pay more to buy crypto and receive less money for selling crypto)

Bybit, Bitget, Htx, Mexc, OkX, bitthumb, etc etc. - I've seen so many new exchanges popping out of the woodworks in the last year. Worst part is, alot of them are paying big money to youtubers to shill their exchanges to get new people onto them. This is alarming. Dont listen to these youtubers telling you what to buy, where to buy etc. Do your own research and make your own bids. Any one of these new exchanges could be rugpulls/scams just like FTX and Mt Gox or do some shady stuff. Also stay away from p2p exchanges. These are just like selling or buying CSGO skins on shady websites. Lots of people got ripped off buying/selling cs go skins in 2010's until reputable websites popped up much later on.

If you want to get into crypto, get KYC'd, and go into reputable exchanges that are regulated. Yes, coinbase and gemini have high fees. But this is the price you pay to get into crypto without getting scammed, unless you want to put your hard earned money at risk. I hope this post helps all the new people and good luck to everyone this bull run!

P,S. regarding korean and japanese exchanges, i dont really know much about them. I would ask someone else in the comments who may be more familiar with the region's crypto lands.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"In case you missed it, a Warpcast user has created an AI agent that creates tokens with a single post/reply",2024-11-25 13:21:32,"So, about two weeks ago, two users created an AI agent (called Clanker) on warpcast. 

  
You call upon this AI agent by @ him, and ask him to create a token. You need to give the name, ticker, and optionally a picture to be used. That's LITERALLY all it takes. 



the bot then creates:

* token on the Base network,
* dexscreener page ,
* uniswap listing and LP (1% pair).



All of it from a single cast. 

Naturally, people went nuts over it. First one was Clanker token itself (ordered to be created by the dev team of the AI agent). One user instructed another AI agent to give the commend to this AI agent to create a token (LUM). It exploded to 45M mcap. Another account said to Clanker to create a token, and if you own a certain amount of this token, you can cast anonymously under the account Superanon. Thing snowballed pretty quickly. In two weeks, over 3k tokens have been created. Also, let's say you make a token with clanker. You as a requestor get a certain amount of fees the LP creates. 

No, it's not a scam. No, it's not a honey pot, the contract ensures anyone and everyone can sell. No, it's not a copy of pumpfun or wow, as the tokens are immediately listed on Uni with a V3 pair (there is no bonding, maturing or whatnot). No, you don't need to put any funds into it (creation of a token is absolutely free). Yes, there are sniper bots currently, buying seconds after the tokens are created (it is being solved, but be warned). 

So, want to try it? Get a wallet for ETH, transfer a small amount of ETH from a CeX to your decentralized wallet, bridge to Base ETH, install warpcast, and you're good to go.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

I'm still relatively new to crypto (I've been investing for about 3 months), and this bot could make college a lot easier, but only if it's real. Normally a bot advertising high profits and using pushy language (like ""don't message me if you're scared or if you're wasting time) would be suspicious, obviously, but again, if it is the real Satoshi, that's different.

What worries me most right now is Litecoin, as I didn't look into it much before buying (I did my research for solana & ethereum, and impulsively bought into Litecoin like a moron). 

Was Litecoin a wise choice?

Later I read good reviews for Exodus wallet though, but also read many people saying their fees are very high compared to other wallets. So which wallet should I use based on your knowledge that offers safety and low fees at the same time (if that’s a possibility)?
Is Coin98 (the one I installed) a good and safe enough wallet and which there’s not much to be worried about if I keep using it? Or should I choose another one instead?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

If you’re doing that, you’re LATE to the party. That’s a fact you should internalize, alright?

Now listen up… BTC is about to break $100k real soon, and when it does, the media machine is gonna crank up the hype for retail. When retail rolls in, they’ll see BTC as way too pricey and honestly, they’re not wrong.

So, what’s next? They scroll down the CMC list and start looking for tokens that “make sense.” These usually fall into three categories: AI (because of the hype), gaming, and memes. And let’s be real, gaming and memes are waaay easier for them to wrap their heads around.

Need proof? Look at the dino gaming coins like GALA and SAND. They’ve been popping off this past week. Nobody on CT is seriously bidding them outside of quick scalps. And what about DOGE and PEPE? They’ve run hard too.

Alright, so here’s the play: the biggest runners might come from gaming and meme sectors. And what meta hasn’t popped off yet? Gaming memecoins.

I’m just saying. This is your shot to actually beat the herd. Position yourself early in a fresh meta that hasn’t fully caught on yet. It means going against the n00bs who have ADHD and religiously follow every green candle out there.

Take what you’ve learned from Murad about strong communities, delusional valuation beliefs, and unique vibes. Calmly analyze the market. Find those gaming memecoin gems that are poised to run hard.

Congrats. You’re now two steps ahead of the herd.

BUY THE RED BUT STRONG CHARTS AND SELL THE FINAL META.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,We're still early. ,2024-11-24 21:21:59,"I like to use credit cards as a comparison. What would later become Visa was first launched in 1958 by Bank of America. It was initially known as the [BankAmericard credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.#:~:text=Visa%20was%20founded%20in%201958,other%20financial%20institutions%20in%201966) program. Fast forward a couple decades, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRwJw3Bdavs) to see how people reacted to Burger King's news that it would accept credit cards at all locations in 1993. The tenor? Skepticism. Adoption takes time. People adjusting to new systems, vocabulary, and behavior takes time. We're still early.

However, don't be stupid. Make a plan. Here's my plan: I'm selling a third of all my holdings once the total market cap of all coins hits 4 trillion dollars. I'll sell another third of all my holdings once the total market market cap hits 7 trillion dollars. Most of my portfolio is in BTC. The majority of my other holdings are the big L1 smart contract platforms that can handle volume. I don't know which will win so I own several of them. I figure that if 1 to 3 win in the bag, then it'll pay for the losses of the rest. If crypto falls below 2 trillion total market cap, then I'll resume DCA in my portfolio. At current prices I'm not buying anything.

That's my plan. I'm not saying that it's the best plan, but it's what I'm doing. Yes we're early. But make a plan so that you're not second guessing yourself everyday as prices shift around.",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,crypto,Going from KEM to Signatures,2024-10-13 12:46:29,"Is there a known efficient way to generically convert a secure KEM into a signature scheme? I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme.  
I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Reddit,crypto,Is there a risk of allowing degenerancy of bilinear pairings in the case of the Groth16 zk‑snark system ? (this can be done by allowing point at infinity) ,2024-09-16 23:03:20,"The non degeneracy criteria is there’s no billenear pairing resulting in the finite field element 1 equivalent.

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash makes this a requirement and provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

But what would happen if it would be the cases as it’s happening on some implementation using Ethereum’s ᴇɪᴘ‐197 precompile ? Are there security risk when public inputs are used and if yes how this can be done ?  
Or is it only a problem for other Zk‐Snark systems and not Groth16 with public inputs ?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

So in my app the user's password will be used for both account authentication and file encryption key. Below is the schematics of my process

user authentication:  
password + salt -> bcrypt -> stored password hash & salt value in db

when user login, will use bcrypt on the plaintext password and the stored salt value to make sure the hash match with the one in database.

file encryption:  
generate pbkdf2 derived password from main password + salt value (the same one in db) -> this derived key then be used for aes file encryption / decryption key

For the sake of simplicity, I am using the same salt value in the database for both authentication and pdkdf2 aes key generation, I think it's safe, just wanted a second opinion. Thanks",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357

Reddit,crypto,"Writing a college essay - need clarification on ""Post-Quantum"" encryption algorithms ",2024-09-09 01:30:43,"I'm writing a 250-word supplemental college essay, and I chose my topic to be cryptology/cyber-security and why it's important to me.  I've done two summer camps, both heavily focused on cryptology, and I learned about the basics like RSA and other encryption algorithms. I also learned about Shor's algorithm, and cryptology in the post-quantum world. I was under the impression that if an efficient, large-scale quantum computer was built tomorrow, we wouldn't have an algorithm that couldn't just be cracked by Shor's algorithm, but I did more research and I'm pretty sure that's not true anymore. I wanted to get your guys' opinions, on whether or not we have encryption techniques that could be implemented once a quantum computer is manufactured. 

And kinda related question, would me saying that ""in the race between encryptors and cryptanalysts/hackers, the cryptanalysts/hackers are winning"", be objectively false?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357
Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-11-27 00:55:57.565357
