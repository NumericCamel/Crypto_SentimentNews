After weeks of excitement and upward momentum, the market has cooled off, and BTC is currently consolidating below the critical $70,000 level. This consolidation phase is crucial as traders assess the next potential move for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High – Smart Money Accumulation? Analyst Ali Martinez has shared significant data from Binance, highlighting the high risk for short positions at the $68,500 mark. When such risk levels are present, the price often seeks liquidity, which suggests that it may gravitate toward supply zones. This behavior indicates that the market is potentially targeting areas where sellers may be positioned, which could lead to further fluctuations in price. The interplay between these resistance and support levels will determine Bitcoin’s trajectory. A decisive move above these levels could signal Bitcoin’s next phase, making it critical for investors to remain vigilant. Bitcoin Short Squeeze Looms Bitcoin is reaching a pivotal moment, with the market buzzing with expectations for a potential push toward all-time highs. Martinez recently shared crucial data on X, revealing that a significant number of short positions are at risk of liquidation, particularly around the $68,598 mark. The cumulative short liquidation leverage at this price level is approximately $452.36 million, indicating that a substantial amount of capital could be affected if the price continues to rise. This scenario sets the stage for a bullish outlook, as overleveraged short positions suggest that Bitcoin could find liquidity at supply levels. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure. When the price breaks above the key $69,000 mark, it could lead to a wave of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among traders and investors watching from the sidelines. The liquidation of these short positions could propel Bitcoin’s price higher, strengthening the bullish narrative. Market participants closely monitor this critical threshold, as a decisive break above $69,000 could ignite a surge toward previously untested highs. Related Reading: Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‘Send SOL To The Moon’ – Crypto Analyst Maintaining awareness of both market dynamics and key price levels is essential for traders looking to navigate the volatility. The next few days could prove crucial as Bitcoin approaches this significant moment, and how it reacts to these overleveraged positions may determine its trajectory in the coming weeks. BTC Liquidity Levels Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $67,100 after a week marked by volatility and uncertainty. The price has pushed above the $66,000 level, signaling strength and hinting at a potential rally in the coming weeks. This upward movement reflects renewed optimism in the market, as investors look for signs of sustained bullish momentum. However, it’s essential for BTC to maintain its position above the $65,000 mark. If the price fails to hold this level, a sideways consolidation may occur, allowing the market to gather liquidity before making its next move. This consolidation phase could set the stage for a surge in buying activity as traders look to capitalize on potential opportunities.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Toncoin Sharpe Ratio Is Falling: What It Means And — Is It Time To Buy?,2024-10-27 09:30:39+00:00,"Toncoin, which is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2024, has also been affected in recent months by the widespread bearish climate of the market. The price of the altcoin seems to be recovering nicely after suffering an abrupt decline on Friday, October 26.  As of this writing, the value of Toncoin stands around $4.92, reflecting an almost 3% upswing in the past day. However, this single-day action has had minimal impact on the token’s performance on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the TON price is down by nearly 7% in the past week. What Does The Declining Sharpe Ratio Mean? In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost explained the relevance of the “Sharpe Ratio” metric to cryptocurrency price. According to the crypto pundit, the Sharpe Ratio for Toncoin has been in decline in recent weeks, signaling a period of decreased risk. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means The relevant metric here is the Sharpe Ratio, which assesses the risk-adjusted returns of an investment. This indicator basically measures how much profit an investment offers per unit of risk (considering risk is quantified by volatility). Typically, a rising Sharpe Ratio signals a higher risk-adjusted performance. On the other hand, when this metric is in a downward trend, it implies that the coin is in a “lower-risk zone” and profits are becoming less significant.  According to Darkfost, it appears that both volatility and risk are decreasing for Toncoin, as its Sharpe Ratio continues to fall. With the altcoin showing reduced sensitivity to price fluctuations, it offers a more favorable risk-return balance and a less risky market for investors. A less volatile market condition may be ideal for Toncoin investors to accumulate tokens with less exposure to abrupt price movements. The Quicktake analyst, however, warned investors to approach the market with caution as the “lower-risk zone” may not be completely safe.  Darkfost specifically advised investors to still watch out for Bitcoin’s price movements, as the market tends to respond to swings from the premier cryptocurrency. Toncoin To Overtake Ethereum In This Metric Before 2025 In a separate Quicktake post, an analyst has projected Toncoin to overtake Ethereum in terms of adoption before the end of 2024. According to Maartunn, the number of TON holders, which currently stands at 112 million, is expected to surpass ETH holders by December 20, 2024. This projection is based on Toncoin’s recent growth spurt, which has seen the network gain an average of 500,000 new holders daily over the past month. According to the Quicktake analyst, the number of TON holders could exceed that of Ethereum (currently 137 million) if this trend continues. Related Reading: Would Bitcoin Reclaim $70,000 Soon? Key Data Suggests New Investors Hold the Key However, Maartunn noted that this prediction doesn’t account for the potential of a slowdown in TON’s growth rate and the continuous growth of ETH holders.

This level is relevant for bulls, as holding above could pave the way for a rally in the coming weeks. Crypto analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis indicating that Solana’s current price action remains bullish as long as it sustains support above this mark.  Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High – Smart Money Accumulation? Solana’s ability to turn former resistance into a support base reflects increased demand, which could act as a catalyst for further upward momentum. The market is closely monitoring these movements, and the next few days are expected to be crucial for Solana. If SOL maintains its trajectory above $171, it may spark optimism for an extended uptrend. Investors will likely keep a close eye on Solana’s price dynamics, as any shift below this level could alter the short-term outlook for one of crypto’s most promising assets. Solana Testing Liquidity Top investor Carl Runefelt recently shared his insights on X, highlighting the significance of Solana’s head and shoulders pattern. In his analysis, Runefelt noted that a successful neckline retest would confirm the bullish trend’s strength.  Runefelt’s chart analysis further indicates that as long as SOL remains above the neckline, bullish momentum is expected to persist, with his target price set at $202 in the short term. This potential upward movement has caught the attention of both investors and traders who are looking at the $202 level as an achievable target if the current bullish trend continues. Runefelt’s analysis underscores that the neckline acts as a critical support level—one that, if maintained, could drive strong buying interest. However, any break below this neckline could shift the momentum, potentially leading to a more cautious outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data – STH Overheating? With the head and shoulders structure forming, Solana’s price action will be crucial in the next few days. A successful retest of the neckline could fuel continued growth, possibly pushing SOL to new highs. SOL Price Action Solana (SOL) is trading at $172, steadily climbing as it targets a higher supply zone. To maintain this bullish momentum, SOL bulls need to push the price above the critical $180 resistance level. This $180 mark acts as a key resistance, and breaking it could potentially trigger a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out) buying, which would drive the price even higher. This psychological level may attract increased interest from traders who see a clear breakout as a signal for more gains. However, maintaining this bullish trend is essential. If SOL cannot maintain support above $171, a retracement to lower demand zones is likely. This move could bring SOL back to test support levels closer to previous lows, possibly slowing down the current momentum. Related Reading: Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‘Send SOL To The Moon’ – Crypto Analyst For traders and investors watching closely, the next moves around the $171 and $180 levels are key indicators. A strong push past $180 could suggest continued strength in Solana’s price action. A drop below $171 would signal weakness, indicating a temporary pause or pullback in the recent rally.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin UTXO Surpasses COVID 2020 Levels To New ATH – Is This Good Or Bad For Price?,2024-10-27 05:30:27+00:00,"Bitcoin’s consolidation below $68,000 extended throughout this week, with bulls holding steady above the $66,000 support level. Although the cryptocurrency hasn’t seen a significant push to the upside, its ability to avoid a deeper correction means that Bitcoin remains on track to end October on a bullish note. Related Reading: Against All Odds: Solana (SOL) Breaks Past $176 In 3-Month Push In support of this outlook, a crypto analyst has highlighted an emerging trend in Bitcoin’s UTXO metric, which suggests a looming breakout in the crypto’s price. UTXO In Loss Reaches Highest Point Ever The number of Bitcoin UTXO in losses recently reached a new peak on September 11, 2024, surpassing levels last seen during the COVID-19 crash in 2020 and the September 2023 market bottom.  This metric, known as Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), refers to the amount of Bitcoin that remains unspent in a Bitcoin wallet after a transaction. When UTXO is measured in loss, it reflects the number of Bitcoin holdings that would currently sell at a loss compared to the last transaction price from the Bitcoin wallet. According to Glassnode data, the number of UTXO in losses spiked massively in September to surpass previous numbers, indicating that a significant portion of active Bitcoin addresses are underwater. However, while this may appear to signal bearish sentiment at first glance, history has shown this isn’t the case. As pointed out by crypto analyst CryptoCon, major spikes in UTXO loss don’t come right before terrible price action, but they mostly come at the end of it. Keeping this trend in mind, the new peak in September most likely was an inflection point for Bitcoin’s price action for the rest of the year. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? Past data reveals a consistent pattern: when UTXO in loss reaches extreme highs, Bitcoin’s price is often near a reversal. For instance, during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, UTXO in loss spiked significantly, followed by a strong rally that led Bitcoin to new all-time highs in the following months.  The last time the UTXO in loss spiked massively was in September 2023, serving as the forerunner for the latest bull market cycle which kicked off in October 2023. This run culminated in a new all-time high for Bitcoin in March 2024, effectively showcasing spikes in the UTXO in loss as a signal of positive market momentum. If history were to repeat itself, the September spike in the UTXO loss numbers could also signal a market bottom, which in turn opens up the stage for a rally in the rest of the year.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Price To $24? Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens,2024-10-27 04:00:56+00:00,"A crypto analyst has forecasted a massive price surge for Dogecoin (DOGE), predicting that the king of meme coins will hit a whopping $24 in the near term. While this price target may seem ambitious with Dogecoin currently trading below $1, the analyst has remained confident, indicating that a surge to this target would shock skeptics.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Inflows Soar 555% In 3 Months – Will The Momentum Continue? Dogecoin Eyes $24 Price Target  The Dogecoin price has been trading below $1 for years now, experiencing significant price fluctuations as it attempts to break out of key resistance levels and move past current bearish positions. In contrast to Shiba Inu (SHIB), its top meme coin competitor which has seen impressive gains recently, Dogecoin has experienced substantial price declines that have left a few investors no choice but to liquidate their holdings.  Amidst this bearish trend, a crypto analyst, identified as ‘CEO’ on X (formerly Twitter) has rekindled optimism among Dogecoin community members with a new bullish prediction for the cryptocurrency. The analyst has shared what he describes as the “ultimate Dogecoin chart,” where he projects that the meme coin could reach $24 soon. In the Dogecoin chart, the analyst disclosed the cryptocurrency’s past price movements, highlighting two instances where the meme coin experienced prolonged bearish trends before breaking out into a massive price surge. Based on Dogecoin’s current price action it seems the meme coin is displaying similar historical conditions that suggest that a bull rally might be imminent. And according to the CEO, this potential bull rally could see DOGE hitting $24.  Is A $24 Dogecoin Price Increase Possible?   Given how lofty a $24 price for Dogecoin might seem, the CEO has acknowledged that many people would doubt such a bullish outcome. Nevertheless, he expressed strong confidence in this prediction, asserting that Dogecoin skeptics will be proven wrong when the meme coin reaches this milestone.  With Dogecoin’s price presently trading at $0.13, it’s understandable why many investors would be skeptical of the meme coin reaching a $24 price target. Achieving this ambitious milestone would require the king of meme coins to surge approximately 18,362% from its current price — an extraordinary leap that would likely occur during periods of intense demand and bullish sentiments typically seen during strong bull markets.  In addition to this, a $24 price surge for Dogecoin would also require its market capitalization to reach trillions of dollars. As of writing, Dogecoin’s market cap sits at $19.6 billion, meaning it would need to surpass Bitcoin’s market capitalization which is currently $1.3 trillion to hit this price level.  Related Reading: Against All Odds: Solana (SOL) Breaks Past $176 In 3-Month Push Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price has experienced a 6.41% decrease over the past seven days and another 4.37% decline in the last 24 hours.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High – Smart Money Accumulation?,2024-10-27 02:30:09+00:00,"Ethereum has experienced a sharp retrace, dropping over 13% since Monday and stirring concerns among investors who had anticipated a breakout. This sudden pullback, which took ETH as low as $2,380 on Friday, has injected a sense of worry into the market, leaving many to question the strength of its recent rally. However, on-chain data from Santiment reveals an intriguing development—whale activity in Ethereum surged to a six-week high just as the price dipped. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally This spike in large transactions suggests potential accumulation by whales, a pattern often viewed as a bullish signal when occurring near key support levels. Historically, significant whale buying during downturns hints at confidence in a future recovery, as these large holders tend to seek undervalued assets with high potential. The next few days will be critical for Ethereum as investors await signs of stabilization or further decline. A solid hold above recent lows could set the stage for a rebound, while a failure to maintain support may reinforce bearish sentiment. For now, all eyes remain on Ethereum’s price movements, as well as on whale behavior, which could provide insights into Ethereum’s direction in the near term. Ethereum Preparing For A Rally? Despite Ethereum’s recent price retracement, sentiment among investors and analysts remains bullish for the near future. According to key data from crypto analysis platform Santiment, Ethereum’s whale activity reached a six-week high as the price declined to $2,380 on Friday.  Historically, such a spike in activity from whales—large stakeholders with substantial capital—signals accumulation. When whales begin to accumulate, it’s often an indicator of renewed confidence, suggesting these key players see long-term value at current prices. While an immediate price rebound isn’t guaranteed, this pattern is encouraging. Major accumulation phases typically happen in periods of price weakness or extended consolidation, laying the foundation for potential upward movement.  Ethereum’s price action has been lackluster in recent months, with ETH struggling to break out despite occasional bullish sentiment. Some analysts suggest this may be due to heavy accumulation dynamics led by institutional or “smart money” investors who gradually increase their holdings during periods of low momentum. Related Reading: Number Of Bitcoin Bulls Increases As Funding Rate Shows Steady Growth – Details As whales increase their activity, it’s a potential sign that Ethereum is gearing up for a stronger move once accumulation is completed. With support from high-cap stakeholders, Ethereum’s price may eventually reflect this renewed confidence.  For now, investors are closely watching for consolidation near key support levels, which could provide the basis for a breakout. If whale accumulation continues in the coming weeks, it could drive upward momentum, validating the long-term bullish outlook shared by many analysts and investors. ETH Price Action Ethereum is currently trading at $2,466 after a pullback from the $2,550 level, indicating a struggle to maintain bullish momentum. This retracement has brought ETH closer to its recent local lows but still within a sideways pattern, preserving a slightly bullish outlook as it hovers above key support areas. For Ethereum bulls to regain control, a push above $2,550 is critical. Breaking this level would signal renewed strength and allow ETH to target the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,783. Achieving this would mark a new local high, potentially reinforcing bullish sentiment among investors. However, if Ethereum’s price fails to rise in the coming days, the likelihood of prolonged consolidation or even a deeper correction increases. Such a scenario would likely introduce additional bearish pressure, with ETH potentially revisiting previous support levels as traders reassess the market’s direction.  Related Reading: On-Chain Indicator Signals Bitcoin Cycle Top Is Far Ahead – Data Confirms Bullish Outlook For now, Ethereum’s price action is delicately balanced, with the $2,550 level and the 200-day EMA representing crucial milestones for bulls aiming to sustain an uptrend in the near term.

While the pioneer cryptocurrency has been slowly recovering from bearish trends to reach the $70,000 mark, a rally to $200,000 would mark a historical milestone and a new All-Time-High (ATH) for BTC.  Technical Pattern Signals $200,000 Rally Ahead Popular crypto analyst, Mags has unveiled a new technical pattern in the Bitcoin price chart. According to his post on X (formerly Twitter), Bitcoin is currently forming “a massive cup and handle pattern,” indicating a potential for a major rally.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means Mags revealed that the Bitcoin price has just moved past the handle portion in the technical pattern, indicating a positive signal for a breakout that could start a bullish phase. As its name suggests, a Cup and Handle pattern is a key technical chart pattern that resembles a cup and handle. In this chart pattern, the cup is in the shape of a U and is considered a bullish signal, while the handle represents a slight downward drift, which indicates a potential buying opportunity to go long.  Mags observed that since Bitcoin has just broken past the handle, the next level is to watch the “neckline” which serves as a resistance point. If Bitcoin can break through the neckline, it’s price could surge dramatically or like the analyst says “go vertical.” This bull rally could see Bitcoin’s price driving towards $200,000, marking a new all time high for the cryptocurrency. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $66,972, reflecting a slight 2.02% decrease in the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. While Mags has projected a $200,000 price increase for Bitcoin, the analyst has also forecasted even higher price targets in previous X posts, suggesting that a $200,000 price level may be conservative for the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin Price Peak Set At $300,000 In another X post on October 24, Mags disclosed that Bitcoin is about to enter its price discovery, suggesting an imminent breakout to new levels. Price discovery is the process by which an asset’s true market value is determined, and for Bitcoin, it suggests when its price could reach fresh highs.   Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin And Solana, Is $12,000 Possible? Sharing a historical Bitcoin price chart, the analyst pinpointed instances where the cryptocurrency entered a price discovery before reaching a peak. In 2014, BTC hit a peak, then bottomed out in 2015 before reaching another price high in 2018. A similar price action occurred between 2019 and 2024, with BTC achieving a bottom in 2019 and peaking in 2021.  Following this historical price trend, Mags indicated that Bitcoin hit its bottom in 2023 and is now about to enter its price discovery. Once the cryptocurrency does, it could signal a surge to a new all-time high, which Mags has set at an impressive $300,000.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Related Reading: Against All Odds: Solana (SOL) Breaks Past $176 In 3-Month Push Impact Of Whale Accumulation Crypto analysts said that one of the positive impacts of whales buying large volumes of Bitcoin is it helps stabilize the market. As a result, the crypto’s price could go down a little bit or become more stable. Reducing the volume of Bitcoin in the market could possibly make prices less susceptible to volatility. In previous whale accumulations, it was observed that BTC price usually behaves in a specific way, in which on most occasions, BTC goes flat or slightly decreases. This period of BTC accumulation could also signal that whales have no immediate intent to sell their digital assets. It might be an indicator that whales are looking at capitalizing on Bitcoin in the long term so the accumulation phase is a strategic move. Real Indicator Of Bitcoin Growth CryptoQuant said the whale accumulation could be seen as the ‘calm before the storm’ in the long term, saying that Bitcoin prices move sideways or experience a moderate fall during the accumulation phase. However, CryptoQuant noted that there is no doubt that in the long run, this is an ‘optimistic sign.’ Whales’ holdings are at an all-time high “Whales currently hold around 670,000 $BTC, which is the highest value ever. Undoubtedly, this is an optimistic long-term sign.” – By @BaroVirtual Full post 👇https://t.co/MoFLpZ3Rmh pic.twitter.com/7esCP6fVBE — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 24, 2024 The crypto analyst said that the ‘real’ growth in Bitcoin happened after the whales decided to dispose of their holdings and reached a negative percentage change value. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s price movement during the accumulation phase usually paved the way for significant growth in BTC. “Historically, after whales reduce their holdings and a negative percentage change is reached, a strong surge in Bitcoin prices often follows,” CoinNess Global said in a post. Whales hold record 670K BTC, analysts expect possible surge According to CryptoQuant analyst BaroVirtual, whales currently hold approximately 670,000 Bitcoin (BTC)—the highest level on record.

However, some investors are betting that no matter who wins the coveted seat in the White House, Bitcoin price will experience an upsurge and potentially hit $80,000 by November.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data – STH Overheating?,2024-10-26 22:00:11+00:00,"Bitcoin has had a volatile week, with its price fluctuating between a local high of $69,500 and a low of $65,000. Following weeks of strong bullish momentum, the market has now cooled, and BTC is consolidating just below the crucial $70,000 level. This key threshold is seen as a trigger for intensified buying pressure if Bitcoin manages to break above it. Related Reading: Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‘Send SOL To The Moon’ – Crypto Analyst According to CryptoQuant data, there’s still room for further growth, as short-term holder (STH) coins are trading at a 6.2% net asset value (NAV) premium. This premium is often viewed as a gauge of market sentiment, reflecting the optimism of short-term holders who are willing to pay above the current market value to acquire Bitcoin. A higher NAV premium generally suggests that investors expect continued price appreciation and are positioning themselves for future gains. As BTC stabilizes in its current range, all eyes are on the $70,000 mark as a potential breakout level that could pave the way for a fresh rally. With positive market sentiment and supportive data, Bitcoin’s outlook for the coming weeks remains encouraging, fueled by both technical signals and strong buyer interest. Retail Buying Bitcoin (Again) Bitcoin is experiencing growing demand from short-term holders as its price consolidates below key supply levels, close to all-time highs. Analyst Axler Adler recently shared critical insights on X, showing that Bitcoin’s net asset value (NAV) premium among short-term holders has climbed to 6.2%. This 6.2% NAV premium indicates that Bitcoin’s current market price is trading 6.2% above the average acquisition cost for short-term holders. Essentially, these investors are valuing Bitcoin at a premium, suggesting optimism about the potential for further gains.  Adler explains that this metric acts as a bullish signal, highlighting room for continued price growth. An NAV premium of 25% or higher typically points to an overheated market, implying that demand has yet to reach excessive levels. According to Adler’s analysis, the NAV premium is an important gauge of market sentiment. A moderate premium like 6.2% reflects healthy demand among short-term holders, aligning with an accumulation phase rather than a peak. This is especially relevant as Bitcoin’s price consolidates under significant resistance levels, potentially setting the stage for a breakout.  Related Reading: On-Chain Indicator Signals Bitcoin Cycle Top Is Far Ahead – Data Confirms Bullish Outlook Bitcoin’s consolidation below its key supply levels and rising demand among short-term holders reflects a favorable environment for potential price appreciation. If short-term holder demand continues to grow, it could fuel BTC’s ascent to new highs. The balance between premium demand and manageable NAV levels could signal sustained upward momentum. There is a potential rally on the horizon if buying pressure strengthens at current levels. Technical Level To Watch  Bitcoin is trading at $66,900 after establishing solid support around $65,000. The price action signals resilience as it consolidates above this crucial level. This support around $65,000 marks a significant pivot, as holding above it reflects underlying strength and fuels optimism among investors. However, for Bitcoin to keep bullish momentum, a push above $70,000 is essential to confirm the uptrend. If Bitcoin loses the $65,000 level, analysts foresee a retrace toward the 200-day moving average (MA) at $63,274. This level is relevant as a long-term support zone. A pullback to this area could attract new buyers, reinforcing it as a major support if tested. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally Investors view the 200-day MA as a key anchor for Bitcoin’s bullish structure. If BTC can hold above $65,000 and eventually break $70,000, it would indicate a continuation of the current bullish phase. Conversely, a dip below these supports would shift focus to the 200-day MA. Holding above this moving average is crucial to prevent a bearish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Retail lnvestors Remain Cautious Despite Price Gain – Details,2024-10-26 20:30:03+00:00,"Following its bearish start to October, Bitcoin has since shifted momentum, rising as high as $69,000 in the last two weeks. Despite this significant price rally, Bitcoin retail investors remain hesitant to engage the market. In its weekly crypto report on Friday, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shared an interesting insight into this low retail activity in the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 70%+ Powerful Bull Wave To Push It Over $100,000, How High Can It Go? Bitcoin Retail Investors’ Holding Grows At Historically Slow Pace – Report According to CryptoQuant, retail investors’ holdings have grown by 18,000 BTC valued at $1.2 billion over the last four months reaching a total new value of 1.753 million BTC worth $112.7 billion. While this development demonstrates a rising market interest by these small investors, the analytic firm notes the pace of accumulation is significantly slow compared to historical data as retail investors only acquired a net 1,000 BTC valued at $66.31 million, in the last 30 days.  Notably, the retail investor accumulation rate has been on a consistent decline since May 2023, when their holdings rose by 27,000 BTC worth $1.79 billion  Therefore, CryptoQuant reports that these Bitcoin individual investors have only increased their investments by 30,000 BTC valued at $1.99 billion in 2024, which pales in comparison to the whale investors whose holdings have grown by 173,000 BTC worth $11.50 billion in the same period.  During periods of price gain, low retail investor activity as discussed above can be concerning as it represents decreased market liquidity or even a lack of market confidence in the asset’s ability to sustain its current bullish trajectory.  Alternatively, this lack of interest from small-scale investors also presents positive indications. For example, CryptoQuant reports that low retail activity includes these small investors holding onto their Bitcoin rather than selling. The analytics firm notes that Bitcoin transfer to exchange in January 2023 has decreased from a daily average of 2,700 BTC to 1,400 BTC in 2024, thus there is reduced selling pressure on the token.  In addition, transfer activity among retail investors remains low, with transaction volume dropping to $326 million on September 21, the lowest level recorded since 2020. While reduced transfer activity may indicate limited market volatility, CryptoQuant states that low retail activity has historically preceded significant price gains for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at 66,896 following a 1.11% decline in the last day due to reports of an alleged investigation into Tether, the issuer of stablecoin USDT, and conflict in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume is up by 34.29% and is valued at $42.10 billion.

First up, we successfully launched and sold all 2,222 NFTs! This is a huge milestone for us, and we’ve raised a ton of money that’s now going directly into our marketing efforts. The enthusiasm around these NFTs has been incredible, and it’s really solidified our community. (you should check them out on tensor, they will be worth a ton once dividents start😉) 

With the funds from the NFT sales, we’re ramping up our marketing push big time. We recently signed a deal with a top-notch marketing agency that’s going to help us expand our reach and get the word out about Hegecoin like never before. Their experience and network will be crucial in bringing our project to a broader audience and attracting more investors.

Plus, our VC has been ramping up buys lately, which shows that people believe in our vision and are ready to support us. The combination of our NFT success, strong financial backing, VC investments, and a strategic marketing plan makes this an exciting time to be involved with Hegecoin.

So, if you’re looking for a project that’s growing and has a bright future, now’s the time to check us out! Let’s keep building together!",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,solana,What’s the point of copy trading?,2024-10-26 17:48:25,"I’ve been watching several successful wallets and building some automation for copy trading. Here’s one thing I don’t get and I hope someone can help me understand. 

So let’s assume I have all the infra in place to perform extremely fast txs. I hook it up with one of the good wallets and start copying. The problem is the moment this wallet buys it pushes the token price up. The moment it sells - it makes the token price go down. So no matter how fast are your txs, even if you somehow end up landing your tx in the same block as the wallet you’re watching you’re still buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price than the wallet in question. 

So if this wallet is marking, say, 30% on each of those trades - you’ll be making inherently less. If that’s the case then what’s the point of copy trading in general? Am I missing anything?

Reddit,solana,$BTCAT: The First Cat Ever Immortalized on the Blockchain,2024-10-27 12:06:19,"$BTCAT emerges as a unique blend of art, decentralization, and community-driven governance. It serves not just as a financial asset but as a significant piece of blockchain history that reflects the creativity and pioneering spirit of early crypto enthusiasts.

**TLDR:**

* **FIRST** **EVER** cat found on any blockchain (2013)
* Dev BURNED 4.4% of supply and disappeared
* Whale group of 50+ ***Cat****victed*  leaders
* **Whale group locked up 10%+ for 3-6 months**
* Over **7k holders** and growing
* Strong community and meme
* Coinmarketcap pending...
* Over 70% pull back from ATH (standard growth)
* Most importantly CAT SEASON!

**Riding the “Cat Season” Wave:**

With its roots as the first cat on any blockchain, $BTCAT is ideally positioned to capitalize on the current trend of cat-themed tokens, particularly gaining traction on the Solana blockchain. As “cat season” unfolds, $BTCAT stands out among its peers, ready to harness the momentum of this playful yet serious movement.

**The First Cat on Blockchain:**

The journey of $BTCAT traces back to an ASCII art cat embedded in Block ID 322,917, created by an early miner. This cat represents the first-ever feline immortalized on a blockchain, a notable milestone in crypto culture. It is preserved in the “Messages from the Mines” archive, serving as a testament to the innovative spirit that has characterized blockchain technology since its inception.

**Decentralization and Community Governance:**

$BTCAT champions true decentralization by allowing the community to take the reins. **Following the example of Bitcoin’s creator, its original developer burned 4.4% of the token supply and exited the project, empowering holders to shape its future collectively.** This democratic structure encourages active participation in decision-making, marketing, and development.

**Tokenomics and Future Outlook:**

**The tokenomics of $BTCAT feature a strategic distribution model, locking 9.1% of the total supply among stakeholders to ensure alignment with long-term objectives.** This fosters a united community with shared interests, poised for growth as it navigates the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

$BTCAT embodies more than just a cryptocurrency; it represents a cultural movement rooted in the legacy of early crypto pioneers. With its community-driven approach and historical significance, $BTCAT is set to flourish as the landscape of digital assets continues to evolve.

* 14,800 unauthorized transactions in just 2 hours
* €16,000 stolen through crypto sales and BICO pump & dump scheme
* All security measures were active, including 2FA with Passkey

# ⚠️ What Makes This Case EXTREMELY Concerning:

1. Account accessed WITHOUT:
   * Email breach (verified by Google logs)
   * Phone breach
   * SIM swap
   * Password change (accessed with SAME password after the attack)
   * 2FA confirmation (iPhone with Passkey was in airplane mode)
2. Coinbase Security COMPLETELY Failed:
   * No alerts for 14,800 suspicious transactions
   * No detection of unauthorized trading
   * No response to obvious pump & dump scheme
   * No security logs during the attack period

# 🔍 Investigation Findings:

1. Immediate Actions Taken:
   * Secured remaining funds
   * Reported to Police
   * Contacted Coinbase
   * Changed all passwords
   * Enhanced security measures
2. Coinbase's Authentication Logs Reveal:
   * ZERO logs during the attack
   * Significant gaps and contradictions
   * Missing device confirmations
   * Unauthorized US IPs accessing account DAYS AFTER security upgrade

# 🚩 Red Flags in Coinbase's Response:

* Refuses to explain how 14,800 trades bypassed security
* Can't explain missing authentication logs
* No explanation for unauthorized US IP access
* Security protocols (detailed here: https://www.coinbase.com/de/blog/earning-user-trust-with-our-secure-login-service) COMPLETELY failed

# ❓ Critical Questions Coinbase Won't Answer:

1. How were thousands of trades executed without ANY security alerts?
2. Why are authentication logs missing during the attack?
3. How was 2FA/Passkey bypassed?
4. Why were unauthorized US IPs accessing the account after security upgrade?
5. How was a massive pump & dump scheme not detected?

# 🎯 Key Takeaways:

* Internal security breach highly likely
* Multiple security layers simultaneously failed
* Logging systems compromised or deliberately bypassed
* ALL Coinbase users potentially at risk

# ⚡ Call to Action:

* Check your Coinbase security logs for gaps
* Document any suspicious activities
* Share similar experiences
* Report security concerns to authorities

# 🔄 Next Steps:

* Investigation ongoing
* Legal actions being considered
* Regulatory authorities notified
* Will update as new evidence emerges

All incidents reported to authorities. Documentation available (sensitive info redacted). Updates will be posted.",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026
Reddit,solana,[GUIDE] Inside the Secret World of Alpha Groups,2024-10-25 09:14:37,"### (And Why 99% of Them Are Pure Exit Liquidity)

Sup degens! 

Let me start this off with one simple sentence that changed my entire view on shitcoin trading: 
> ***If you can't spot who's exit liquidity is being hunted, it's probably yours.***

Today I'm pulling back the curtain on one of crypto's most misunderstood phenomena: signal groups. 

### Understanding the Game

First things first: shitcoin trading is PvP. You're not fighting the market - you're fighting other traders. And just like in any competitive game, there are different leagues.

  

Whales play against whales. Mid-sized traders battle other mid-sized traders. Small fish... well, they sometimes fight other small fish, other times ride waves caused by whales, but most often become lunch for the bigger fish. Understanding which league you're in and how to play the rules is crucial for survival.

  

Take token launches for example. When you see a ""whale"" suddenly aping into a new token, that's rarely what actually happened. Those transactions are almost always pre-planned and bot-executed, often with validator tips to ensure they get in before anyone else. (If you want to learn more how tipping validators to prioritize your transactions works, lemme know in the comments - I can write a whole guide about it on its own)

### The Food Chain

The crypto information stream for successful coins works like a food chain. Here's how it flows:

  

1. DEVS - They sitat the very top. They're crucial at launch since they create the token and set initial parameters. But post-launch, their influence varies widely. Some remain major players, actively managing their token's trajectory. Others become mere spectators as market forces take over. Look at $WIF - even the devs admitted they were surprised by its success. 
  

2. INSIDERS - early investors and project partners. These folks often end up wielding more influence than the devs, especially if they're holding major bags. They're the first to know about upcoming listings, marketing pushes, or whale movements. Oftentimes, they are whales themselves. 
  

3. ALPHA GROUPS - We're talking small, private circles of maybe 10-20 people max. These aren't your typical ""VIP signal groups."" These are the quiet chat rooms where someone casually drops ""Hey, Robert is launching his token next week, Mason will be putting $300k in it. We’re keeping the tokens across 3 weeks, then dipping completely"" or ""Major partnership announcement with Jupiter coming in 3 days, it should get the ball rolling"" No rocket emojis, no hype - just pure, actionable intel. 
  

4. BETA GROUPS - This is where most of the traders live. Let me paint you a picture: You join a ""VIP signals"" group with 1000 members. The admin posts ""🚨 HUGE ALERT: $RETARDERO is about to moon! Get in now! 🚀"" What they don't tell you is they got that info from an alpha group and bought an hour ago. By the time you see it, you're basically buying their bags. 
  

5. EXIT LIQUIDITY GROUPS -  I call these the ""reverse indicators."" When they say buy, dump. When they say dump, buy. They're usually run by devs or bot makers with their own nodes who use their members as exit liquidity. They'll pump a token, alert their group to buy, then dump on them. Rinse and repeat. If you’re getting calls and the price goes down when you buy and up when you sell - congrats, you’re the exit liquidity.  

### Finding Legitimate Groups

Let's cut through the bullshit and talk about what actually works to get into legitimate groups, and it all starts with networking.

Face-to-face networking is hands down the most effective way in. Attend crypto conferences and local meetups - especially the smaller ones where you can actually have real conversations. 

The best alphas I've ever seen across the years were shared over beers at local crypto meetups, not in paid Discord groups. Something about meeting in person builds trust that's hard to replicate online.

But what if you’re not comfortable with IRL networking? Fair enough - plenty of degens aren't. 

There are ways that can bring you to these circles and I’ve tried a bunch of them across the years. Here are my top choices: 

- Moderate Discord servers for promising projects and communities 
- Help manage social media for crypto projects 
- Edit content for established crypto YouTubers 
- Volunteer to be an assistant of a whale  
- Create educational content on Reddit (hey, like what I'm doing!) 

Notice how none of these involve begging for signals or spamming rocket emojis!

The most important thing to understand is that value comes first, relationships second, and alpha third. Whether you're networking in person or online, you need to bring something to the table. Maybe it's market insights, maybe it's community support, maybe it's technical knowledge. The specific path matters less than the value you're creating.

### Reality Check

Remember: this is a zero-sum game. For every winner, there's a loser. The people at the top aren't trying to help you - they're trying to profit from you. That ""alpha group"" charging you 1 SOL for membership? They're making more money from membership fees than from their calls.

  

The real alpha doesn't come in the form of ""buy this now"" signals. It comes from understanding market dynamics, building genuine relationships, and positioning yourself to spot opportunities early.

### The Bottom Line

Signal groups are just one part of a complex ecosystem. The valuable ones aren't selling subscriptions - they're private circles of people sharing information because they all benefit from the shared knowledge.

  

Focus on building real relationships and providing actual value to the community. That's how you move up the food chain.

  

Stay frosty, degens. And remember what I said at the beginning:

Reddit,solana,"Side-by-Side Comparison of BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL Liquid Staking Tokens for Solana",2024-10-26 05:19:15,"Alright, if you’re into staking on Solana but still want to keep things liquid, you’ve probably come across BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL. These tokens basically let you earn staking rewards while staying flexible with your assets. I did a little digging, so here’s a quick comparison to help you figure out which one might suit you best.

# Estimated APR & Earnings

* **BGSOL**: This one’s got a solid base APR of **8.15%**, but with extra incentives from Bitget, it can hit **30.15%**. Plus, if you stake the first **$1,000** via Bitget Wallet on the Solayer Restaking Network, you can earn **up to 25% APY**. Not too shabby, right?
* **BNSOL**: The APR here is **dynamic**, but Binance hasn’t shared exact numbers (thanks, Binance 🙄).
* **bbSOL**: No fees at all – **0% management fee, 0% validator commission,** and **0% withdrawal fees**. The only cost is a **0.1% SOL deposit fee**. So if you're allergic to fees, bbSOL might be the move.

# Redemption & Liquidity

* **BGSOL**: No lock-in period – you can **redeem whenever** you feel like it.
* **BNSOL**: There’s a **4-day wait** if you want to convert BNSOL back to SOL.
* **bbSOL**: It’s **tradeable** on Bybit and other exchanges. The info I found didn’t say if there’s a waiting period, so it seems pretty chill on that front.

# Where You Can Use These Tokens

* **BGSOL**: Works across a bunch of DeFi platforms like **Orca Dex, Solayer, Kamino**, and **Save Lending**. Also gets you access to Bitget’s **LaunchPool and PoolX**, plus potential **airdrops**.
* **BNSOL**: Mostly useful on **Binance** for **trading, lending**, or adding to **liquidity pools**.
* **bbSOL**: You can use it with **Orca, Kamino**, and **Solayer** – nice little DeFi ecosystem going on here.

# What Makes Each One Special

* **BGSOL**: Comes with **Active Validator Set (AVS) delegation**, making it faster and more secure.
* **BNSOL**: Super simple with a **one-click staking process** and the usual Binance-level security and support.
* **bbSOL**: It’s the **first exchange-backed LST** and runs on the **SPL stake pool program**, which has gone through a bunch of audits.

# So, Which One’s Right for You?

Honestly, it all comes down to what you’re after:

* If you want **higher APR** and more **DeFi options**, go with **BGSOL**.
* If you’re already using **Binance** a lot, **BNSOL** makes sense.
* If you hate fees and like **trading your tokens freely**, **bbSOL** is the way to go.

So yeah, for me BGSOL really seems to steal the spotlight, especially if you’re looking for high rewards, flexibility, and utility. What do you guys think? Let me know would love to hear your thoughts!

Reddit,solana,I need help with marketing the memecoin that I am planning to launch in a few days.,2024-10-25 23:16:51,"I hate coins with no utility. That's why I wanted to create mine and make a change in the ecosystem as much as I can. I created a coin with a game behind it. The game is very simple and easy to play and you earn tokens as you score in the game. Players will be paid out at the end of every day. The game is ready and working, got a few people to join the tg and test it but can't seem to go further than that.

  
We tried facebook ads but can't get it working as they keep suspending our account. Will start doing X Ads today as well as posting tweets for organic growth. Moreover, we also post tiktoks from various accounts showing the game. However, all these do not bring any traction.

  
I've spent days to creating the game and making sure that it runs perfectly. Therefore, I do not want my efforts turn into nothing so I'm afraid of launching the token. 

  
I know that people will like the project when they check it out (we have a game and proper tokenomics while coins with dog pfps do 1000x) but the issue is; I can't get them to check the game out.

  
Are there any marketing strategies that you guys suggest? I am down to pay influencers to shill about it. But the influencers I get in my TG group or X dms do not appear to be legit.

  
Would really appreciate if someone with knowladge gives me some tips and tricks as I really want this to work.",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

### ⛏️ Steel v2

Steel has announced v2 of the development framework, focusing on simplifying common tasks in Solana development. 

Here's a breakdown of the key updates:

* **Event Logging**: The event! macro now supports simple logging for all events, allowing developers to easily encode and publish event data using \`sol\_log\`. 
* **Lamport Transfers**: Steel v2 introduces helper functions that simplify the process of collecting and sending lamports between accounts, making SOL transfers a one-line operation.
* **Closing Accounts**: There's now a one-line function to close program-owned accounts and return rent lamports to the user, streamlining account management.
* **SPL Token Management**: New helper functions have been added to handle basic SPL token operations like minting, transferring, burning, and freezing tokens with ease.

The team behind Steel is inviting developers to contribute to the project by [submitting PRs ](https://github.com/regolith-labs/steel?ref=blog.colosseum.org)for review.

### 📰 State of Crypto Report 2024

The recently released State of Crypto 2024 report by a16z crypto offers an in-depth look at the current trends shaping the crypto industry, with a spotlight on the remarkable growth of the Solana ecosystem.

The report highlights how crypto activity and usage have reached unprecedented levels, and Solana has been a significant contributor to this surge.

In September 2024, the number of monthly active crypto addresses hit an all-time high of 220 million.

Notably, Solana accounted for approximately 100 million of these active addresses, underscoring its rapid adoption and usage.

Builder interest in Solana has seen a substantial increase. The share of founders who are building on or interested in Solana grew to 11.2% this year, up from 5.1% last year—the largest increase among all blockchains.

While Ethereum still leads with 20.8% of total builder interest, Solana's growth rate suggests a narrowing gap and highlights the network's appeal to developers seeking high-performance platforms.

Several major themes from the report resonate with the developments within the Solana ecosystem:

**Crypto Activity and Adoption**: Global crypto usage is at an all-time high, with mobile wallet users reaching 29 million in June 2024. The growth is not confined to traditional markets; countries like Nigeria, India, and Argentina are experiencing significant adoption due to factors like currency devaluation and increasing mobile penetration.

**Political Engagement**: Crypto has emerged as a key political issue ahead of the U.S. election, with increased interest observed in swing states. Regulatory milestones, such as the approval of Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products and the passage of the FIT21 Act, indicate growing governmental engagement with the crypto sector.

**Stablecoins and Payments**: Stablecoins have found a strong product-market fit, facilitating fast, low-cost global transactions. In Q2 2024, stablecoins processed $8.5 trillion in transactions, surpassing traditional payment networks like Visa.

**Infrastructure Advancements**: Technological improvements have significantly increased blockchain capacity while reducing transaction costs. For Solana, known for its high throughput and low fees, these advancements reinforce its position as an attractive platform for developers.

**Growth of DeFi**: Decentralized finance continues to expand, offering alternatives to traditional financial systems. With over $169 billion locked in DeFi protocols across blockchains, there's a growing opportunity for developers to innovate in areas like staking, lending, and decentralized exchanges on Solana's network.

**Crypto and AI Intersection**: The report highlights how blockchain technology can address challenges in artificial intelligence, such as verifying data authenticity, democratizing access to computational resources, and ensuring transparent, user-owned services.

**Emergence of New Applications**: Enhanced scalability has unlocked a wave of new on-chain applications. The evolution of NFTs from speculative assets to components of social collecting experiences illustrates this shift. Additionally, the rise of decentralized social networks and on-chain games is opening fresh opportunities for engagement.

The State of Crypto 2024 report underscores the potential of Solana. The significant increase in active users and developer interest signals an environment ripe for innovation where developers are uniquely positioned to shape the future of dApps, DeFi, and more.

### 🗳️ Launching the New Realms Ecosystem

Realms, a hub for DAO governance on Solana, is spinning out of Solana Labs and transitioning to new management under Realms Today Trust.

Realms, originally developed by Solana Labs, is now being managed by a new team, including former Solana Labs engineer Sebastian Bor and other experienced DAO professionals.

The new entity will develop a forked version of the popular SPL-Governance program and continue supporting the DAO needs of major protocols.

This spin-out is designed to provide more tailored and professional services to DAOs in the Solana ecosystem, while maintaining the core governance tools as free public goods.

Some of the key benefits for developers and projects include:

* **Customization**: Realms will now focus on building multiple front-ends specifically tailored to different use cases.
* **Support Services**: Realms will offer advisory services to help DAOs set up governance structures, incorporate legal entities, and create bank accounts.
* **Sustainable Funding**: The creation of the Realms Ecosystem DAO (R.E.D.) will distribute $200,000 in grants to upstart DAOs, encouraging innovation and community-led governance projects.

Several new tools and services are being introduced as part of this new phase including DAO Advisory Services, Credit Card, and Customizable Frontends.

Also announced the Realms Ecosystem DAO (RED, a decentralized grants program that will fund DAOs on Solana, and the Realms Accelerator to support entrepreneurs in leveraging SPL-Governance programs to bring new ideas into the DAO landscape.

These new tools and services will make it easier for developers and projects to adopt decentralized governance while providing them with much-needed support to handle legal, financial, and operational challenges.

Reddit,solana,"[GUIDE] Liquidity Pools and Slippage: The Good, The Bad and The Rekt",2024-10-23 15:16:12,"Yo degens! Your shitcoin philosopher is back.

Today we're diving deep into some crucial shit that'll help you understand why sometimes your trades fuck you harder than your wife's boyfriend during market dumps. 


This is a guide for all those newcomers and newbies that never put in the effort to understand how DEXs work.

  

We're talking Liquidity Pools and that mysterious thing called ""slippage"" that keeps cockblocking your trades.

### WTF Are Liquidity Pools?

You know how on Binance or Coinbase, you can just buy and sell whenever you want and there’s no stuff like slippage? That's because they use the traditional order book system - buyers and sellers meeting up like on Tinder, but for trades.

  

But in the wild west of DEXs (Raydium, Uniswap, etc.), we don't have that luxury. Instead, we've got these things called Liquidity Pools. 

Think of them as two giant buckets of tokens that are permanently married to each other. One bucket might have SOL, the other USDT, and they're managed by something called an AMM (Automated Market Maker) - basically a robot that does math to decide prices.

  

(If you are interested in learning more about AMM and how it works, lemme know and I will write a special guide around it!)

### How These Bad Boys Work

Let me break it down with a simple example that even your drunk ass can understand:

  

Let's say we create a new LP (Liquidity Pool) for SOL-USDT:

  

- Bucket 1: 10 SOL 
- Bucket 2: 1000 USDT 
- Current price: 1 SOL = 100 USDT 
  

Here's the magic formula these pools use:

  

Pool Value = Token1 × Token2 = K (constant)

  

In our example: 10 × 1000 = 10,000 (This K will always stay the same no matter what)

### Why Should You Give a Shit?

Because this system is completely different from centralized exchanges, and if you don't understand it, you're basically playing poker blindfolded.

  

On Binance, when you buy 1 SOL for 100 USDT, that's exactly what you get. Simple as that.

  

But in our degen world of DEXs? Oh boy, it gets spicy. The more you try to buy or sell relative to the pool size, the worse price you get. This is where our old friend ""slippage"" comes in.

### Slippage: The Silent Gains Killer

Remember our pool with 10 SOL and 1000 USDT? Let's see why slippage happens and why it makes you pay more than you expect.

#### The ""Expected"" Price vs Reality

Let's say you want to buy 2 SOL:

  

Current price shows 1 SOL = 100 USDT.

  

So you expect to pay 200 USDT for 2 SOL.

  

But that's not how this shit works.

#### Why You Pay More

The pool has to keep its balance (that magic K number). Here's what happens step by step:

  

1. Starting Pool: 
  

- 10 SOL & 1000 USDT 
- K = 10 × 1000 = 10,000 
  

2. You want 2 SOL, so after your trade: 
  

- SOL in pool will be: 8 SOL (10 - 2) 
- USDT needs to make: K = 10,000 
- So: 8 × New_USDT = 10,000 
- New_USDT = 10,000 / 8 
- New_USDT = 1250 
- You need to put in: 1250 - 1000 = 250 USDT to balance out the LP 
  

3. The Reality Check: 
  

- Expected to pay: 200 USDT 
- Actually paying: 250 USDT 
- That's 25% more than you expected = 25% slippage 

#### Why This Happens: The Pool Size Effect

Think of it like this:

  

- Small trade in big pool = small price impact 
- Big trade in small pool = bend over, here comes the slippage 
  

Scenarios in pool with 10 SOL liquidity:

  

Scenario 1: You buying 0.1 SOL: 
  

- Barely moves the pool 
- Maybe 1-2% slippage 
- You're gucci 
  

Scenario 2: You buying 2 SOL (20% of the pool): 
  

- Massively disrupts the balance 
- 25% slippage 
- You're getting rekt 
  

Scenario 3: Some whale buying 5 SOL (50% of the pool): 
  

- Catastrophically fucks the balance 
- Could face 80%+ slippage 
- Straight up not having a good time 

#### The Degen's Solution

Here's how to not get completely rekt by slippage:

  

Check Pool Size: 
  

- Pool has 10,000 SOL? You can ape in 50 SOL 
- Pool has 100 SOL? Do NOT put 50 SOL there 
  

The Rule of 2%: 
  

- Try to keep your trades under 2% of the pool size 
- In a pool with 10,000 SOL, your highest trade should not exceed 200 SOL 
- In a pool with 10 SOL, your highest trade should not exceed 0.2 SOL 
- Want to buy more? Split it up 
- Example: Instead of one 2 SOL buy, do four 0.5 SOL buys 
  

Slippage Settings: 
  

- Normal coins (big pools): 1-3% slippage 
- Shitcoins (small pools): 5-15% slippage 
- Ultra degen plays: Sometimes even 25%+ (but don't be stupid) 
  

### The Degen's Pro Tips

####For Buying: 
  

- If you are buying with $1000+, look for pools with at least $50K liquidity 
- If you are buying with $100+, look for pools with at least $5k liquidity 
- Split your buys into 3-4 smaller transactions 
- Set slippage based on pool size (bigger pool = lower slippage needed) 
  

####For Selling: 
  

- Use trailing stop loss to sell in chunks 
- If you've got a big bag, sell when volume is high 

### Real-World Example: The $WIF Massacre

Remember when $WIF first launched? Some whale tried to dump 100K worth in one transaction. The slippage was so bad they got less than 60K worth of SOL. Meanwhile, the chads who sold in smaller chunks got much better prices.

### Wrapping It Up

Understanding Liquidity Pools and slippage isn't just some galaxy brain shit - it's essential for not getting completely rekt in the shitcoin shitfest. Use this knowledge wisely, and maybe you'll be the one dumping on others instead of becoming exit liquidity.

  

Stay frosty, and may your slippage be low and your gains be high!

Reddit,solana,"Relatively new to Crypto in general, been scalping with leverage on BTC on smaller amounts. ",2024-10-24 00:33:37,"So have just been scalping and doing small daily short/long scalps, have been doing research, I can say I'm probably about even from what I've gained and lost. I'm in Ireland so Crypto in general over here is still kinda seen as the equivalent of gambling in a sense. 

In saying that we have a a government agency called CAB (Criminal Assets Beaure) so they can seize the proceeds of crime if you can't prove how you earned the money or assets so the state can seize it on that basis. But there was a court case recently where this dude was growing weed and stuff and he was buying BTC and cold storing it and the storage was seized in the end but the passkeys were lost. 

So the Irish government have the equivalent of like 500 million euro worth of coin but cannot access it. 

How many other countries hold crypto worth millions but have no way to access it? And if a state can hold crypto and not be able to access it, does that mean they can claim a value on it to be used to borrow? ",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026
Reddit,solana,Solana Wallet with portfolio and Watchlist,2024-10-24 09:12:07,"Hey,

I’m building a new Solana wallet (potentially cross-chain) which aims to combine a lot of the Solana services into one app and just wanted to ask for ur traders opinion 😝. 

So the app is gonna be a self custody wallet build for mobile, which has all the basic functionality like Phantom but brings in some new cool things. 

Firstly, people will be able to to create a watchlist, just like you can in the coin market cap app or birdeye and when you click on the the tokens you can immediately trade with very fast tx speed on that token info page which contains a graph, token info and your transaction history with that token. 

Which brings me to my next unique feature, showing PnL. The user will have a Portfolio page where you can see all of your assets and total balance. This will show your PnL for each token and your total balance over time. 

There will also be a search icon on every screen where you can search for tokens and add them your watchlist with one click and immediately trade. 

Would you guys give this a try? And do you think this would be a cool app people would use?

Thanksss ❤️",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,ethereum,"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared Vision",2024-10-26 11:41:15,"I’ve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. On the surface, they may seem like separate communities—one focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology—but at their core, they’re both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society.

Both UBI and Ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. They’re about creating a world where we don’t have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we’re looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. It’s about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society.

Money, when you think about it, is political. Every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. In a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper—into the structures that uphold our shared reality.

For those interested in diving further into this vision, here’s a bit of inspiration from popular culture:

- **Arrival** – A film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens.
- **Outlander** – A story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today.
- **Mad Men** – A look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception.
- **Devs** – A glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself.

These themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. Basic Income and Ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future.

What do you think? Are we ready to see that /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum might actually be part of the same community, working toward the same future?",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,ethereum,I can't understand L2 networks no matter what,2024-10-21 12:27:28,"So my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular L2 right and if I make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? 


If say bob sends 1 eth to Alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? 


And how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn?


please help, I can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are L2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues.



---




Edit: It finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/DepartedQuantity for helping me out.


So here's my understanding:

Till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the L1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the L1 as a single transaction with some proofs. And some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. 


But the thing is that the L2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. Connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. And all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network    are transactions details(or whatever) in L2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered.


And not L1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,ethereum, Ethereum builder centralization and your contribution,2024-10-18 22:13:25,"In recent weeks, more than 90% of Ethereum blocks have been built by just two block builders: beaverbuild.org and titanbuilder.xyz. This trend is growing, and it’s likely these two will dominate nearly all block production soon, profiting massively from users transactions MEV. [https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d](https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d)

The driving force behind this centralization is XOF (private orderflow), as explained by Toni Wahrstätter on X: [https://x.com/nero\_eth/status/1846786871998759141](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1846786871998759141)

So, where does this private orderflow originate?

For [titanbuilder.xyz](http://titanbuilder.xyz), it partly comes from BananaGunBot (https://x.com/BananaGunBot), as seen in blocks like this one: [https://etherscan.io/block/20959121](https://etherscan.io/block/20959121)

For [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org), it comes from platforms like [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (https://cow.fi/mev-blocker). Their FAQ states they submit to all major builders:

>MEV Blocker submits to all major block builders, including Builder0x69, f1b, Flashbots, rsync builder, Titan Builder, Gambit Labs, and Beaver Build.

But there is a catch: who created MEV Blocker? according to their FAQ:

>MEV Blocker is jointly formulated and maintained by CoW Protocol, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is open to all searchers and block builders.

The last part seems questionable. With control over the order flow, who would rationally share most profitable or important transactions with competitors?

It gets worse: a bot operated by beaverbuild uses the same calldata as the notorious jaredfromsubway MEV bot (https://x.com/MevRefund/status/1835666845547815067), suggesting beaverbuild likely operates the jared bot. jaredfromsubway is known for sandwiching pretty much everything and everyone (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f2f10d1c40777ae1da742455c65828ff36df387).

So, what’s my point? Avoid trading shitcoins, especially with BananaGun. And don’t use [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (rather make sure you have set your slippage tolerance correctly), which appears to be little more than a hypocritical frontend for beaverbuild.

Reddit,ethereum,Lido's Simple DVT Module Surpasses Expectations—A Deeper Look at Distributed Validator Technology's Future in Ethereum Staking,2024-10-18 11:50:36,"I’ve been keeping an eye on the recent developments with Lido’s Simple DVT module, and the numbers are impressive. Just recently, the module hit 2,250 validators and over 72,000 ETH staked, surpassing its initial 0.5% share limit, as noted by u/LidoFinance. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) now powers around 0.75% of the entire Lido protocol. What’s even more interesting is how these DVT clusters are outperforming 8 out of the top 10 staking entities, according to u/ratedw3b.

This got me thinking: What does this mean for the future of Ethereum staking? 🤔

For one, the decentralization of staking is clearly on the rise. DVT allows for a more robust and fault-tolerant staking infrastructure, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure. Projects like SSV Network and Obol Collective are really pushing the envelope here, making Ethereum staking more accessible and secure for both solo and community stakers. It’s awesome to see over 140 new solo and community stakers becoming node operators via DVT—this is a huge step toward decentralization.

But it also raises a bigger question: Could DVT be the key to breaking the dominance of large staking pools and making Ethereum more decentralized at the protocol level? 🤔

SSV Network, in particular, has been at the forefront of this movement. By enabling secure and distributed validator setups, they are changing the game for both small-scale stakers and large operators. I can’t help but wonder how this will impact the wider Ethereum ecosystem, especially as staking becomes more fragmented and democratized.

Would love to hear what you all think—are we on the verge of a decentralization revolution in Ethereum staking, or is it too early to tell? ",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,ethereum,Domain Registrar Based on Smart Contracts,2024-10-17 17:05:22,"# Project Concept

We propose creating a new type of domain registrar that uses smart contracts instead of traditional accounts to determine domain management rights.

# How It Works

1. When transferring a domain to this registrar, functions in the smart contract are called to add the new domain.
2. The address of the smart contract that has the rights to sign changes related to this domain is specified.

# Advantages

1. **Decentralized Management:** Domains do not depend on an individual's email.
2. **Flexible Management:** Ability to use multi-signature or DAO voting for decisions on DNS record changes.
3. **Security:** Use of cryptographic protection methods instead of passwords.
4. **Transparency:** All changes are recorded on the blockchain.

# Technical Implementation

1. **Integration with Existing DNS:** The service functions as a regular centralized registrar, fully compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure.
2. **Support for Popular Domains:** Ability to transfer and manage top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.).
3. **Auto-Renewal:** The system automatically renews domain registration by deducting funds from the smart contract.
4. **Open Balance Top-Up:** Any user can top up the contract balance for a specific domain without the need for authorization.

# Potential Applications

* For DAO projects
* For collaborative business projects
* For personal use (using a wallet instead of email for ownership confirmation)

# Questions for the Community

1. If such a project were implemented and announced by one of the top 10 existing domain registrars, would you use it for your new project?
2. Would you consider using this service for your personal domains?
3. What additional features would you like to see in such a service?
4. How do you assess the potential of this technology for managing digital assets in the future?",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

As a reminder the start of the transition to proof of stake started back in December 2020. The staking chain was launched then to run in parallel with the proof of work chain. Staking was then enabled, but withdrawals from staking were not. The proof of work chain and the proof of stake merged in September 2022, almost two years after the initial phase. Finaly unstaking was enabled in March 2023, when everyone who had staked on the PoS chain could unstake if they wish so.

How is staking Ethereum going these days? After everything was finished and time has passed. Are more users unstaking or maybe staking now? It’s been a year since the unstaking is live so let’s check it out.

Reddit,ethereum,Constellation is Live! Help scale Rocket Pool and support decentralized node operators!,2024-10-16 00:53:10,"Hi r/ethereum, I’m one of the co-founders of NodeSet, the developer of [Constellation](https://nodeset.medium.com/project-hyperdrive-4819f22391dc), a “Layer 2” staking protocol built on top of Rocket Pool! 

The main innovations of Constellation are xrETH, a liquid ETH staking token with ZERO fees on Ethereum staking rewards (including MEV), and xRPL, a liquid staking token for RPL. Gravita is launching the first public Constellation deployment on mainnet today, and [minting these tokens is now available via the Gravita website!](https://app.gravitaprotocol.com/constellation/xreth)

Once minted, the Constellation contracts non-custodially distribute the assets among NodeSet’s hundreds of decentralized operators, funding the operator bond (currently 8 ETH + 2.4 ETH or RPL) and unlocking their ability to deploy RP validators at scale.

We’ve spent the last 18+ months building both a robust (250+) and vetted cohort of independent node operators, including solo stakers, Rocket Pool operators, and small staking businesses. NodeSet’s mission is to connect the long-tail of decentralized operators that make Ethereum the most credibly neutral settlement layer in the world to compute opportunities across the ecosystem. Constellation, our first major project, supports the protocol that got us started on our journey as a company, Rocket Pool. Over the last year, RP has faced scaling challenges due to its bonding requirements, which has resulted in contraction of the protocol. Constellation was designed to alleviate those challenges while improving Rocket Pool’s underlying asset distribution. With nearly 40,000 ETH sitting in the rETH deposit pool, it’s time to unleash Constellation and grow Ethereum’s most decentralized liquid staking protocol! 

For those interested in diving deeper into the technology, please [take a look at the Constellation documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation). There’s a lot of work remaining, but we will be adding more information over the coming weeks, and [the GPLv3 code is available on our GitHub](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation), of course. On the security side, we recently [concluded three audits from some of the best in the business](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation/tree/main/audits) like Chainsafe and Sigma Prime, and [our bug bounty program details are located in the documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation/security-information).

Reddit,ethereum,Upsides and Downsides of Lowering Ethereum's Solo Staking Requirement?,2024-10-15 12:29:21,"The current solo staking system is for rich people. Most of us here dont have 32 ETH. Right now 32 ETH is $82 700 - only those with deep pockets can become validators because thats not even life savings for the average person. This of course excludes many average investors from helping secure the network directly

Vitalik posted yesterday in his blog the idea of dropping the staking requirement - He said as low as 1 ETH

Quoting:

>Ideally, we want to preserve economic finality, while simultaneously improving on the status quo in two areas:

>1 Finalize blocks in one slot (ideally, keep or even reduce the current length of 12s), instead of 15 min

>2 Allow validators to stake with 1 ETH (down from 32 ETH)

As someone who wishes to become a validator I think this is good and bad. Making staking accessible to more people would pump participation and decentralization - But is this ideal???

The first downside is the impact on yields - With more validators joining rewards would decrease by a lot - making solo staking less profitable. This would also dilute the incentives for maintaining nodes - which could result in less security if validators lose interest because of the lower returns. On the flip side decentralization would increase with more people participating - not just whales. There would be less reliance on staking pools - Lido for example

More participants means a more resilient network but this is at the cost of validator quality and security

The staking requirement should drop a little so it gives smaller investors a chance - not just the rich - but it should be something higher like 10 ETH. This way the network wouldnt be trading validator rewards for participation and decentralization and security would be maintained and the yields wouldnt be so low",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,ethereum,Can layer 2 scalability really undermine Ethereum’s value?,2024-10-12 08:15:40,"Lately, I’ve been seeing more and more posts, mostly on X, explaining why, in their opinion, it’s now certain that the price of ETH can only go down. 

Their argument is that Ethereum’s scalability, based on L2, leads to a growing reduction in users who rely on L1, and that the fees paid by L2s to L1 are extremely low (almost free), which translates into lower revenues for L1. So if the L2s roadmap plays out, it would basically result in a divergence between Ethereum L1 utility (increasing by number of users on L2s settling on Ethereum) and ETH price (decreasing by lower fees geenrated for L1).

Another argument that’s often heard is that the most successful L2s in the medium/long term will completely detach from Ethereum, becoming independent L1s and taking their user base with them.

Regarding this last argument, I find it unlikely since the value of Ethereum lies precisely in its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance, and that’s not something L2s can easily achieve overnight. So, unless an L2 wants to become a centralized L1 like others, it wouldn’t make sense to detach from Ethereum.

As for the first argument, the issue of fees paid by L2s to settle transactions on L1 is definitely relevant. Currently, they are very low, but that doesn’t mean it can’t change in the future. After all, Ethereum’s main value is to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant layer for settling transactions. Being the only chain with these characteristics, aside from perhaps Bitcoin, Ethereum L1 should charge appropriate fees to L2s for settlement.

summary ↓

an exploration of the commons scale goods that make Ethereum (network, asset, media), what underpins their integrity, and how [u/ProtocolGuild](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild) can help with that

*Thanks to* [*Barnabé*](https://x.com/barnabemonnot)*,* [*John*](https://x.com/jszcz_)*,* [*Josh*](https://x.com/TBSocialist)*,* [*Paul*](https://x.com/post_polar_)*, and* [*Tim*](https://x.com/TimBeiko) *for review.*

Ethereum is a commons like the natural + digital ones that precede it: fisheries, forests, the internet, Linux, etc. Commons are productive systems which create resources for collective benefit

https://preview.redd.it/fn8akvk03ytd1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0513922a6950641fdbb2763d2c5eeb9c9b51a31

Ethereum's three shared resources: network, asset, media

their confluence produces what we call Ethereum mainnet: they are deeply interdependent here, but altered forms make the edges of the broader commons

these resources are produced through protocols: technical, legal, economic, social, political

complete ownership of each resource is not desirable, as it destroys their integrity. therefore, actors engage in production for influence extraction

https://preview.redd.it/4k9pd6hf3ytd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba7f5b53ba8a1e0c722c38529fab0fc78bf35936

Protocol Guild gives us a transparent, legible, sustainable and accountable funding allocation mechanism for software media production. there are 5 main threads which make it unique:

1. narrow mandate
2. broad self-curation
3. members are individuals
4. 4yr onchain vesting contract
5. designed with time in mind

it holistically funds stewardship of the entire watershed - not rivers in isolation

Commons have had a rough go under capitalism - but there is hope in long-lived natural precedents: irrigation, fisheries, farming.

Reddit,ethereum,What is the ethereum platform (in the context of purchasing goods on the internet) ,2024-10-10 18:26:32,"Hey guys, total newbie (although I am technically invested in ethereum lol) and I want to buy something on the internet that requires me to pay in ethereum, more specifically, from the “ethereum platform” itself. What does this mean? I paid via ethereum from
My coinbase wallet and that was not sufficient. 

“Hello Sir, Ethereum is the main network for ETH and is independent of any platform. You should be able to pay from any wallet but choose the Network -> Ethereum. This means that the transaction will appear in ETH blockchain here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x466D0713Fb2aE827751402f68f81BA2F7d5Ec5F0”

These were the instructions, but I’m unclear as to how that’s not the same as me paying via ethereum on the coinbase app. Do I got to this website to make the transaction? He said I could pay from any wallet…

Anyways if anyone is willing to explain this to me like I’m 5 so I don’t lose more money, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! ",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

But when I look it up on [Zapper.xyz](http://zapper.xyz/), I can see some of its interactions. It seems like the owner is using some kind of proxy contract or relayer to mask their transaction history.

The ability to hide transactions from Etherscan like this is a game-changer, and I’m really curious about how it’s done. Does anyone have insights on how to replicate this setup or what tools they might be using?",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis

Reddit,bitcoin,We are still so early,2024-10-26 23:27:01,"- Just talked to one of my friends about BTC, he is working as a stock analyst at a bank.(mid 20s)
- He literally said gold is a better choice and has finite supply but BTC does not, because there is limited amount of gold on Earth, but you can “just click two and now you have a bitcoin”. 
- I tried to ask questions why he assumes both as a fact, no explanation just this is it. (if anyone knows how to get a BTC by clicking twice please let me know)

Some other “good points”
- BTC is backed by nothing
- BTC can go zero anytime
- BTC is worth nothing until you can use it to pay at grocery stores

It’s kinda difficult to understand how somebody can work in a position without any critical thinking and being this closed minded. I still assume I might be wrong and I would like to hear his points, but all the stuff he said is just like classic mainstream media words, shocking. 🫠",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

From whatever I could gather online so far, a private electrum server is needed for an electrum wallet to connect privately because it cannot connect directly to bitcoin core.

From sparrow's documentation it looks like it can connect to both - a private bitcoin core as well as a private electrum server.

I do not intend to use electrum wallet. I intend to use sparrow wallet.

I understand that a private electrum server sits between sparrow wallet and bitcoin core. But I do not understand how this is more secure or helpful than sparrow wallet connecting directly to a private bitcoin core. And why is it listed as the recommended choice for Expert stage.

Reddit,bitcoin,"Have coin on an exchange, and now my own full node, now what? ",2024-10-27 04:18:02,"\[FYI I already know all the basic warnings about PMs and dont give out your address, etc, etc\]

I bought my first BTC a couple months ago on Swan... and then later learned about running your own node and KYC.  It's still sitting on their exchange and I need to move it off to either my new hardware wallet, or a software wallet like Sparrow or Electrum.

I'm looking to understand the best practice basics now that I have my own full node running. I haven't found much info on this, so would I first move off Swan directly to a new wallet sitting on my node itself (mynodebtc), and then to my own offline software or hardware wallet? Or do I just connect Sparrow directly to my own node, generate a receiving address in Sparrow, and then fire away sending to it from Swan?

Ideally I would prefer non-KYC, as anyone would, just to minimize future govt control and havoc (they cant control as easy if they don't know you have it). I'm already cooked with KYC, so where it goes it will forever be a KYC only wallet. It's probably dumb to sell it and have to figure out the taxes on a \~$800 profit just to start over and move to non-KYC. So maybe it's ok to have a little KYC coin? But at the same time in the future I would probably keep a separate wallet for non-KYC and move toward.

Lastly, what's the best ""order of process"" to use my node properly for non-KYC in the future using P2P?  For the P2P receiving address, would I point the sender to a wallet that is ONLY connected through my own node? or does it need to be sent to a wallet actually sitting on the node itself first, then to a sparrow wallet connected to my node?",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,bitcoin,Convinced a friend! (& First lightning use) Some Reflections.,2024-10-26 08:06:53,"I had an interesting experience yesterday, I’m in the process of convincing a friend that crypto has practical uses, and yesterday he set up coinbase, went through KYC and bought some. He also set up a reoccurring buy, just small amounts but at least he has his foot in the door.

As he is a bartender, for his parents bar, I’m trying to get them to accept BTC and use lightning as a method of payment. So first step was showing how to send “value” to someone using a simple method, I used Wallet of Satoshi as its as simple as it gets and has a Point of Sale function too.  
First through I needed to send some btc to my own Wallet of Satoshi app, but coinbase has a 48 hour waiting period to send to a new (white listed) address. Then I realised, I am also my own bank! I have a ledger hardware wallet, so used that with my ledger live app on my iPad, my nano x and sent it within minutes!
Last night I went to the bar, and he’d set up his WoS app, using an email address so as to be able to reuse his wallet on other devices, and it was just so quick and easy to ping him some money! Overall a great learning experience for us both!

This shows the benefits of being your own bank, but also it has downsides. I sold a Motorhome (RV, camping car) last week, and the lady buying it had to jump through so many hoops in order to get her own money. Then up to 3 days to receive it in my account(weekends in France)! She went to the bank branch in the end on Monday and kicked up a stink, I received the money later that day, but had to delay all her plans due to this. With crypto I’d have had it straight away! But also, there are scammers that could also take advantage of this. Some people need protection and are not responsible enough for self custody of their money. A scammer could take a person’s whole life in a matter of minutes. Banks are missing a trick not already acting as custodial of peoples wealth. Governments should enforce that bank have this as a service maybe? For people who want it, they should have it. Coinbase does obviously, but no guarantees.",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,bitcoin,is quantum computing a threat to bitcoin?,2024-10-27 11:56:48,"Quantum computing is advancing at a rapid pace. Major breakthroughs have been achieved in recent months, and progress is accelerating faster than predicted. Chinese researchers have already managed to break encryption. What are your thoughts on this? Am I the only one who sees a genuine threat emerging for Bitcoin and all other blockchains?

I’ve looked into this, and it appears it would take Bitcoin 1-2 years to fork to a quantum-resistant blockchain.

I recently came across Cellframe, a blockchain that has been developing a quantum-resistant platform for the past seven years. They have used C programming, which is much more complex, and have implemented four layers of quantum security. If quantum computers somehow manage to breach one layer, they still have three more to overcome. Additionally, Cellframe can continuously improve its security without needing to fork.

I noticed that their two-way bridge to their blockchain went live and into beta this week. Could this become a vital and resilient blockchain for the future? If other blockchains become vulnerable in the coming years, one would almost expect people to seek refuge in the Cellframe blockchain.

Reddit,bitcoin,How can I donate my self-custodied Bitcoin after death while keeping access during my lifetime?,2024-10-25 18:01:47,"I'm looking for a way to donate the rest of my Bitcoin from my self-custodied wallet to some active Bitcoin addresses after my death (let's say 100 years from now or 50 years after inactivity), while still being able to use it freely during my lifetime. I don't want to lock the funds with time-locked transactions or rely on any third-party services. Is there a native Bitcoin solution for this, or do I need to look into it as an enhancement request?

If you are a Bitcoin developer, please consider a solution if one hasn't been implemented yet, and your beloved future Bitcoin team will receive my Bitcoin without any questions asked! Your successor Bitcoin team can show this post as proof that you received my Bitcoin as a donation for free because of what you did in the past!!

I am also considering being cryopreserved if I reach a certain age while being alive, so maybe I can meet [Hal Finney when he wakes up in the future](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2eumew/hal_finney_being_cryopreserved_now/). But the truth is, I might die suddenly for a stupid reason, without any part of me being able to survive to be frozen in the first place! This is why I want to be able to transfer my Bitcoin in future after a sudden death,  otherwise, freezing my  body after a certain age or death seems like a perfect use case for holding Bitcoin!

For now the only solution I can think of is to let my Bitcoin be lost with me, which doesn't seem like a bad idea because it could boost Bitcoin's value! It’s like giving my Bitcoin to all Bitcoiners rather than just a few. Still, the idea of donating to organizations like Bitcoin developers or human rights groups feels worth exploring. What do you think?

FYI, I don’t have children or anyone else whom I can or want to trust. I prefer to live trustlessly, free, and without any commitments in my lifetime, but I would like to commit to doing something after my death. I hope that makes sense!

  
**Update:** I found a workaround that meets my needs. I'm sharing it here for anyone who believes in ""Not your keys, not your coins.""

  
**Solution:** I will create 9 wallets beside my main wallet using the same 24-word seed phrase,  Main wallet with no passphrase and other 9 wallets with a simple unique numeric passphrase. This way, all wallets share the same 24-word seed but have an additional identifier, making them easy to manage and access through a single hardware wallet.

Next, I plan to divide my Bitcoin into 10 equal portions and send each portion to one of these wallets. I’ll use the main wallet during my lifetime, and I set a time-locked transaction for the next 100 years to transfer the Bitcoin at other 9 wallets to designated people or organizations. This setup allows me to use my main wallet normally, and if I ever need more funds, I can cancel a time-locked transaction from one of the other 9 wallets and transfer the balance back to my main wallet by overwriting the transaction fee with a higher amount in the future. This workaround also should help me truly HODL the other wallets for a much longer time. If I accumulate more Bitcoin in my main wallet, I can always transfer the extra to a new wallet. The key point is that all of these wallets use the same 24-word seed, making the setup very convenient.

The challenging part is determining recipient addresses, as each recipient must maintain access to their wallet for the next 100 years!! I can check that time to time as much as I am alive but  If they lose access after my life, it’s their fault for losing their  Bitcoin, and it’s no longer my concern because I’ll be long gone and unaffected!!

Hopefully, Bitcoin developers will come up with a better solution by then. Until that happens, my workaround should do the job, and I’m okay with potentially losing my main wallet in the event of sudden death. What a Bitcoiner life!",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,bitcoin,HODL the Line,2024-10-26 19:23:21,"To the steadfast believers: now is the time to witness the truth unfold. We are entering a monumental phase, backed by the mathematics and principles of sound money that Bitcoin represents.

**Math on Our Side**

Over 90% of Bitcoin holders are in profit, signaling the early stages of a major upward trend. The recent halving reduced Bitcoin’s supply while demand from institutional giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and even entire nation-states continues to soar, setting the stage for a price explosion. They calculate what we've always known: Bitcoin is the future.

**Bitcoin: Store of Value and Medium of Exchange**

Unlike gold, which is hard to spend, or fiat, which loses value, Bitcoin bridges both worlds. It stores wealth securely and can be easily transacted across borders. The evolution of the Lightning Network and Layer 2 solutions strengthens Bitcoin’s potential as the backbone of a decentralized financial system, blending value storage and fluid exchange.

**The Double-Edged Sword**

As Bitcoin’s price rises, the temptation to sell will grow. But wealth isn’t the reason to HODL. You hold because Bitcoin offers financial sovereignty, free from inflation and reckless policies. Selling may offer short-term gains, but Bitcoin’s power lies in its incorruptible nature.

**Integration, Not Opposition**

Instead of seeing fiat and Bitcoin as enemies, we can move to integrating the centralized inflationary and decentralized deflationary systems to potentially create a more dynamic, free, and balanced economy. Blockchain technology will become standardized for the traditional monetary system as well. This transition is not immediate but clearly paves the way forward to a more just financial future.

**The Time to Hold is Now**

This is about more than price. Bitcoin represents a future where currency is governed only by the pirnciples of math and freedom. As mass adoption bends the economy, HODLing will secure your place in a decentralized world. Spread awareness, engage with the system, and encourage others to learn about Bitcoin’s potential.

We’re not just holding bitcoin, we’re holding the future.

Stay strong. **HODL in confidence.**",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,bitcoin,"Using Bitcoin To Create An ""Educational Trust"" - Possible?",2024-10-25 19:22:43,"Happy Friday!  I am trying to understand more about how crypto currencies, exchanges, wallets work.  Specifically, I’m trying to figure out if it’s possible to use crypto to essentially create an “educational trust” of sorts.

My girlfriend wants to come to the US to study for a second Bachelor degree, but doesn’t have the required savings.  I’m willing to pay for the education for obvious reasons, but the US Government requires her to have a full year’s worth of tuition to qualify for a student visa.  The money must be in an account in her name.

While it isn’t that I don’t trust her, there’s trust and then there’s stupid trust.  There is a world of difference between my giving $10k to a university for her tuition and me giving her $40k with no strings attached.  Just so much difference.

However, it seems that USCIS will accept Bitcoin assets as proof of financial capability.  And it has been suggested to me by a friend that I might be able to use a crypto exchange or wallet to create an account in her name that I effectively control by holding the keys.  Or at least holding one of the keys.  I guess there are dual key systems?

In order to work, it would need to have the following qualities:

1.      Have some kind of display or ideally a “statement” (like a bank statement) showing how much is in the account.

2.      Probably the current value of the Bitcoin.

3.      Show her name as the owner of the account.

4.      Have a key that I hold that would prevent her from just transferring to another account.

5.      Allow accounts to be created by Russians.

 

If there’s a way to accomplish this awesome, I would appreciate any help. ",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,bitcoin,One year ago..,2024-10-25 02:08:33,"One year ago I made a post on r/investing titled ""How will the US pay back its debts which are becoming more expensive to own?"". The overwhelming response? Inflate the debt away.

I used to be a traditional boglehead where I would just 100% VOO and chill. However, after researching about bitcoin and its nature being digital hard money it became obvious to me given the current trend of hyperinflation and continuous government spending.

I believe it is in the self interest of every central bank and every company to have bitcoin on their balance sheet. It's just fair accounting.

The value of US treasuries, which were once thought of as THE safe haven asset, have been killed by inflation. After Russia invaded Ukraine and got their assets filled with US treasuries frozen, sirens across all the central banks around the world were fired. The message? You don't own anything.

BRICS? What a joke. Does anyone realistically think that Russia trusts China? Or any of the countries? Sure they have a shared enemy. Maybe they share some aspects of ideology. But behind closed doors, none of them realistically trust each other to back a shared currency.

The solution is bitcoin. The value? An immutable distributed ledger that is scarce, digital, and #1 adopted. The world needs bitcoin.

People will slowly realize that the only reason the illusion of price stability exists is because the fed artificially sets it as such while the real value of your salary and the money in your savings are getting demolished. The number 1 export of the US is inflation. Sure, for a few economic cycles countries might just deal with it. But sooner or later they will realize that the wealth disparity between the asset owning rich and the cash earning middle and poor will drastically widen.

Do I think that bitcoin will be widely adopted as a currency? Maybe, probably not.
Do I think bitcoin will be a key strategic asset in every major central bank's and companies' balance sheets? Yes.

Bitcoin is inevitable.

My prediction is this thing will take off, but it will be painfully slow. Stats show most people are not good with money and don’t have much to invest. Add the scandals like SBF and Silk Road, and people just get scared off. It will take years of ‘proof’ that it is a solid investment for the naysayers. Many people still don’t trust stocks, and how long has that been around and showing its worth?

The guide goes beyond the basics by giving practical tips, like using DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) to buy Bitcoin steadily, no matter the price swings. It’s been super helpful here in LATAM, but I wonder—would people in other parts of the world care about the same things?

What’s interesting is how scalable it is. With just a bit of funding, the Spanish version has reached a ton of people, even in low-income areas.

Instead, focusing on practical, straightforward info works much better.

I actually used all this experience to create a guide, which even got support from Bitfinex. The outcome was pretty cool: over 12,000 people across LATAM got access to the info, and from those who downloaded it and answered the survey, 93% gave positive feedback.

It showed me that there's a real, practical way to teach Bitcoin to more people, regardless of their background.

Reddit,bitcoin,Most people won't care even if Bitcoin hits $1 million,2024-10-24 03:23:29,"I was having a thought experiment and was curious on what other opinions you guys had: what will our society look like when Bitcoin is priced at one million USD? 

Sure it would be headlining financial news, but by that time, people will be desensitized every time it hits $100k, $500k, so on.

The level of adoption based on UX and education will be more relevant to the ordinary person than its price per se, which I hope will grow exponentially in the decades to come.

For me, I would still have significantly more to go to become a millionaire but it would still help with the down payment for my first home, or pay off a mortgage if it miraculously got approved by that time.

Reflecting back on my own past (and my current non-bitcoiner friends), news about Bitcoin had zero relevance to me at every single bull run. Every time I said things like “I missed the chance”, or “it has no real application to me right now” and continue to see no reason to explore alternatives to fiat currency. The fiat mindset is literally ingrained in our brains from such a young age - that will slowly start to change as bitcoin education gains traction. So we will probably see true mass adoption (although $1 million price tag might arrive sooner) take generations from now, i.e., 15-30 years. Why I say 15 years is because 2009 babies will be 30 years old by then and covid babies 19 years old, assuming a larger generational shift in monetary mindset.

* The next big bull run in Bitcoin is underway, with targets between $180k-$300k once new all-time highs are achieved.
* Despite relatively high ""Greed"" levels, historical analogies suggest Bitcoin can rally significantly, similar to the 429% rally from September 2020.
* Technical indicators show Bitcoin has plenty of upside potential, with weekly and daily RSI levels indicating room for further growth.
* Short-term resistance may occur around $72k-$74k, but beyond that, Bitcoin has a clear path for a strong bullish advance.

As I have been anticipating in [**recent articles**](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720614-bitcoin-bullish-consolidation-almost-complete#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), the next big bull run in Bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) is now in progress.

Join us for the live AMA on October 25th, and let’s chat about ETH Restaking. In the meantime, **ask us questions in advance**, I'll try to get through as many as I can.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,This is the bullrun and your favorite projects are cooked,2024-10-26 09:24:18,"The s&p500 is breaking ATHs, BTC hit a new ath this year and is consolidating right bellow waiting to make its move passed it again.

You're all in denial about alt season repeating like in former cycles. I see it everyday with people buying up shitcoins and everyone in those ""communities"" claiming they're all going to go 4x their previous ATH ""once the bullbrun starts.""

News flash. This is the bullrun. Previously, people would take BTC profits and pump up larger cap alts, take those profits and go to small caps and finally micro caps. More people are holding onto their BTC. Look at the charts, theres far fewer flash crashes. All metrics suggest this including BTC in cold storage and more inactive wallets than ever. This BTC progression in previous cycles saw the alt coin market going nuts. At this point, You could do a 4x on any random binance pair. The fomo was crazy. There's none of that now. Just bleeding alts to BTC.

Furthermore, people are skipping out on the larger cap speculation for the meme coin defi market. Raydium is seeing all the volume that traditionally went to CEX listed alts.

""But meme coins are stupid and serve no purpose, I only buy ""serious"" projects.

News flash. The alt coin you've been holding for 5 years is just as useless as ElonBadgerCoq on trader Joe's. It's done nothing. The team has accomplished nothing. You know this and still try to justify your investment so you can separate yourself from the degen gamblers buying cat tokens on some DEX. I don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. Its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale.

Yes, some projects will pump in the next year. Yes, some projects are genuinely good with great developers making amazing tech. But most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to ATHs. Price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. There's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper. No major publicly sold company cares about how decentralized something is.

Downvote me all you want. I know you really care about whatever ETH killer youve been stacking and holding. Some of you will get lucky and I hope you do. But for most, its not happening.

The reason why meme coins are so popular is because it's the streamlined, super fast paced version of the entire crypto market. It's the final format. A launch, a bunch of hype, the coin bleeds out, some people make some money, most lose. The coin drops close to 0 with all the bag holders claiming it will return to where it was.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Just some musings from a random internet stranger regarding the numerous posts we’re starting to see increase, regarding the Bull.  Mainly with regard to how we’ve all lost out on Alt’s and there’s not going to be an Alt season!!",2024-10-26 15:16:59,"I have a largish Crypto portfolio, but it’s been built, not by FOMO, but by trying to do some analysis, based off reality and not hope.  I deliberately decided at the beginning, no BTC or ETH, because I thought they were well established, very little chance to do a 7X plus.   Like many, I wasn’t speculating to double my “FREE” money, I admit I was looking to make a bigger difference.  To do this I needed a Bear Market, and we got a long one starting basically 2022.  The point was to buy down on certain projects, I didn’t want to go all in or even to DCA, my idea was to look for dips and to keep trying to average down and be ready for the BULL.   

While I can see a point of view that the US is in the middle/early Bull, S&P500, BTC are without done well.  However, we can all see, there definitely hasn’t been an Alt Bull run.  But, of course many can point to individual coins that have already done well, for various reasons.  Reasons could be CEX failure, SOL due to FTX, or development, CKB for example.  

The continued dogma regarding “you’ll never see ATH again” and look at Market Cap, persist, yet they’re terrible metrics to use alone.  While it’s true, many won’t reach previous ATH’s, but if a coin/token is 90+% down from ATH, it’s definitely worth buying if it can reach 40%+ of its ATH, or a 4X+. 

I’ve deliberately left out meme coins here, why, because they’re a special breed and they need hype.  I’ve no idea where hype actually comes from, but some get it, while the majority don’t.  So, meme’ are a topic for another time.  

In my portfolio I have many coins still in the red, however, those in the green are at a much higher value, and therefore the portfolio as a total is in the green.   I’ve had many in the last three years go 3X to 7X and I’ve sold making gold profits, which have always been put back into other coins.  I’m even buy back into the coins sold as they’ve gone down enough again for me to believe they’ll make profit again.  

Additionally, along the way certain coins have been abandoned, or sold off as I didn’t believe they would recover sufficiently to compete with other opportunities I came across.  

I believe we’re poised to see a whole crypto upturn in the relatively near future, with 2025 being a year of reward for those that have believed in the “Return of the Alt’s”

Just an alternative view of the world, which I thought I’d bore you all with while I was rambling.  However, none of us posting these views, either way, are experts or prophets, believe in your strategy, refine it to suit circumstances.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,U.S. Elections: Setting Stage for a 2024-2025 Bull Run?,2024-10-27 09:00:48,"Looking at how previous U.S. elections lined up with crypto cycles, there’s definitely a trend worth watching.

The election itself doesn’t start a bull run, but it seems to give it an extra push. In 2016 and 2020, crypto was already on an upswing, and the election acted like a momentum boost.

This time around, with the 2024 election just a week ahead, and with the past April's halving, we’ve got even more factors potentially setting things up for a strong bull run. We now have spot ETFs on the largest crypto already, bringing in institutional interest and liquidity like never before. Plus, if Trump wins, there’s a chance for regulatory shake-ups. He’s known to be more pro-economics and crypto-friendly, which could mean changes at the SEC, possibly replacing folks like Gary Gensler, who’s been pretty tough on crypto.

Looking forward to 2025, any moves toward friendlier regulations could make the U.S. a safer, more appealing place for crypto companies, sparking more investment and innovation. Combine that with post-halving supply constraints, and there’s a strong setup for a potential bull run. So while elections don’t create bull markets, the timing and policies coming out of this one might just add some serious fuel to the fire.

Looking at the below chart, it does look like the history is to repeat again. We are aligned.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Bolivia Takes a Bold Step Amid an Economical Crisis: Pioneers Regulated Crypto Custody Service (USDT), Expanding Financial Options for Citizens",2024-10-26 16:35:36,"In a move that promises to transform the Bolivian financial landscape, Banco Bisa has announced the implementation of an innovative custody service for virtual assets, specifically USDT, that allows clients to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies safely and efficiently. Franco Urquidi, Vice President of Business at the financial institution, highlighted that all transactions must be made to and from an account at Banco Bisa, which guarantees a high level of security. 

This new service offers clients the possibility of holding funds in USDT for as long as they wish, making payments abroad and even sending money to relatives studying abroad. “The sky is the limit,” said Urquidi, referring to the future functionalities that the bank plans to offer in this area.

 USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain its value at parity with the US dollar. This makes it a “stablecoin” or stable currency, whose value is backed by dollar reserves. The idea is that each USDT in circulation is backed by a dollar in the accounts of Tether Limited, the company that issues this currency, which helps stabilize its price. 

The director of the Financial System Supervision Authority (ASFI), Yvette Espinoza, supported the initiative by pointing out that Banco Bisa is a pioneer in offering this service within a regulatory framework that guarantees the security and confidence of users. ""This is a custody service that will allow clients to carry out various operations safely, reducing the risk of unsafe interactions in the cryptocurrency market,"" said Espinoza.

The vice president of Banco Bisa also emphasized the importance of financial education in the use of virtual assets. To this end, the bank has established strategic alliances with recognized international custody and exchange companies, thus ensuring data protection and the prevention of illicit activities. ""Our clients go through a rigorous verification process, which gives them the peace of mind that their transactions are carried out through safe and reliable channels,"" added Urquidi.

 Furthermore, the cost of this service is affordable. USDT sales start at a minimum of 200 USDT up to a daily limit of 10,000, with fees ranging from 35 to 100 bolivianos, depending on the amount. Transfers to dollar accounts abroad cost Bs 280, representing an attractive option for those looking to use cryptocurrencies for international payments. 

With the recent authorization from ASFI for other financial entities to also offer services related to virtual assets, Banco Bisa is positioned as a leader in innovation in the Bolivian market. The entity is committed to training its users, ensuring that they understand both the benefits and risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies.

In short, Banco Bisa is not only ushering in a new era in the Bolivian financial sector, but is also setting a standard in security and financial education in the use of virtual assets. ""The future looks promising for those looking to explore the world of cryptocurrencies in Bolivia,"" Urquidi highlighted.

[ASFI \(Bolivian Financial Regulator\) director Yvette Espinoza was at the press conference giving her support to the financial institution and stressed that innovation in financial services should be developed in a coordinated manner with the regulator and the Government.](https://preview.redd.it/1surkhlho4xd1.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e6c8cb67b8240ac55f38ae92333dfa370010c46)

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Step by Step Guide on Predicting a Potential Flash Crash ,2024-10-26 17:30:07,"Hi all, 

In the above post I put together for you, we will look at a step by step method to predicting the possibility of a major flash crash on Bitcoin. 

Note that Bitcoin will chase liquidity (always has always will) - this does not mean Bitcoin is going to zero. The potential flash crash will be down and up, and over the net 2-5 years I suspect we will see a Bitcoin worth $200,000 and more. 

This is truly a question of “how manipulated is the market” and how much incentive do exchanges have with stopping our the copious amount of long positions on the chart. As I present with DXY, we can anticipate a bull run in Bitcoin just beginning, the biggest bull run we have ever seen on crypto. 

Is it possible that we see a flash crash prior to that major pivot on the US dollar? We shall find out. 

I hope you find my efforts enjoyable or at least entertaining

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Curious what the sentiment is regarding crypto going mainstream. IMHO I think crypto will slowly fade into nothing or at most, a tiny community of speculators. ",2024-10-26 18:23:55,"I promise this is not a troll post. I am legitimately curious. 

From 2016 to 2023, I was deeply involved in the crypto and blockchain space, working on blockchain tech and collaborating closely with several prominent projects. Back then, I was enthusiastic about these “legitimate” initiatives that seemed to address real problems.

Now that I no longer have any personal or professional ties to crypto, I see things differently. As an outsider with significant knowledge, I’m no longer “drinking the Kool-Aid.” While I still believe blockchain technology has its merits in solving certain issues, I strongly feel that the financial aspect of “crypto” will gradually fade away. For years, I’ve heard statements like, “As soon as crypto/blockchain solves X, it will become mainstream,” and “Project/technology X will push crypto mainstream.” I’ve witnessed many problems being solved (reducing wallet friction, increasing transactions per second, enabling cross-chain transactions, and so on) yet here we are, still having the same conversations we had over eight years ago when I was involved. Nothing has changed.

I think it’s entertaining to speculate and essentially gamble occasionally, and people will continue to make some gains. However, regarding crypto becoming mainstream, I personally don’t think it’s going to happen.

If you mention blockchain or crypto to anyone on the outside the general sentiment is it’s a bunch of degens hoping to go to the moon so they can get their purple Lambo. It’s actually a shame because the financial aspect of “crypto” has completely overshadowed the real-world solutions that blockchain as a technology can and is providing.

Now it worked all right until recently where the CEO went Bananas and I think it is due to the company bleeding too much money. Now the PLU can't be redeemed and you are deemed unproductive and account locked if you try to.

They are basically closing the way out in a similar kind of Pig Butchering scam where you can only redeem money if you add MORE money.

And so people got upset and went to Coffeezilla. But in a turn of event, the FEO of plutus decided to contact acoffeezilla to say nothing is true.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Revenue Procedure 2024-28: What You Need to Know + Strategy On Allocation (USA),2024-10-25 14:24:10,"*USA Only*

# Background

Earlier this year, the IRS released [Revenue Procedure 2024-28](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-24-28.pdf), implementing changes with significant impacts to how taxpayers are allowed to track cost basis **effective January 1, 2025**.

I've seen some chatter, speculation, and misinformation across various sources and subreddits regarding this. I'm a licensed CPA (CA) and would like to clarify what is changing, what isn't changing, and how to go about the change in order to remain compliant.

# Universal Cost Tracking vs Wallet-Based Cost Tracking

Most people have multiple wallets and multiple exchanges. If you sell and asset, you need to determine the cost basis for that asset in order to calculate your gain or loss. As discussed later, the default method is First-In-First-Out (""FIFO""), meaning if you have multiple ETH, and sell just one ETH, the cost to be used would be your first ETH purchased of the bunch.

**Wallet-Based Cost Tracking:** Wallet-Based Cost Tracking looks at each wallet individually and requires you to track cost at the wallet by wallet level. Meaning if you had 3 ETH in Wallet A and 5 ETH in Wallet B, and then you sold one ETH from Wallet B, the cost basis to be used would be the earliest purchased ETH **from Wallet B only.** Under Wallet-Based Cost Tracking, since you sold from Wallet B, you must pull the cost basis from that wallet and cannot pull the cost basis from any other wallet.

**Universal Cost Tracking:** Under Universal Cost Tracking, cost basis is not required to be tracked at the wallet level, but rather looked at holistically. In that same example where you have 3 ETH in Wallet A and 5 ETH in Wallet B, if you sell 1 ETH from Wallet B, then **all 8 ETH should be considered when determining the earliest cost basis ETH**. Meaning, if your earliest purchased ETH was in Wallet A, this is the cost basis tax lot that should be used in calculating your gain/loss even though the actual asset was being sold from Wallet B. In other words, your cost basis tax lots are not separated by wallets but are rather looked at all together.

# Prior to Rev Proc 24-28

Prior to this new rev proc, taxpayers largely relied on [IRS Crypto FAQs 39-41](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions) for guidance on cost basis for digital assets. Notably, First-In-First-Out (FIFO) is the default cost basis method for tax payers, with no obligation to track cost basis at the wallet level (this is called the ""universal cost tracking"" method). However, if certain data requirements are met, **including wallet-based cost tracking,** taxpayers could elect to utilize the Specific Identification (Spec ID) method instead. This method allows taxpayers to specifically identify the cost basis tax lots being sold, giving way for more tax-favorable methods such as LIFO, HIFO, Optimized HIFO, etc.

# Post Rev Proc 24-28

Effective January 1, 2025, **ALL taxpayers will be required to track cost basis at the wallet level.** In other words, if you have ETH in Wallet A and ETH in Wallet B, and then you sell some ETH in Wallet B, you cannot pull the cost basis from Wallet A (which was previously allowed when wallet based cost tracking was not required).

Tax payers have been given a Safe Harbor to ""reasonably allocate"" their cost basis as of the start of 2025. In other words, if you were using FIFO and not using wallet-based cost tracking, you will need to assess all of your current tax lots and allocate them based on your actual holdings in each wallet/exchange. After the allocation is made, and all wallets and exchanges have cost basis tax lots assigned to them, the allocation will be considered complete and from that point forward cost basis will need to be tracked at the wallet level. Meaning assets sold from Wallet A will need to have their cost basis pulled from Wallet A, even if you are just using FIFO.

# How to Allocate Cost Basis

I won't sugarcoat this, this will be a huge challenge for most people. This will require that you have detailed records showing all of your tax lots as of 11:59PM on 12/31/2024. While software tools have been imperative to accurate tax preparation and reporting, without proper features to implement this transition, users will be largely unable to ""finesse"" the software to allocate the transition. On the bright side, it seems like the major softwares have this on their radar and are working on a solution. I have been in touch with a few different softwares, including the team at Koinly, Bitwave, and others, and they have indicated that their team is working on solutions for an easy transition.

If you don't use a software, then you will have to do this allocation manually in excel. To do so, you'll need to aggregate all of your tax lots as of 11:59PM 12/31/2024 into a list. Then, you will need to look at all of your wallets/exchanges and their balances as of that time. After that, start assigning each tax lot to a wallet until you get to the right amount of crypto held in that wallet at that time. This process will be very manual and very painful, I suggest using a software instead.

# Do We Have to Use FIFO?

No, while FIFO will remain the default, if you meet the data requirements in Q40 of the crypto FAQ you can still utilize specific ID to cherry pick which assets are being sold. Really, the only big change here is that wallet based cost tracking will be required for those using FIFO now (was already required for those using specific ID).

# My Thoughts on Allocation Approach

My thoughts for softwares is that each cost basis tax lot can be proportionally split between the wallets based on the amount of crypto that is in each wallet. For example, if Wallet A has 1 ETH and Wallet B has 3 ETH, then each individual cost basis tax lot should have 1/4th allocated to Wallet A and 3/4ths allocated to Wallet B. This approach *should* be fairly easy from a software perspective and would allow for a very easy transition for users.

A second approach would be to assign a hierchy based on either short/long holding period or high/low cost basis. For instance, a user might just want Wallet B to have the lowest cost basis ETH and Wallet A to have the highest cost basis. In that instance, the software would look at all of the cost basis tax lots and assign them accordingly based on the user's hierarchy assigned. This approach seems like it may be more difficult to implement from a software perspective, but hey what do I know I am not a software engineer.

I would love to hear the community's thoughts on additional approaches to make the transition as easy as possible for users. Let me know if there is a better way!

# TLDR

* Wallet based cost tracking will now be required for those previously using FIFO with the universal method
* Those people will need to allocate their cost basis as of January 1, 2025
* FIFO is NOT required moving forward, but remains the default (Specific ID is still allowed)",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Fundamentally ETH has better decentralisation, more TVL etc, but SOL has the narrative at the moment at least.

I’ve seen good arguments how ETH/BTC tends to drop until Q4 or so, and then rallies. But I’ve also seen arguments about how L2s have taken away the value prop for ETH.

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

2 Private keys x1 & x2, corresponding Public Keys P1 = x1G & P2 = x2G.

If I sign (Schnorr Signature) with x, does it only prove possession of the private key corresponding to P or does it also prove possession of the 2 individual public keys x1 & x2? Or if not proof of possession of both x1 & x2, does it atleast prove something more than just x?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations?

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 11:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-10-27 12:17:00.242026
