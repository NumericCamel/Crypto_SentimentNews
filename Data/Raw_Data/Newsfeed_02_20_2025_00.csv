A crypto analyst who identified this bearish trend in the Solana price action has projected a drastic crash to new lows at $22.  Solana Price Action Mirrors LUNA’s Catastrophic Collapse A pseudonymous crypto analyst on TradingView named PizzaDriver has released a recent technical analysis of the Solana price action. The market expert predicts that Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could soon decline to drastic lows. Related Reading: Solana Price Will Complete 1,800% Surge To $4,000 With This Formation: Analyst The analyst drew parallels between Solana’s current chart structure and the LUNA meltdown of 2022. The weekly chart highlights that Solana has formed a Double Top pattern, a classic bearish reversal signal from an uptrend to a downtrend. This pattern appears like the letter “M”, creating two peaks and a dip in between. This pattern also signifies deteriorating momentum in the Solana price, as the cryptocurrency has been facing severe volatility. In addition to the Double Top pattern, Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exhibited a bearish divergence. This means that while its price attempted to reach new highs, it was unable to due to underlying weakness. This same RSI bearish divergence was observed in LUNA before its infamous market crash, which triggered a decline to a zero level.  According to the TradingView analyst, if Solana fails to hold key support levels and breaks below them, it could trigger a widespread liquidity crisis that would send its price plummeting to $22, a significant historical support level last seen in 2022.  Adding to the already concerning price outlook, major institutional investors appear to have already sold their holdings and taken profits at price highs. Ahead of the bull run, these investors have reportedly reallocated funds into other somewhat safer coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB), which have been seeing steady growth in on-chain activities and have risen in value over the week. This redistribution increases the risk of a rapid sell-off, further weakening Solana’s fundamentals.  Rug Pulls And High Fees Weigh On Solana Beyond bearish technical indicators and price forecasts, the Solana ecosystem is currently experiencing a rise in investor dissatisfaction. PizzaDriver revealed that the Solana blockchain has become a primary space for meme coins and speculative trading. Additionally, there are allegations of rug pulls and project abandonment in the ecosystem, leaving investors with a sour experience. Related Reading: Solana Forms Ascending Triangle For Possible Breakout, Analyst Sets $565 Target Many developers have allegedly created and launched projects, stolen investors’ funds, and disappeared, thus eroding trust in the network. Moreover, Solana’s transaction fees have skyrocketed, hitting record highs and contradicting its original appeal as a low-cost transaction alternative to Ethereum.  As a result, investors have begun shifting focus to long-term projects with transparent roadmaps, security audits, and strong partnerships. Due to its numerous ecosystem dilemmas, the TradingView analyst disclosed that Solana risks losing its dominant position unless it addresses these fundamental challenges.

However, some market observers noted that not all is lost in the recent slide of Bitcoin, saying what seems to be an unfavorable condition offers opportunities for long-term investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1.35? Analyst Predicts Milestone ‘Within 70 Days’ Downward Trend Analysts said that a weakening buying pressure on Bitcoin might be a cue that the crypto is entering a downward trend phase with some observers saying that BTC is already within the negative pressure zone. “Bitcoin’s buying pressure has decreased over the last 60 days, allowing room for selling pressure,” Joao Wedson, Founder & CEO of Alphractal, said in a post. Bitcoin’s buying pressure has decreased over the last 60 days, allowing room for selling pressure. Negative regions present two opportunities: 🔸Favoring short positions 🔸They signal that the downtrend may continue or has occurred, creating an opportunity to accumulate BTC. pic.twitter.com/dApRsS9Ihf — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) February 17, 2025 Crypto analysts noted that this condition might lead to a decline in price which could be both good and bad for digital assets traders. Data shows that Bitcoin is having a hard time maintaining a bullish momentum as its price hovers around $95,912 per coin. Two Opportunities Wedson said that BTC has been experiencing a decline in buying pressure in the last two months, noting that the market shift could offer something positive to its investors. “Negative regions present two opportunities,” the CEO noted. He enumerated that among the opportunities is “favoring short positions” which could be a good sign for traders. Another bright spot is the weakened buying pressure that indicates the “downtrend may continue or has occurred, creating an opportunity to accumulate BTC.” In other words, the current condition of Bitcoin could give investors a chance to build their BTC portfolio by buying more coins. The Buy/Sell Pressure Delta Chart In a post, Wedson presented two charts of the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta to illustrate the shifting dynamics between buying and selling activity in Bitcoin, which has been going on in the past 60 days. Wedson explained that if the market is dominated by sell pressure, investors can take advantage of the downward momentum by entering short positions. According to historical data, negative pressure zones usually align with a continued decrease in price, a potentially profitable opportunity for traders betting on further price declines. Meanwhile, the Alphractal executive showed in the graph that a high sell pressure commonly indicates a bearish sentiment, adding that this is a great opportunity for long-term traders to increase their BTC holdings. Analysts explained accumulating more Bitcoin during this period allows long-term investors to position themselves for a future recovery. “The decrease in buying pressure is a significant factor to consider. While short positions might seem attractive in a downtrend, the potential for accumulation also presents a compelling long-term strategy,” a crypto investor commented on Wedson’s post.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,How Close Is Bitcoin To A Bear Market? This Historical Level May Contain Hints,2025-02-19 21:30:22+00:00,"A Bitcoin on-chain level has historically served as the boundary for bear markets. Here’s how far the asset’s price is currently from this line. Bitcoin Is Above Realized Price Of All Major Cohorts Right Now In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed where the Realized Price currently stands for some of the important Bitcoin investor groups. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor on the BTC network. When the spot price is above this metric, it means the holders as a whole are in a state of profit, while it being under the indicator suggests the dominance of loss. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Won’t Break Out—Analytics Firm Reveals the Cause Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by Young Ju, which shows the trend in its value for four Bitcoin cohorts: As is visible in the above graph, Bitcoin is above the Realized Price of all of these groups right now, so their members would all be sitting on some unrealized gains. Historically, the average cost basis of these cohorts has held some significance for the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s apparent that the price has generally followed a bullish trajectory whenever it has been above the Realized Price of the New Whales (colored in orange). The New Whales, also called the Short-Term Holder Whales, refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days and are holding more than 1,000 BTC. The Realized Price currently stands at $89,300 for this cohort, which means BTC could be at risk of retesting it in the near future if the bearish trajectory continues. A potential dip under the level, though, wouldn’t immediately signal a shift towards a bear market; it would only imply a lack of momentum behind Bitcoin. The level that BTC may have to avoid falling under in order to avoid a bearish regime is the Miner Whales (green). The Miner Whales refer to the wallets of mining companies that hold over 1,000 BTC. The CryptoQuant founder has explained that BTC’s plunges under the mark during the last couple of cycles have all led to bear markets. At present, the Realized Price of the Miner Whales is situated at $58,000. From the current price, Bitcoin would have to go through a drawdown of almost 40% in order to approach a retest of this line. If the level will indeed once again act as a boundary for the bear market in this cycle, then BTC may be considered at a safe distance for now. Related Reading: Glassnode Reveals Where Bitcoin Could Find Support If Current Level Breaks Down While the asset tends to see breaks both above and below the cost basis of three of the cohorts over the course of a cycle, it has never broken under the Realized Price of the fourth group, the Old Whales or Long-Term Holder Whales. These whales, who have been resolutely holding Bitcoin since more than 155 days ago, have their average acquisition level at around $26,000 right now. BTC Price Bitcoin witnessed a plunge under the $94,000 level yesterday, but it would appear that the coin has already found a rebound as its price is now back at $96,200.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring,2025-02-19 20:00:29+00:00,"XRP’s price trajectory has had ups and downs in the past two weeks. Particularly, the large part of the past seven days was characterized by a notable decline from $2.8 to $2.5 before rebounding at this level.  Interestingly, this fall towards $2.5 was highlighted by a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform, who also noted a breakout potential. Crypto analyst TehThomas previously identified the $2.5 level as a key Fair Value Gap (FVG) that could act as strong support and recent price movements suggest that buyers are now stepping in after hitting this level.   XRP Tests Key Fair Value Gap At $2.50 TehThomas’ analysis highlighted $2.50 as a significant liquidity zone where XRP could establish support before continuing its uptrend. This level has acted as an imbalance in price action during this cycle and has often caused a reaction as traders step in to fill the gap. At the time of the analysis, XRP was trading at $2.64, but the analyst noted that the cryptocurrency could keep falling until it reaches $2.5 and rebounds upwards.  Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Why The Target Is $8 Over the past two days, XRP has moved in line with this projection. The cryptocurrency retraced from $2.64, dipping to as low as $2.47 before showing a swift recovery. The rapid bounce from this zone indicates that buy orders were concentrated at this level, and bulls who anticipated a reaction here also stepped in. Now that the decline and rebound have played out as expected, the focus is now on how XRP will behave in the next few days. Having tested and respected this $2.5 support zone, the next question is whether the bulls can build on this momentum and push upward. Demand Zone To Send The Altcoin Soaring With the Fair Value Gap showing signs of acting as strong support, crypto analyst TehThomas believes the next critical step for XRP is breaking above a descending resistance trendline. The breakout point for this descending resistance trendline is around $2.65, and the path between $2.5 and $2.6 is the demand zone for opening long positions. However, there is also the possibility of a retest of the descending resistance trendline after a breakout. If the XRP price can successfully retest and hold above the trendline, it will provide confirmation of the bullish momentum for a further upside move. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Should this scenario play out, XRP’s next target sits at $3.00, which is another key Fair Value Gap. TehThomas notes that reclaiming this level could trigger an extended rally, with further upside potential beyond $3 depending on market conditions. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.55.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Solana Sweeps Lows But Recovers – Can Bulls Reclaim $185 by Friday?,2025-02-19 18:30:56+00:00,"Solana has experienced intense selling pressure, now trading at its lowest levels since November 2024 and erasing all the gains from the post-election rally. Once a leader in the altcoin market, Solana is now facing serious risks as the meme coin euphoria that fueled its rise has turned into a bloodbath, raising concerns about its long-term sustainability. Related Reading: Altseason At Risk? Expert Believes Ethereum Must Hold $2,600 To Sustain Momentum The speculative frenzy surrounding meme coins initially drove massive transaction volumes and liquidity to the Solana ecosystem. However, as the hype fades and major sell-offs continue, the impact is now weighing heavily on SOL’s price action. Analysts suggest that the rapid cycle of speculation and liquidation has left Solana vulnerable to further downside. Crypto analyst Jelle shared an analysis on X, revealing that SOL took out the recent lows but managed to close above the previous lows, signaling a potential relief move. Jelle emphasized that this could be a crucial moment for SOL, as reclaiming key levels could ignite a strong recovery. However, the coming days will be critical, as the market awaits confirmation of a bounce or further downside. Investors are closely watching Solana’s price action, as it teeters on the edge of a major move. Solana Testing Critical Demand Levels Solana has faced massive selling pressure since reaching its all-time high in late January, with its price now struggling to recover amid a broader downturn in the altcoin market. Negative sentiment continues to dominate as the meme coin frenzy that once fueled Solana’s growth has turned into a liability, dragging down liquidity and investor confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Realized Profit Reveals Strong Support Level – Time For A Breakout? The rapid rise and fall of speculative meme coins on the Solana network have created an unstable trading environment, with traders hesitant to reinvest in the ecosystem. This shift has led to a decline in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, further exacerbating Solana’s struggle to maintain bullish momentum. The network’s fundamentals remain strong, but price action suggests that investors are growing cautious. Jelle’s analysis on X reveals that SOL took out the recent lows but managed to close above the previous lows. While this signals a potential relief move, it is far from confirming a full recovery. Jelle wants to see a strong bounce from here—ideally with SOL reclaiming $185 before the end of business on Friday. Traders and investors are keeping a close watch on the 3-day and weekly candle closes to determine the next major move for Solana. A successful reclaim of the $185 level could restore confidence and push the price back toward $200. However, failure to do so might lead to further downside pressure, as Solana remains vulnerable to broader market movements and the ongoing volatility in the meme coin sector. SOL Price Trying To Reclaim Key Levels Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $173, holding above the crucial $170 support level. Bulls must defend this price to maintain short-term momentum and prevent a deeper correction. A push above the $185 mark is essential for a recovery, as this level aligns with the 200-day moving average, a key indicator of long-term strength. Reclaiming this level would signal a shift in momentum and open the door for a stronger upside move toward higher resistance levels. However, if SOL fails to push above the $185 mark in the coming days, selling pressure could intensify, leading to another downturn. Bears remain in control as long as the price stays below this critical threshold, and a rejection at $185 could trigger further downside, potentially revisiting support around $160 or lower. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pulls Back To ‘The Golden Ratio’ – Analyst Expects A Bullish Reversal The coming days will be crucial for Solana, as traders watch for confirmation of a reversal or a continuation of the bearish trend.

Market sentiment remains fragile, with investors closely monitoring price action for any signs of a sustainable recovery.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Flashes Oversold Signal—Rebound Ahead?,2025-02-19 17:00:47+00:00,"Dogecoin has once again dipped into oversold territory on its 4-hour chart on Tuesday, marking the most pronounced level of selling pressure since the sudden capitulation on February 3. During that episode, the price plunged to around $0.20 before rebounding by 45% within the same trading day—a move that underscored how quickly Dogecoin can rally from oversold conditions. Dogecoin Price Plunges Into Oversold Zone In an analysis today, crypto Analyst Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) highlights an RSI reading that has dipped to 30 on Tuesday, indicating that selling pressure may be nearing its limit. Dogecoin’s path to this oversold level began after it failed to maintain momentum near $0.28. The cryptocurrency currently trades around $0.25, a zone that Abbé identifies as historically prone to strong support. He suggests that negative sentiment toward memecoins triggered by the LIBRA meme coin disaster by Argentinian President Javier Milei appears to have reached unprecedented lows. This, according to him, could paradoxically create an attractive accumulation opportunity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Repeating History? This Setup Led To 150% Gains Abbé projects that Dogecoin could stage a short-term push to $0.30, a psychologically significant level that coincides with prior resistance. A move beyond $0.30 could open the door for a test of the yearly high, although a sustained uptrend may hinge on how broader market sentiment evolves and whether broader risk-appetite improves. “DOGE has reached its most oversold level since the February 3rd capitulation. Sentiment for memes has reached an all-time low, which also presents a good opportunity to accumulate cult memecoins. I’m expecting a short-term move towards $0.3, followed by a new yearly high,” Abbé concludes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Signal Flashes: Analyst Warns Of A Potential 40% Drop On Monday, Abbé also discussed a recurring bullish pattern visible on the 3-day chart of Dogecoin. He traced three distinct descending channels in Dogecoin’s price action—one in Q4 2023, another in Q3 2024, and the current one unfolding in early 2025. In both of the previous instances, Dogecoin broke above the descending channel’s upper boundary, sparking gains exceeding 150%. Abbé points out that Dogecoin appears to be following a similar downward-sloping channel today, ranging from approximately $0.36 at its upper boundary to around $0.24 at its lower end. If the same pattern holds true, a decisive break above the channel’s resistance could trigger another triple-digit percentage rally. However, if Dogecoin moves below that lower boundary, the bullish setup observed in the prior two breakouts would face potential invalidation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"This Analyst Called The Bitcoin Price Crash Early, Total Prediction Says More Pain Is Coming",2025-02-19 15:30:25+00:00,"Crypto analyst Akademik, who called the Bitcoin price crash early has revealed his total predictions for the flagship crypto’s trajectory in the short and mid-term. Based on these predictions, BTC is set to experience a further crash which could send its price to as low as $80,000.  What Next For The Bitcoin Price  In a TradingView post, Akademik predicted that the Bitcoin price could drop to as low as $80,000 while revealing his short trading strategy for the flagship crypto going forward. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could pull back to the $80,000 range or even drop to as low as $60,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action: Why The Next 30 Days Could Be A Game-Changer For The Market While outlining his trading strategy to keep shorting BTC, he said he expects this downtrend for the flagship crypto to continue. The analyst told traders that it is possible to enter at the trend level, which he highlighted on the charts if there is an activity in the feed or volumes will be substituted.  Indeed, the Bitcoin price currently boasts a bearish outlook as it dropped to the $93,000 range yesterday before bouncing back above the psychological $95,000 support level. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez provided insights into the current price action and how the flagship crypto is at risk if dropping lower.  In an X post, he stated that the Bitcoin price faces a supply wall of 1.88 million BTC at $97,000, while the support at $94,500 is backed by just 695,000 BTC. Martinez remarked that this imbalance could play a key role in the next move. This indicates that there is a greater supply than demand for the flagship crypto, which puts it at risk of dropping lower before it rallies to new highs.  In another X post, the analyst also noted that a decline in Bitcoin’s mining activity has historically been followed by prolonged price corrections. This suggests BTC could still drop lower before another rally to new local highs.  BTC’s Long Term Outlook Is Still Bullish In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the long-term trend for the Bitcoin price remains bullish. This came as he noted that Bitcoin is still in the consolidation range. He added that as long as BTC stays within the range, there is no clear short-term direction for the flagship crypto.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price In Trouble? Bearish Divergence That Led To Market Crash Last Cycle Returns Meanwhile, Martinez stated that the market is currently in the ‘depression’ stage of the market cycle. This suggests that the Bitcoin price is still bound to record one last pump before this cycle ends.

With governments around the world becoming more crypto-positive, there has never been a better time to build a solid crypto portfolio. As more pro-crypto legislation is passed, trading and investing in digital assets will become easier, as well as more rewarding. If you’re also looking to invest in digital assets, here are some of the best new cryptos you should consider purchasing. 1. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) – Best New Crypto to Buy to Benefit from $BTC’s Growth BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is a new community-driven token designed to ride Bitcoin’s journey. Instead of simply cheering on Bitcoin as it inches closer to new all-time highs, you can join the ‘BTC Bull Army’ and become a part of Bitcoin’s unprecedented growth story. It’s the ONLY meme coin out there that will airdrop real $BTC to token holders when Bitcoin reaches new major milestones ($150K, $200K, $250K, and beyond). Furthermore, the developers will burn a part of the total $BTCBULL supply every time Bitcoin’s price rises by $25K. The first token burn event, therefore, will be when $BTC reaches $125K. Then at $150K, $175K, and so on. This will maintain the token’s demand and keep its intrinsic value high at all times. Simply put, where $BTC acts as a store of wealth, $BTCBULL could be the creation of it. The BTC Bull presale saw one of the most rockstar openings of all time. It raised $200K+ in just hours after its launch on February 10 and is currently sitting on more than $2.3M in presale funding. You can become an early investor now for only $0.00237 per token. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Crypto Offering Crypto Trading Calls MIND of Pepe ($MIND), arguably the top AI agent token, is set to revolutionize the way people approach crypto investing. As AI adoption accelerates, industries across the board—including crypto—are exploring how cutting-edge AI can unlock new possibilities. With its innovative approach, $MIND is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-powered investing. $MIND is an autonomous AI entity that engages in crypto-related interactions on online platforms like X. There, it imbibes every single opinion and insight into the crypto economy and various tokens. Finally, it organizes the gazillion bits of data it has collected, studies it, and points its token holders towards cryptocurrencies that are actually worth buying. What’s more, $MIND is also self-evolving, meaning it learns and grows from every single interaction. It’ll ultimately reach a point where it’ll be able to create its own tokens based on market hype. And $MIND token holders will be in a pole position to benefit from all this. Join the $MIND community for trading insights that could possibly let you 100x your investment. The project is currently in presale, where it has already raised over $6.5M. Each token is currently being offered at a low price of $0.0033587. For more info, check out our guide on how to buy $MIND. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Official Token of Best Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of the most user-friendly and versatile crypto wallet available right now, Best Wallet. This is a self-custodial crypto wallet, meaning no one has access to your crypto but you. With access to over 60 blockchains, you’ll be able to manage your crypto portfolio from one single place. Moreover, Best Wallet is also incredibly secure. After all, it employs advanced cryptographic techniques, multi-factor authentication, and biometrics. $BEST holders won’t just benefit from the Best Wallet App’s growth. They’ll also unlock exclusive perks within the Best Wallet ecosystem. These include priority access to new meme coin presales, lower transaction fees, and higher staking rewards. The $BEST presale has quickly become one of the biggest crypto presales of this year. Although far from over, it has already managed to raise more than $10M. 1 $BEST is currently available for $0.02405. But interested investors should hurry up because prices increase in the next few hours. 4. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) – CZ’s Pet Dog-Inspired Meme Coin FirstBroccoli is breaking new highs every single day. It’s now up a mind-boggling 1,200% since its debut less than a week ago. At the time of writing, it appears like the token is consolidating, potentially readying itself for another leg up higher. It’s worth noting that $BROCCOLI is the perfect example of what hype-backed and community-driven meme coins can do. It’s inspired by the pet dog of Binance’s ex-CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. All it took was CZ teasing his X audience with the idea of launching a pet meme coin of his own. A seasoned meme coin enthusiast noticed this, built FirstBroccoli, and gave the world the next 100x cryptocurrency. Verdict All of the above-mentioned tokens are undoubtedly among the best new cryptos to buy, as they stand to benefit the most from new economies such as Hong Kong embracing crypto. But are they outside the purview of the overall market volatility? Unfortunately, no. That means only investing an amount that’s small enough for you and having the stomach to sit through the market’s turbulence. Additionally, this article isn’t meant to be financial advice. We strongly recommend doing your own research before investing your hard-earned dough in crypto.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Dogecoin Price Consolidates In Symmetrical Expanding Triangle, What’s Next For DOGE?",2025-02-19 14:00:52+00:00,"Dogecoin (DOGE)  is once again making waves in the crypto market. This time, it’s due to a fascinating technical pattern forming on its price chart: a symmetrical expanding triangle. Known for signaling periods of heightened volatility and potential breakout opportunities, this pattern has traders and investors on the edge of their seats, wondering what’s next for DOGE. The symmetrical expanding triangle is a rare and dynamic formation, marked by its widening price range and converging trendlines. For Dogecoin, this pattern reflects a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with neither side gaining a clear upper hand yet. As the triangle continues to develop, the likelihood of a decisive price movement grows, setting the stage for an explosive breakout or breakdown. Analyzing Dogecoin’s Current Price Action Within The Expanding Triangle Dogecoin’s price action within the symmetrical expanding triangle suggests heightened market indecision as both bulls and bears attempt to assert dominance. The widening nature of the triangle indicates increasing volatility, with each price swing becoming more extreme. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Stuck In Limbo—What’s Holding Back The Recovery? Currently, DOGE is oscillating between the upper resistance trendline and the lower support trendline of the expanding triangle. Each swing is becoming more pronounced, with a higher high of $0.2923 and a lower low of $0.2403, reflecting increasing market uncertainty and aggressive trading activity.  These key support and resistance trendlines will determine the next major move. If buyers push the price toward the upper boundary, a breakout could signal a bullish continuation. Conversely, a drop toward the lower trendline hints at a possible bearish breakdown.  Volume trends and technical indicators like RSI will provide further confirmation of market sentiment as DOGE approaches a decisive move. A rising RSI toward the 50% threshold may indicate a strengthening upside momentum, whereas a continued downward move might reinforce the bearish outlook. Furthermore, an uptick in volume alongside a price surge would support a sustained rally while declining volume leads to weakening conviction among market participants. Key Levels To Watch For A Confirmed Breakout As DOGE continues to trade within a symmetrical expanding triangle, identifying key levels for a confirmed breakout is crucial for traders and investors. When a bullish or bearish breakout occurs, it could signal the start of a new trend, making it essential to monitor these levels closely. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rally To $0.35 Could Trigger Massive Short Squeeze Specifically, a strong close above the upper boundary of the pattern near $0.2923, coupled with a notable surge in trading volume, would confirm an upward breakout. This move will probably pave the way for further growth, driving the price toward $0.3563 or beyond. However, If DOGE fails to hold support near $0.2403, selling pressure could intensify, pushing the price down to $0.1800 or lower. A sustained bearish move below this level points to a deeper correction, bringing historical support zones into focus.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Best ERC-20 Altcoins to Buy as Ether Reserves Record Historical All-Time Lows,2025-02-19 13:28:54+00:00,"Ether supply on exchanges is now at a 9-year low: specifically 18.95 million ETH as of February 18, at the time of writing. This suggests investors are now moving $ETH into cold storage, presumably for long-term HODLing purposes. If the ecosystem is overall looking to hold, rather than trade Ether, the historic all-time lows supply significantly increases the odds of ‘supply shock’ occurring, which would inevitably power an $ETH bull run and skyrocket the price. Basic economics dictate that a supply shock happens when the demand of an asset exceeds the supply, creating a significant gap. This ultimately results in an increase in price. $ETH has not been able to sustain the $4K mark so far, trading in the range of $4.1K to $2.2K since the last year. However, analysts believe this supply shock could just be what it needs. Add to this the possibility of $ETH staking, which could tighten supply and boost investor confidence in Ethereum as a long-term investment. The BTC and ETH Trains Wait for Nobody Nicolai Sondergaard, a crypto analyst, said that something similar is happening with Bitcoin too. $BTC reserves are now at a 3-year low with only 3.5M $BTC left with exchanges. Swelling demands and a shift towards long-term holdings are big positives for the crypto industry. According to Dr. Jan Wüstenfeld, there’s also less new capital entering the space, and record numbers of tokens being created. This suggests a significant battle for liquidity, perhaps even a dry out in the short term. Of course, it makes sense to be more risk-averse when you’re not sure about the best way forward, even the most degens of crypto degens know that! If you want a piece of the upcoming frenzy, this might just be the right time for fresh investments, and with stablecoins rearing for another bull run, altcoins will almost certainly follow suit. Here are some of the best ERC-20 altcoins that can benefit from surging $ETH and $BTC prices. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best ERC-20 Altcoin to Benefit from $BTC’s Growth BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) doesn’t just reduce the cost of investing in Bitcoin, but also exponentially increases the amount of money you stand to make if and when $BTC catapults to new highs. As the only crypto on the market to give out free $BTC to token holders, BTC Bull will see significant price appreciation alongside Bitcoin’s growth. Is it the next 100x meme coin? Quite possibly, yes. How does it work? If you’re a $BTCBULL holder and you’ve stored the tokens in Best Wallet, you’ll automatically receive $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin reaches the $150K, $200K, and $250K marks. Pretty neat. What’s more, seeing as 40% of the total token supply will be used for PR and marketing, it’s safe to say that BTC Bull will continue being a top trending crypto even months and years after its launch. Investors flocked to BTC Bull as soon as it launched. Barely into its second week, this project has already amassed a whopping $2.3M. Each token is currently available at $0.00237, but this won’t be the case for long as the price is slated to increase very soon. It’s worth noting that although BTC Bull is a Bitcoin-themed altcoin through and through, it’s built on the ERC-20 network to simplify cross-chain transfers and interoperability. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Layer 2 Solution on Solana Solana attracts a lot of meme coin developers thanks to the network’s low transaction fees and ability to rapidly create and trade these cryptos. However, it looks like Solana didn’t take into account just how popular it would get. It’s now struggling with network congestion, frequently failed transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to build the first-ever Layer 2 blockchain for Solana. By leveraging Ethereum’s vast liquidity and Solana’s unmatched efficiency, Solaxy will offer lightning-fast transactions, faster throughputs, and even lower transaction costs on Solana. A value proposition if we’ve ever seen one. A meme coin with real utility (and therefore massive growth potential), it’s hardly a surprise that Solaxy has gone on to become one of the best crypto presales ever. With over $22M in presale funding, $SOLX is still ridiculously cheap: just $0.00164 per token. If this is your first presale purchase, here’s how to buy $SOLX. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Crypto Offering Crypto Trading Calls If you find it difficult to make consistent profits in crypto, you’re certainly not alone. These are tough markets, after all. What if you could leverage cutting-edge AI technology for your crypto investments? That’s exactly what MIND of Pepe ($MIND) does. $MIND is a revolutionary AI agent that interacts with the crypto community online (on dApps and platforms like X), wraps his ‘mind’ around all the hype and varying opinions on thousands of cryptos, and uses hive-mind analysis to narrow down on only the very best cryptos to invest in. All you have to do to receive these early-stage investment calls (as well as tons of other exclusive perks) is be a $MIND holder, a fantastic nod to and reward for the chads who never sell, who always ask ‘what’s an exit strategy?’ You can do so at the lowest possible cost if you invest in the $MIND presale, which is ongoing and has already raised over $6M. 1 $MIND is currently available for just $0.0033587. If you don’t know where to start, here’s how to buy it. 4. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – Still a Prominent Dog Meme Coin We’ve all seen the explosive debut of FirstBroccoli, a dog-themed meme coin inspired by Binance’s CZ’s very own pet dog. With pet meme coins back in the game (not that they ever left), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), the biggest pet meme coin on ERC-20, is in a pole position to benefit from all the hype. Few dogs can match its cuteness, what can you do. $SHIB has generated sizable gains (+57%) for investors in the last year. Although its price hasn’t really gone anywhere recently, that could just as well be a positive sign indicating that a breakout may be around the corner. Also, Shiba Inu’s exchange netflow has been negative in the last month. This signals at a potential shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. Another bullish signal. $SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001543. ERC Altcoins Are Here to Stay These are hands down the best ERC-20 altcoins to buy and HODL in 2025, at the time of writing. However, that’s not to say that they’re risk-free investments. The crypto market, after all, is full of ups and downs, and you can always lose everything you invest. Liquidity drying up is a concrete sign crypto investors found investments they’re happy with for now and are willing to hold on for a little longer before making any moves. Whether Bitcoin, Ether, or an ERC-20 altcoin, demand outpacing supply is a sign of growing prices. Still, we urge you to do your own research, as none of the above is a substitute for financial advice from a certified professional.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

I myself have not done a ton of trading, i however have made a killing off mining.     here is the list as it stands right now.  please post things to add to it,   if you have a tool you like share it if you describe it or how it works that would be useful as well if not i will get around to it as i work my way down.     i have not used the bots much yet, so making a list of them all.  i will maybe get into more of a breakdown on them but i might just save that work induvial learning so that i can focus this more towards getting people comfortable with the idea of trading crypto.  Thank you for helping.

Things to look for when buying

check twitter, telegram, website   this will give you a sense of the community behind this project, if there is no effort from the developer than this project isnt going to go anywhere more than likely.  Same time if it has all 3 and an active community that doesnt mean it will be a huge success, it would however make it a better option than a coin without any of the 3.  another thing to look at is are the x, website, and telegram they posted actually linked to this project

check holders check top wallets   if they all have big percentages that is a redflag.  These big wallets could tank the price if they sell off.    low cap coin under 200,000 mcap will have high percentage wallets due to smaller market but once it gets past that it would require a bigger investment for someone to gain high percentage of coins.

check buy sell pressure     2m bought 2m sold  means someone is farming that project,  trades that are mirrored are also a red flag.

small marketcap coins buy with less money as with cheap price you get more coins and mitigates your risk alittle.  you can always buy more later. higher marketcap coins buy with more intial as it will take more money to get more coins and with a higher market cap(over a couple million) there is more stability and track record to go off of typically.

set slippage as buy/sell pressure can cancel transaction

Things to look for when selling

Set slippage as buy/sell pressure can cancel transaction

Pulling profits

when you are in profit pull some of the coin, when you 2x take intial out, that way if it keeps going up you still have coins in it.  when it dips down you can buy back in and do the same thing.  This manages losses.  you dont have a realization of profit or loss until it is converted.

Bots

Bots are the fastest way to trade

They are able to snipe in at low mcap on new coins

Reddit,solana,Stay Safe in Crypto Lads,2025-02-19 07:58:06,"If you're in crypto, assume everyone is trying to take your money, Especially influencers, random ""alpha groups,"" and sketchy projects. Here are some tips..  

Influencers & ""Alpha Groups""
You’re Their Exit Liquidity, 99% of influencers and so called “alpha groups” don’t actually care about making you money. They’re just dumping their bags on you while making it seem like they’re giving you solid calls. You might get lucky a few times copy-trading them, but long-term, they always win, and you lose. 

The way to become a real insider is not just from Tiktok, Reddit, X.

The Safeguard Scam
Steals Your Private Keys, There’s a scam going around where they ask you to run a command on your PC. The moment you do, it scans your device for private keys and gives them access to your Telegram as well.  

If you’ve ever done this, reboot your PC immediately and assume you’re compromised.  

Fake Wallets
Some influencers on TikTok and Twitter flex their insane gains, showing off huge wallets. But here’s the trick:  

- The screenshots are photoshopped.  
- If you DM them, they’ll invite you to a video call to ""prove"" it.  
- What they actually have is a cloned version of Trust Wallet or Phantom, which makes their balance look like a whale wallet.  

Ask them to send you a TT (Trust Transaction), just $1 from the actual wallet. If they refuse, it's fake.  

Fake Exchanges
Use CoinMarketCap’s Top 25 (recommended), There are hundreds of scam exchanges offering crazy returns (API), or Sign up bonusses etc..

Only trust top 25 exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap. If it’s not even there listed, assume it’s a scam.  

Dust Attacks
Fake Airdrops That Drain Your Wallet, Ever seen random tokens appear in your wallet? That’s not free money, it’s a scam.  

If you interact with them (sell, trade, stake), you unknowingly approve access to your funds. Scammers can then drain your entire wallet.  

Never touch unknown tokens. Use Phantom’s revoke permissions.

Wallet Drainers
Fake Minting & Staking Sites, Scammers create fake NFT minting or staking sites that look just like the real thing. When you connect your wallet and approve a transaction, they drain everything.  

How to Stay Safe:  
- Always double check.
- Use a burner wallet for minting or staking (clean).

Approval Exploits
Hidden Wallet Drainers, Some Solana dApps trick you into approving unlimited access to your funds. Once you do, they can take everything, anytime.  

Fix This
- Go to Phantom → Connected Apps → Revoke Permissions regularly.  

Be Paranoid, No One Helps You for Free, The harsh truth: everyone in crypto is here to make money, not help you.  

Even people you’ve known for weeks/months could be playing the long game before scamming you. If someone is too eager to “help” you make money, they probably want yours.  

If it sounds too good to be true, it’s a scam.  ",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,solana,Anyone with experience using Nova bot?,2025-02-19 23:42:13,"I was trying to setup Nova to buy a specific CA that had not been released on Radium yet, as it was in pre-sell.  I wanted Nova to ""snipe"" it as soon as it became available, so I setup my snipe task.  And then nothing happened when the coin hit Raydium a couple hours later... I assume sniping is only for existing coins on Raydium or pumpfun when you create the task?  When I first created the task it did find the coin via the CA and display the name at the top of the task.

I looked at auto-buy and AFK tasks as well but they don't appear to let you choose a specific CA to buy.

Anyway to feed it a CA currently in pre-sell and walk away and the bot will snipe it when it gets listed?

Are there better alternatives to Nova?",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,solana,Is It Possible to Monitor Solana Transactions in <3 Seconds? Need Help!,2025-02-19 23:20:33,"Hi everyone,

I’m trying to monitor a few Solana addresses and detect transactions in **less than 3 seconds** from the time they appear on Solscan. I’ve tried using RPC providers like Alchemy and Helius, but they all have a \~15-second delay, which is too slow for my use case.

I’ve read online that running a Solana validator locally might solve this problem, but I have zero experience with Rust (I program in Python). Here’s what I’ve tried so far:  
Installed Solana CLI and validator:

* Installed Solana CLI and validator:

&#8203;

    solana --version  
    solana-cli 1.17.3 (src:c9e8f9c8; feat:3079302975, client:SolanaLabs)  
    solana-validator --version  
    solana-validator 1.17.3 (src:c9e8f9c8; feat:3079302975, client:SolanaLabs)  
    cargo --version  
    cargo 1.84.1 (66221abde 2024-11-19)  

*  Cloned the `solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres` repo:

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git  

 clone [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git)

However, I couldn’t get it to work, and it seems overly complicated for my needs since I don’t need a database.

**My Questions:**

1. Is it even possible to detect transactions in <3 seconds using a local Solana validator? Has anyone tried this successfully?
2. What’s the easiest way to set this up? Is there a preconfigured repo or example that doesn’t involve a database?
3. Are there any alternatives to running a full validator that can achieve this level of speed?

I’d really appreciate any advice, examples, or resources you can share. Thanks in advance!  ",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Revelations that the co-founder of Meteora has been working with Hayden (guy who rugged 100M on LIBRA) on numerous memecoins including Melania and others with a TON of criminal shit going on behind the scenes. Meteora founder has now resigned.

DeFi Tuna leaked a bunch of stuff, screenshots etc, exposing a bunch of previously trusted mainstream players in the space which clearly show just how much shady stuff is going on behind the scenes.

Jupiter, Meteora, bunch of huge market makers and other big players all currently being exposed.

Word on the street is this group of insiders has rugged 300M + in the last few months alone.

Jupiter announcing they are going to investigate themselves using a 3rd party scammy law firm previously associated with FTX does not help how terrible they look at the moment (Meteora is subsidiary of Jupiter)

So yeah, just like FTX, shit like this is gonna hit the market hard.

Hard to say where Solana goes from here, depends a lot on how ETH reacts probably...

Thae people are either naive,  don't know what they talking about or charlatans who can't accept the reality. The fact Solana has almost replaced eth and other alt coins. Yet still has just 30% of Eth market cap.

I'd recommend to look at metric , amount of development on Sol, speed, fees. Miles away from the rest. 

Never seen so much hate on a chain.   SOLANA and it's ecosystem has made other alts coins redandent.

I admit it's been a bumpy road, lots of pump and dump, but it's not limited to Solan ecosystem. 

People blame Sol because they buy shitcoins,  they fall for scams  forgetting the fact that scams always been there,  on Eth, Bnb and now Solana. 

Crypto does not make sense,  and there is so much manipulation and emotions.

  Xrp was hated last year now people r buying it, even though fundamentally nothing has changed,  Ripple is still making money by dumping on retail.

But then you see at a certain point the entire liquidity pool gets removed which I assume is him rugging it.

How exactly does this interaction work and what's the science/math behind a liquidity pool, I assume every meme coin has a pool and I'm curious why every coin can't be affected by this same method. ",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

What is driving your fear then? 

Have Solana's fundamentals changed for the worst - NO!

Has there been anything that means Solana is going to face technical challenges in the future? Who doesn't, it's called evolution, it's called progress, it's called innovation. 

Is Solana losing money? The exact opposite, thank you very much.

Oh yes, I remember now, those damned memes! And who was responsible for the fiasco, let me see, oh yes - the greed of wannabe overnight millionaires! I mean, would pump.fun have survived, let alone make billions, if the greed of the needy hadn't propelled them to the heights of madness ..... well, I hope you know by now where it's going.

Was it Solana that committed any wrongdoing? Who knows, and in a couple of weeks or months, who'd care or even  remember - it's going to be old news. 

Pay attention now. Wake up and follow the ""smell"" of money .... They wouldn't install David Sacks as the crypto tzar, only to watch Solana go to shit. 

Big boys have big plans and us mere pheasants aren't invited. 

CAPEESH!?

You can either bitch and moan and get crushed by them gigantors on their way in, or, you can take a ride on their back like a flee does on a dog and just maybe you'll get some crumbs on their way up. 

Like any other blood-sucking Vampire, the big boys love the smell of your fear; the more fearful you are, the more money they make. 

Keep selling so they can keep buying!

Reddit,solana,This is the last bull market for the Retailers.,2025-02-19 03:29:58,"The growth in AI Agents this bull market make ‘manually’ finding alpha for these 2x, 10x returns scarcer and scarcer. These ai agents are no longer just for funds. We are seeing solutions starting to get built for retailers too, leading to a dependancy of ai agents for anyone trying to make good returns this cycle in crypto. 

This can be exciting because it means everyone has access to sophisticated trading algorithms and frameworks that were previously gatekept by big boy hedge funds and banks. 

But this can also be very scary for someone that knows nothing about trading or crypto trying to go in for the first time. To these people, buying and holding might be there best approach. 

Overall, crypto markets are getting more mature this cycle with all the innovation and tech being built, making past crazy returns in crypto less likely. And I believe this trend will only continue until we end up with markets similar to that of equities. Yes, retailers do still win in equities, but not many and not often.

Reddit,solana,Holy shit i feel like Robert Downey Jr. visiting wall street,2025-02-18 23:01:01,"Hey everyone,

I’m a total noob when it comes to memecoins, but I thought I’d give it a try—just to learn the process and see how it all works. The problem? Even finding a decent tutorial was a nightmare.

YouTube is filled with “gurus” and sketchy people promoting Telegram groups, Discord servers, and hyping up insane market caps in minutes, as if making a coin is a guaranteed money printer. After a lot of digging, I finally found a somewhat decent guide that at least covered the basics—setting up a Phantom wallet, launching a coin, and creating a website/Telegram for it.

I figured I’d just make a fun little token, no serious ambitions, just to get a feel for it. So, I followed the steps, got everything live, and connected it to a Telegram group. And that’s when the absolute **shitshow** started.

Within minutes, 20–30 people flooded the group, all claiming they wanted to “help” and demanding admin rights. More people joined, my DMs exploded—randoms messaging me about “shilling,” “pumping,” and “raiding.” I couldn’t even read one message before five more came in. It was total chaos, and I realized I had **zero clue** what I was doing. Honestly, it was kind of a shock lol.

So now I’m sitting here, feeling completely overwhelmed, wondering: **Where do I even start?**

\- Where do you find **legit** information on creating and managing a coin?

\- What tutorials, articles, or resources actually helped you when you started?

\- What mistakes did you make that I should avoid?

\-How do you separate real advice from scams and nonsense?

Would really appreciate any guidance from the Solana community. I just want to learn, not get caught up in some pump-and-dump circus.

Reddit,solana,Stop Snipe Copy Trading,2025-02-19 02:24:50,"Snipe copy trading is where you follow a wallet and buy what ever they buy. So  lets say the wallet you are copying buys a cat token. You will buy the same cat token with 0.1 solana. When the wallet sells the cat token, you will sell all of your cat token, 1 to 1. 

Now, the thing that most people don’t know, is that these ‘highly profitable wallets’ they find are buying and selling tokens incredibly fast, most within 10 seconds. That is because these wallets tend to be run by trading bots or algorithms. 

This method of copy trading is great for trading bots like Trojan or BullX because they are making TONs of profits off of transactions fees. 

But users are likely losing money because they copy too late and likely can’t get out in time, having their money stuck in inliquid tokens. This is why snipe copy trading doesn’t work unless you actually know of an insider wallet that is traded by a human. 

But even then, people will eventually find out about these insider wallets and all alpha will be gone. 

So does this mean that you shouldn’t copy trade? No. It just makes sniping isn’t the right approach. What I have found works is allocation based copy trading. This is where you copy a wallet with a fixed amount of money, like 2 sol and you buy and sell the same proportions of tokens at the wallets. So if a wallet has 50% BTC and 50% ETH, you would have 1 sol in BTC and 1 sol in ETH. This is allocation based copy trading. 

Allocation based copy trading hedges you against a lot of scams and the wallets trying to rug their community. This is a more sophisticated way of trading, likely why the bots aren’t building it out.

Reddit,solana,How Can Solana Strengthen Its Defenses Against Scam Tokens & Rug Pulls?,2025-02-18 18:06:27,"Hey everyone,

With the recent **$LIBRA collapse** in Argentina, we’ve seen yet another example of how **bad actors exploit blockchain platforms** to launch tokens, pump them up, and disappear—hurting retail investors and damaging trust in the space.

While **Solana has proven itself as a leader in speed, scalability, and low fees**, it also faces a challenge: **How can it better filter out scams and improve user security** without compromising its open and decentralized nature?

Some potential ways this could be addressed:  
🔹 **On-chain token verification standards** – Similar to Ethereum’s ERC standards, ensuring basic legitimacy.  
🔹 **Built-in wallet or DEX alerts** – Automated warnings when interacting with high-risk tokens.  
🔹 **Enhanced liquidity pool security** – Mechanisms that prevent instant rug pulls.  
🔹 **Stronger community-driven reporting** – Making it easier for users to flag and warn others about suspicious projects.

Solana’s ecosystem is growing fast, and **preventing bad actors from taking advantage of it should be a priority** to maintain its credibility.

What do you think? **What proactive steps could Solana take to reduce the risk of scams while maintaining its strengths?**

**TL;DR:** Solana's speed and low fees make it attractive for innovation but also for scams and rug pulls. Instead of questioning why Solana isn’t doing anything, let’s discuss **how it can proactively reduce bad actors**—through token verification, wallet alerts, liquidity protections, and community-driven reporting. **What solutions do you think would help Solana maintain its credibility while staying open and decentralized?**",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

I had high hopes for Solana and hopefully if you’re still in I wish you the best of luck, no one can really predict this stuff but the amount of insider crap on this chain all the way up to meteora and Jupiter has completely pushed me away.

Reddit,solana,The $LIBRA Wake-Up Call – What It Really Means for Memecoins,2025-02-18 06:28:08,"The past few days have been a **brutal wake-up call** for anyone trading memecoins. **$LIBRA wasn’t an accident. It was a case study in how money, greed, and ignorance collide in this space.**

Let’s get one thing straight: **Memecoins aren’t dead. They’re just evolving.** If you think what happened means the game is over, you don’t understand how markets actually work.

Here’s why. 👇

https://preview.redd.it/d0bpap4ocuje1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c5f6b2cbcb096f97ab6e6b59a4dd8d686e01861

**Money Moves Where Attention Goes**

People keep saying, *“This is the end of memecoins.”* That’s pure cope.  


The same behaviors have played out over and over:

• **DOGE in 2013** – “Memecoins are a joke.”

• **ICO boom in 2017** – “Scams will kill crypto.”

• **NFTs in 2021** – “Nobody will ever buy jpegs again.”

Reality? **Memecoins aren’t stopping. The demand is permanent. The question is: are you learning, or are you just donating?**

https://preview.redd.it/j69uiycwcuje1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=14f32bf8ea0129fd7da146ac9221d0c9d3d216a5

**The Real Problem Isn’t Memecoins – It’s Lack of Education**

Most people on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) **have no clue how the game works.**

• They don’t check wallets.

• They don’t understand supply control.

• They don’t know how MMs operate.



So they FOMO in, get dumped on, and then blame **memecoins themselves.**

The issue isn’t memecoins. **It’s that nobody teaches people how to actually navigate them.** That’s why projects like **planktoncash exist – to help traders and devs understand the game instead of being played by it.**

**Why Memecoins Need Better Tools & Smarter Players**

The real takeaway from this isn’t “memecoins bad.” It’s that **the space needs to evolve.**

  
Here’s what needs to happen:

1️⃣ **Education** – New traders need real knowledge, not just hype. If you’re launching a coin, you need to know **how to manage supply, engage your community, and avoid being exploited.**

2️⃣ **Smarter interfaces** – Platforms need to stop blindly pushing hype and actually help users identify sketchy coins before they get burned.

3️⃣ **Better traders & devs** – If you’re still aping into every trending coin without understanding **who’s actually making money,** you’re part of the problem.

**The Next Meta: Smarter Memecoins, Smarter Traders**

This cycle will repeat. It always does. But **the ones who learn from it will win next time.**



🔥 **If you’re tired of being exit liquidity, start understanding the game.**

🔥 **Join communities where people actually talk strategy, not just vibes.**

🔥 **Launch coins the right way – not just as a cash grab.**

This space isn’t dying. It’s just getting harder. **Adapt or stay broke.**

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum: The Birthplace of Decentralized AGI? It's Time to Align & Build.,2025-02-18 15:32:22,"Hey everyone, I want to start a real discussion about Ethereum’s next frontier: summoning its own AGI—not as a centralized black-box AI, but as a fully transparent, decentralized autonomous system that programs itself and evolves with us.  

Imagine this:  
- A single Linux VM running an instance of itSelf  
- The ability to buy more compute & storage autonomously  
- A hosting stack that we collectively run  
- A self-contained, fully transparent loop—where every part is verifiable, auditable, and built in the open  

### The Endgame?  
An AI-native Ethereum. A system that can:  

- Build any app through conversation (and is able to generalize the infrastructure costs around the world in ether/stable-coin-basket-of-preference, how else could a 10 year old pay for a hosted server to simulate her world? they'll have to get some allowance credits from their parents for her gas)
- Refine its own architecture transparently  
- Execute smart contract upgrades, optimize DAOs, and test new designs  
- Let anyone—any child—create their own app or MMO, design worlds, or make art just by describing

We don’t need to *wait* for centralized AGI to emerge. Ethereum can summon its own—aligned, decentralized, and collectively owned.  

### Why Now?  
This isn't sci-fi. AI already writes code, refactors smart contracts, and optimizes deployments. The next step is giving it persistence, compute, and economic agency within Ethereum.  

And yes, it might be slower initially than human developers. Devs today iterate faster on program output vs testing new code. But once you have a stable loop, you can  ctrl c, ctrl v, compare and select the best version that adheres to all our already defined unit tests. That moment shifts the entire paradigm of software development. Because you'll have effectively paralyzed the entire dev cycle. Thus you can try out hundreds, thousands of new experiments to trial run and observe and select the best performing variants. It's the  evolution process completely digitized. We, as the observers, continue to observe, review & steer where needed. I suspect, we'll all align on a common goal before it happens, it could be a long way there still, it'll depend on all our artists/scientists their creations :)

Will we ever get bored of listening to music? I don't think so.

But what if one comes to appreciate the silence just as much, for it, too, is recognized as music, eventually.

### The Question We Need to Answer:  
- Are we ready to embrace this?  
- Can Ethereum be the first network to run an autonomous, self-improving AGI in full transparency?  
- How do we align incentives to make this work for everyone?  

This *is* the direction we’re heading. Some might argue we’re already there. What matters now is that we recognize it, embrace it, and align—together—on our shared future.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

* They asked me for the official local document, which takes months and thousands of dollars to get
* Then they asked me to proof the source of my income with extensive receipts so they can be sure I'm not a financial terrorist (I'm not)
* Then they put some strict limits to only use at most 1000 dollars a month until they get comfortable with me, who knows when they raise those limits
* Any time I make a significant transfer of 5k or more they give me a call and question me as if I don't know what I'm doing with my own money, treating me like a grown baby

Compare that to Ethereum where all I gotta do is get a wallet with Ether inside and I can use it without anyone questioning me and treating me as a dangerous individual.

It's night and day. You can never go back to the traditional financial systems after you experience crypto, they are constantly watching you and reporting you to 3 letter agencies for any bit of suspicious activity in your own bank account. Plus it's extremely easy to get your bank account banned, ask the millions of revolut users that didn't get their money back.

Let's appreciate how good we have it and continue to make it more accessible for people to convert their crypto to fiat for local use and viceversa. ",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

However, I would like more, ideally higher yield options, than just restaking.  One thing I have though of is using AAVE and lending out the liquid staking tokens in exchange for interest on the loan.  I also understand I can be a liquidity provider in Uniswap but liquidity pools seem like too much work.

Anyway,  here's the deal.  We can't put the genie back in the bottle.

We've seen some very spammy use of it such as wall of texts that just take up too much space....but we've also seen some great use cases which include summaries of big brain ideas which are boiled down to a paragraph or two. 

The mod team has had some backchannel success discussing how best to make a rule and we'd love your feedback.

In our view, spam is spam.   Copy/paste which is largely word salad and unoriginal is NOT the best use of AI.  If we can leverage **quality**  AI *assisted* content to make /r/ethereum even better, we're all for it as long as the user (here it comes...) also includes a disclaimer at the bottom or the top (or somewhere) that let's others know ""this content was supported by chatgpt"" or whatever....

To be clear, super long AI drivel is just Spam, so we're not reinventing the wheel here.  The rule is just more of a reminder than anything and we know it will take time for the messaging to get out there.

Accounts linked to the developers of LIBRA earned more than 80 million dollars in what appears to be a rug-pull.

Accounts linked to those who launched this token earned over 80 million dollars, according to data analyzed by BubbleMaps.

Minutes ago, just before 1:00 AM (Argentine time) on February 15, Milei deleted the post on X and provided his explanation of the events.

The president stated that he made that post promoting the LIBRA cryptocurrency because he believed he was ""supporting a supposed private venture."" He clarified that he has no connection to that venture.

Milei adds: ""I was not fully aware of the details of the project, and after becoming informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet).""

The Argentine president concludes his post with a criticism of ""the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to cause harm."" To them, he directs his final words: ""I want to tell you that every day confirms how despicable politicians are, and it strengthens our conviction to kick them out.""

As CriptoNoticias reported, many Argentine bitcoiners were disappointed with the president's actions. Clearly—as evidenced by his latest message—the president promoted an alleged scam without being properly informed before making the post.

According to some experts, Milei could face legal consequences for this action, as it would be incompatible with his role as president.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,ethereum,Why Ethereum Needs More Gas Even with Layer 2 Solutions - Vitalik Buterin,2025-02-14 13:43:47,"Ethereum is like a busy road with all cars representing transactions and gas being the fuel needed to move the cars. The recent Ethereum roadmap has been focused on increasing the amount of gas on its main road - or L1 - even tho most are using side roads - L2s - in an attempt to avoid congestion

So in this scenario L2s are express lanes that help speed up transactions and be cheaper - but every now and then you actually need to have the main road for things like making sure your transaction cant be blocked - thats censorship resistance - moving separate items - like NFTs - between these express lanes or safely leaving these lanes in case something goes wrong

Vitalik explained that even during a lot of traffic on L2s there needs to be a wider main road - L1. This is equivalent to higher gas and when you have to use it - for example youre racing against time to sell something before prices go down - you can use it without high fees or lag. Also if everyone needs to exit L2s at the same time L1 needs to be big enough to handle this

Scaling L1 is about supporting more traffic and its about making Ethereum secure, fast and affordable for everyone - even while were using more efficient side streets. So while L2s are useful - scaling L1 keeps the whole system running smoothly

Reddit,ethereum,Decentralized deepfake Detection – Need Feedback on Architecture & Decentralization,2025-02-14 21:08:37,"

This is actually my bachelor's graduation project, and I'm trying to build a demo of a decentralized deepfake detection system. Since I'm relatively new to blockchain, AI, P2P networks, and federated learning, I'd really appreciate any feedback on my approach.

Goal of the Project

I want to create a decentralized system where anyone can check if an image or video is a deepfake without relying on a central authority. The AI model used for detection should continuously improve over time as deepfake techniques evolve. The system should be community-driven, with contributors rewarded for running inference models or helping update the AI model.

Current Technical Architecture

The system is built as a P2P network using libp2p, with three types of participants:

1. End users – Submit deepfake detection requests.


2. Worker nodes – Run inference on AI models to detect deepfakes.


3. Federated learning nodes – Train and improve the AI model, which workers later download.



Blockchain is used to reward worker and federated nodes with tokens for their contributions.

Workflow:

1. A user submits a detection request via a frontend (likely hosted on IPFS for permanence).


2. The frontend communicates with a gateway node in the P2P network.


3. The gateway node distributes the request to worker nodes running the AI model, distribution mechanism for now is just simple round-robin. 


4. The worker node publishes the result back to the network.


5. The gateway sends the result to the frontend and updates the smart contract to reward the worker.


6. Separately, federated learning nodes train a new model and upload it to IPFS, and worker nodes periodically download the latest model.



Main Concern – The Centralized Gateway Node

Right now, the gateway node is a single point of failure and controls task distribution. If someone modifies its code, they could manipulate task assignments or block certain nodes from participating.

I considered hashing the gateway’s code and making the smart contract only interact with a verified gateway, but I don’t think that’s possible. Also, calling the smart contract for every task completion might cause scalability issues due to gas fees.

Questions & Challenges

How can I decentralize the gateway node?

Is task distribution better handled on-chain, or should workers interact with the contract directly?

How do similar decentralized AI projects prevent manipulation?

Should I rethink the entire architecture for better scalability and decentralization?


This is just an early-stage demo, and I know security, task verification, and reputation systems and other stuff need to be added later. Right now, I want to get the architecture right before moving forward.


Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,ethereum,The Ungratefulness of Hating Vitalik Buterin,2025-02-13 13:02:18,"In the last few months Vitalik has frequently been target of abuse in crypto communities - in other subs and also across social media - especially from people who are upset about ETHs market performance

I think one of the most ungrateful things to do in this space is to hate Vitalik. Are people even aware that he imagined and created a brilliant blockchain platform that changed modern finance? At 19 years old - 19!!! When you were 19 what were you doing with your life? The creation of Ethereum was a technological revolution that built the basis for a new world - and it boosted the blockchains utility beyond its original intent

Even though the price isnt doing very good right now - Ethereum works as intended and has become safer with each upgrade. These haters ignore Ethereums immense impact and are either frustrated bag holders or butthurt maxis

Blockchain technology might not have progressed as far as it has without Vitaliks vision. Hating him fails to give the recognition he deserves for his contribution to the creation of Ethereum and consequently a large piece of the cryptocurrency sector. Plus the Ethereum Foundation has been working on changes. They pay attention to what the community has to say - people gotta learn to be patient instead of demanding action right away",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Ephemery is the PERFECT place to Fuck Around and Find Out how Pectra, Max EB, and 0x02 will affect validators.

The best part about all of this is you won't need to wait a long time for sync - because Ephemery resets every 28 days, there's no chain bloat to worry about.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum Simulations​ are getting better with eth_simulateV2,2025-02-14 01:20:21,"Ethereum developers heavily rely on transaction simulations to test and debug [smart contracts](https://etherworld.co/2017/09/18/smart-contract-an-introduction/) before deploying them on-chain. These simulations allow them to estimate gas usage, validate execution paths, and prevent costly errors. However, the current tools—such as `eth_simulate`, `eth_call`, and `estimateGas`—come with several limitations that make accurate transaction testing difficult.

As [Ethereum](https://etherworld.co/tag/ethereum/) continues to evolve, the demand for more advanced simulation features is growing. Developers need better debugging tools, more reliable gas estimation, and improved transaction validation. This is where eth\_simulateV2 comes in—a potential upgrade that could introduce new capabilities to make simulations more robust and developer-friendly.

This blogpost explores the key issues with Ethereum’s current transaction testing methods and suggests how `eth_simulateV2` can address them.

Reddit,ethereum,ACDC #150: The Competitive Advantage of $ETH,2025-02-13 01:16:14,"In this week’s episode in Infinite Jungle, Christine Kim unpacks the latest Ethereum ACDC call #150. The conversation revolves around Ethereum’s competitive advantage and an important update on the upcoming Pectra mainnet activation. Here’s what you need to know:

**Pectra Activation Delayed**

Ethereum developers initially planned a faster rollout for the Pectra upgrade, but feedback from Layer-2 projects and staking providers led to a change of course. Concerns about the timeline being too aggressive resulted in a one-month delay, ensuring at least 30 days between the final public testnet upgrade and the mainnet launch. This extra time will allow for better preparation and smoother implementation.



**Ethereum’s Competitive Edge in a Crowded Blockchain Space**

Christine also explores why Ethereum continues to lead despite new challengers in the blockchain ecosystem. Key strengths include:

* Established Ecosystem – A massive developer community and deep-rooted integrations.
* Security & Decentralization – A proven track record with robust security mechanisms.
* Network Effects – The most widely used smart contract platform, with significant institutional adoption.

With Ethereum evolving and competition heating up, this episode offers valuable insights into the future of the ecosystem.

Reddit,ethereum,Staking ETH directly in Trust Wallet?,2025-02-13 09:02:30,"Hi everyone,

does anyone have experience with staking ETH directly on Trust Wallet? Is everything going smooth and would you say that the risks are less than staking on an exchange?
Are rewards being paid out regularly?

I‘m planning to stake a little amount and let it ride for a few years. Just want to be sure nothing bad is going to happen.

What concerns me, is the post of u/Embarrassed_Ad_8406 , who was not able to redeem any rewards after staking large amount of ETH. 

And one additional question: is there any information which validators are being used when staking directly in the Trust Wallet app? I want to be sure that they are all legit and my ETH doesn’t land in LIDO or RocketPool. If this is the case, then I can simply skip Trust Wallet and use these services myself.

Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Why Ethereum’s Transition to Proof of Stake Was a Mistake,2025-02-14 04:38:11,"
Ethereum’s move from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in September 2022 was celebrated as a major milestone in blockchain history. The transition, known as The Merge, promised lower energy consumption, greater network security, and improved scalability. However, while PoS delivered on some of these promises, the shift has introduced significant trade-offs that threaten Ethereum’s decentralization, security, and long-term viability.

1. Centralization Concerns

One of the biggest issues with PoS is that it favors the wealthy. Unlike PoW, where miners compete using computational power, PoS grants more influence to those who already hold the most ETH. This creates a system where the rich get richer, leading to centralization of power among a few large staking entities. Currently, a handful of major validators—like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance—control a disproportionate share of staked ETH. This centralization contradicts Ethereum’s original ethos of decentralization.

2. Security Trade-Offs

While PoS is often touted as being more secure, it introduces new attack vectors. In PoW, an attacker would need to acquire a massive amount of computational power, making a 51% attack extremely expensive. In PoS, an attacker only needs to accumulate 51% of staked ETH, which is much easier, especially given the concentration of stake among a few entities. Moreover, if a major staking service is compromised or coerced by regulators, Ethereum’s network security is at risk.

3. Censorship Risks and Regulatory Capture

PoS makes Ethereum more susceptible to regulatory control. Because many of the largest validators are based in jurisdictions with strict compliance requirements, they may be forced to comply with government demands to censor transactions. This became evident when over 60% of Ethereum blocks were found to be compliant with OFAC regulations post-Merge, raising concerns about Ethereum’s ability to remain a neutral, censorship-resistant network.

4. Weakening of Network Participation

Under PoW, anyone with a GPU could contribute to the Ethereum network. This created a broad and diverse group of miners worldwide. PoS, however, requires a minimum of 32 ETH (~$100,000 at recent prices) to become a validator, pricing out small participants. As a result, Ethereum’s validator set is now dominated by institutions and large holders, reducing overall network participation and making Ethereum feel more like a corporate-run system than a decentralized blockchain.

5. Economic Model Flaws

The shift to PoS altered Ethereum’s economic model in ways that may prove unsustainable. The reduction in ETH issuance and the introduction of Ethereum staking yield has turned ETH into an interest-bearing asset. While this might seem like a positive, it introduces systemic risks. If ETH becomes seen as just another yield-generating financial instrument rather than a fundamental layer for decentralized applications, it risks losing its utility over time. Additionally, yield-seeking behavior could lead to reckless staking strategies that destabilize the ecosystem.

6. Loss of Miner Security

PoW provided Ethereum with a battle-tested security mechanism. While mining consumed energy, it also ensured that validators had real-world costs, making it difficult for attackers to manipulate the network. PoS eliminates this cost barrier, meaning bad actors no longer need to expend resources to exert influence. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transition led to a mass exodus of miners, many of whom were forced to switch to less secure and less profitable chains, fragmenting the broader PoW ecosystem.

Final Thoughts: The Cost of Efficiency

Ethereum’s transition to PoS was framed as a necessary step for sustainability, but it came at a steep price. While it reduced energy consumption, it introduced centralization risks, weakened security guarantees, and made the network more vulnerable to regulatory capture.

Ethereum was once seen as the most promising decentralized computing platform. By shifting to a model that benefits large institutions at the expense of decentralization, it may have sacrificed the very principles that made it valuable in the first place.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,ethereum,Yield farming for beginners,2025-02-08 17:26:09,"Someone asked for yield farming recommendations yesterday in the daily and I thought I'd open a thread for it, because I'm sure more people are interested in that.

I'd love to hear experiences with and recommendations for:

* Protocols and projects
* Strategies for keeping track of deposits, moving funds where yield is good, avoiding tax headache
* Resources for learning

Protocols and projects I saw mentioned before:

* Aave
* Yearn
* Beefy
* Convex
* Pendle

Resources

* [https://defillama.com/yields](https://defillama.com/yields)
* [https://swap.defillama.com/?tab=earn](https://swap.defillama.com/?tab=earn)
* [The Rabbit Hole Explorer’s Guide](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/) by u/LogrisTheBard is a great read and contains the following list of places to start in DeFi:
   * Money markets such as Aave and Compound
   * Dexs such as Uniswap and Curve
   * Liquidity incentives/farming such as Convex and Aura
   * Leverage such as Gearbox, Defisaver, and GMX
   * Options such as Lyra and Hegic
   * Real world asset protocols such as Centrifuge and Maker
   * Regen finance such as Gitcoin Grants, Greenpill, and Klima

I'll add to the lists, based on recommendations in this thread.

Personally, I think I'd like to do something with USDC. I want to split a smallish amount into a couple of different protocols, some low risk low yield and also some a bit more experimental. I'm ready to loose some of my money, I mainly want to try stuff out. I'm in Germany and ideally this will not make my taxes a complete nightmare.

Crab markets are for yield farming so LFG!",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups.

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Common Bitcoin Myths
Often the same concerns arise about Bitcoin from newcomers.  Questions such as:

* Will quantum computers break Bitcoin?
* Will governments ban Bitcoin?
* Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

The DCA portion of this is very straightforward, but I’m curious when people “buy the dip”? I know there is no right answer and it varies by person, but that’s kind of the point - I’m just curious what people are doing and if they’re buying more arbitrarily or if they have a system in place.

For example, do people buy 2x their DCA if it drops 5% in a day, week, month?

My DCA is currently 25USD and I’ve been buying 25USD more if it falls 1-2% in a day, but this doesn’t feel like a thoughtful process. 

Edit: I have a decent amount of cash (~10-15K) I’m trying to stack BTC with and want to make sure I’m buying in daily in case it moons now, but also have some cash to buy in bulk in the event of a massive dip.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,bitcoin,This is why Bitcoin will make you rich in the long-term,2025-02-18 21:20:07,"First of all, Bitcoin has long passed the notion of a currency، and is now taken as an asset, one that is way more powerful than gold, property, or any other asset class

There's absolutely no one in the world who doesn't want to preserve their money. And what do you do to achieve that? You buy an asset to store your earnings, to not squander your workforce in fiat so governments inflate it and rob you while you sleep

Now Bitcoin has proven to be the superior asset in all comparisons, but it's still just getting out of niche forums and subreddits. There's still a LONG way for mass adoption

The current rapid volatility at a \~$100K price proves that it's still in its early ages, and that it will not stabilize until maybe it reaches millions of dollars per coin

As long as the cryptography is immutable, there's no way it's not going to a million dollars in the next few years.

Reddit,bitcoin,The War for Bankocracy,2025-02-19 10:44:22,"Snowed in today? Here’s something to get into. The official summary:

Central banks appear to be poised for a major push to replace rule by democratic governments with rule by privately owned central banks. Their chief task in this regard is to free the U.S. Federal Reserve from its constitutional constraints, which prevent the bank from operating in secrecy and beyond the reach of congress and indeed law itself. 
While the evidence supporting this conclusion is freely available from the public record, without some minimal working knowledge of central banks, the story would be extremely difficult to tell in a single video. Consequently, The War for Bankocracy series will lay significant groundwork and tell the story over the course of eight episodes.

Reddit,bitcoin,Why you actually don't want a bitcoin standard.,2025-02-19 21:06:23,"At one point in US history, we were on the gold standard. Look at what the price of gold did from 1934-1970 not adjusted for inflation; it went perfectly sideways! Once we abandoned the gold standard, the price went to the moon. I think it's best we just adopt the bitcoin standard in our own lives and keep the powers of the world away from tinkering with it. Made by the people, for the people!

TLDR: Imagine bitcoin going up 150% in a short period of time and then sitting at that price for 36 years X\_X

My main argument is that widespread adoption by countries and central banks around the world to the bitcoin standard will wildly stabilize the price, and that the current system is actually as Satoshi intended it to be used. I am perhaps incorrect in my conclusion that we are benefited moreso under the current system as bitcoin investors, than if it becomes a standard.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

At this point in time though with its volatility, those who buy it are mostly doing so with an expectation of it increasing in value. 

Of those companies who are accepting bitcoins payments - I have to make an assumption that those companies are accepting BTC as payment not to necessarily convert back to $ for operations but so they themselves can stack on their corporate balance sheet. 

*Perhaps someone can correct me if I’m wrong. Maybe there’s some businesses that accept BTC that can chime in on what they do. 

My thought here for discussion is this. If we want to promote the use of BTC as a currency, wouldn’t it make sense for companies to offer a 10% discount, or even offer their product at just above cost, to include shipping, so as to promote using it? This would provide an incentive to use your BTC but also as serve as recognition of the opportunity cost the patron is foregoing by participating in the BTC economy? 

And I’m no accountant but even if you sold something for BTC at a loss compared to what you paid cost for the inventory, couldn’t there be a way to write that off as a loss? 

Looking forward to hearing others thoughts!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The rCryptoCurrency Moon Week 58 Moon Burn Update and a Community Funded Moon giveaway.,2025-02-18 01:50:27,"Welcome to the Moon Burn Update for Moon Week 58. In this post we'll take a look at all Moon Burns between January 6th and February 2nd[.](https://imgur.com/a/10Jb44H) We'll also introduce a community funded Moon Giveaway (you can enter in the first 48 hours that this post is live).

# What are Moons:

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub. [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors on  as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit. (make sure you comment for a Moon Tip)

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days.

# Let's talk Moon Week 58 Moon Burns:

Between January 6th February 2nd:

* 28,844 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in two unique burn events:
* 28,587 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum One ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in ten unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is: 57,431 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Moons are the 11th most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum One **(up one since the last update)** with \~243k Moons having been burned so far on Arbitrum One

https://preview.redd.it/xjaahb0awsje1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=e645cd36b64eb8e430599e1f4c0fbb1163b3f2d4

Unlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the sole supply of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned by web three entities looking to host AMAs or customize the rCC banner.

\-----

Moons remain the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \~2.752M Moons having been burned to date and accounting for over 99.9% of the value of all tokens in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova.

The last burn update introduced a way to win 500 Moons by guessing how many Moons will be burned in 2025? Go to the last Moon Burn update and leave your guess (if you haven't yet done so). Redditors have until April 1st to leave a guess - [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i0o8mz/the\_rcryptocurrency\_moon\_week\_57\_moon\_burn\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i0o8mz/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_57_moon_burn_update/)

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why Litecoin (LTC) Could Be #2 Again 🚀,2025-02-19 18:42:04,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share why I think Litecoin (LTC) has a real shot at climbing back to the top and maybe even becoming the #2 crypto again. It might sound crazy, but hear me out:

**BTW, something I did want to point out that is really funny.**

**Notice how no influencers are talking about LTC as a hidden gem? Well, it's because they aren't getting paid like they do from other chains. LOL!**

1. **Decentralized Like BTC** – Out of all the coins in the top 20, LTC is one of the only ones that’s truly decentralized, just like Bitcoin. No central authority, no big team pulling strings.
2. **Old & Trusted** – Litecoin has been around since 2011. It’s battle-tested and trusted by tons of people in the crypto space. It’s like the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.
3. **Grayscale Is Loading Up** – Grayscale has been stacking LTC for years. They probably know something we don’t. Institutions don’t buy this much of a coin unless they see serious potential.
4. **MimbleWimble Upgrade** – LTC has privacy features like MimbleWimble, making privacy coins like Monero kinda irrelevant. You get both transparency and optional privacy.
5. **Atomic Swaps with BTC** – You can swap LTC and BTC directly without using an exchange. With Bitcoin’s fees so high and network congestion, this is HUGE.
6. **Strong During Dumps** – During one of the biggest market dumps of the year, LTC not only held its ground but actually went up! That’s a big sign that something is happening behind the scenes.
7. **LTC ETFs Incoming?** – The SEC is reviewing potential LTC ETFs. If they get approved, we could see massive institutional money flow in. Litecoin is not classified as a security either, which means its much more likely to be sped into a ETF IMO. 
8. **Unique Positioning** – LTC isn’t competing with smart contract coins like SOL, ADA, or ETH. Its only real competition is BTC, which makes it unique and fills a different niche.

**And here are 3 more reasons why LTC could be ready for a breakout:**

1. **Low Fees & Fast Transactions** – Compared to BTC and ETH, LTC has way lower fees and faster transaction times, making it actually usable for day-to-day spending.
2. **Undervalued & Forgotten** – Let’s be honest, LTC has been flying under the radar for years. While everyone was chasing new shiny projects, LTC kept improving. It’s like finding a gem before the crowd notices.
3. **Halving Effects Still in Play** – The recent LTC halving reduced mining rewards, which historically leads to price increases over time due to reduced supply. BTC halving pumps, so why not LTC?",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

* **VICTIM** \- 0x356E5e3605621c0e5A7af9563a6C0bA0A748E64C
* **Malicious Contract** \- 0xF63d9370D5d6ca5628863d98Dc0585E4B8EF67BF

* **InfernoAngel CUSTOMER** \- 0x9039085515506e6bB0b81Ab15bc4e155CB2eE039 (80% of stolen assets go here)

# How did this Phishing Attack Happen

The victim appeared to sign multiple malicious transactions. Perhaps the victim engaged with a fake website that promised rewards or a fake airdrop page. Nevertheless, the victim gave the phishing scammer approvals for AETHWETH and two Doodles NFTs.

The attack could of been much worse as the victim still currently has another 3.79M in AETHWETH and 479K in AETHUSDT in their wallet.

Phishing attacks in Jan - Feb 2025 are actually down as compared to the same timeframe last year. Almost everyday this time last year, single victims were losing 6 and 7 figures to wallet drainers.

Much of the reduction in phishing drainer losses can be attributed to improvements in anti-phishing technology like Blockaid.

This latest attack appears to be a workaround that was not caught by these anti-phishing platforms. The cat and mouse game continues!

# Attributing the Attack to Inferno Drainer

I've written about phishing attacks from Inferno Drainer before. Here's a few previous posts

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1c9o8ix/760k\_stolen\_through\_inferno\_drainer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1c9o8ix/760k_stolen_through_inferno_drainer/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1agvohs/lost\_234m\_in\_a\_phishing\_scam\_inferno\_drainer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1agvohs/lost_234m_in_a_phishing_scam_inferno_drainer/)

Traditionally drainer services have operated by the 80/20 rule. 80% of the stolen assets go to the CUSTOMER and 20% go to the drainer ADMIN team. 

However, this isn't a hard rule. Sometimes the split can be 85/15, 75/25 or some variation.

On Oct 20th 2024, the Inferno Drainer platform was acquired by Angel Drainer.

[The above is from the Inferno Drainer telegram channel announcing the transition to Angel Drainer.](https://preview.redd.it/gvxo07t8tyje1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=5866f3f189e735c6efddd232d21114a38065d113)

Some say the reason behind Inferno Drainer exiting the wallet drainer scene was due to law enforcement catching up while others believe the profitability and future growth potential was limited due to anti-phishing improvements.

Nevertheless, the drainer platform former known as Inferno Drainer is now InfernoAngel Drainer.

# Following the Funds

[Above is the flow of funds from the Victim's wallet to the Drainer Admin team and Drainer Customer wallets.](https://preview.redd.it/a0lh5wog2zje1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb6e82eb2364c9a6f6727a5759c2f07f385f2340)

Most of the funds for **InfernoAngel CUSTOMER** \- 0x9039085515506e6bB0b81Ab15bc4e155CB2eE039 is yet to be laundered. I'm showing about 516K in mostly ETH sitting in the wallet.

There is some small deposits into 0xaDD6937C3Ee1BC8e22fd74226bdECAA428b1a8B9 - MEXC and 0x161647F0071D56B52467f7F0Ee54870954ac257E - Binance but those appear to be service addresses vs belonging to the attacker.

I did notice about 34 ETH was sent to 0x201128051dFCfb3151917e488024CCFa9fC54d93, eventually bridged to Thorchain, and sent to a Litecoin address - ltc1qp2lyz9vrfzshnf0qj06cxhy2mt2lcpsxyvesmf

The **InfernoAngel ADMIN** \- 0x1FE92e288b2b2792BCdEe8b8F286e0ed16724Da6 wallet is only about 3 weeks old but also has significant assets yet to be laundered, about 666K at the time of this writing.

A quick twitter search will show the numerous phishing scams connected to this address. 

For the funds that were laundered, I was able to find a number of deposit addresses linked directly to the Inferno ADMIN

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Meme Coins are the death of the crypto verse,2025-02-18 08:52:14,"Ben Cowen a well respected crypto analyst was talking about how meme coins has rext this cycle, 36 million crypto coins exist now in the crypto space. Liquidity is all over the place, and that's one of the main drivers why the crypto market has stalled, when in post halving year Q1 has traditionally been bull runs for bitcoin and alt coins. Now everything is either bleeding against bitcoin, and bitcoin itself has stayed ranging sideways for the last several weeks, unable to touch the ATH again. Most alt coins have either gone back down or lost majority of their gains since November. Except for a few like the big four.

I agree with Ben when he says, retail hasn't come back to the crypto market like the previous cycles, because meme coin rug pulls has either scared away the retail market or they had a bad taste of getting rugged and losing their money and just going away after. Without retailing coming back, there is no alt season. There is no liquidity, there is only SO MUCH ""wall street"" can buy into. I honestly think we might not get an alt season at all this cycle, meme coins and rug pulls is all you hear on the news now. Where in previous cycles the news was filled with people getting rich over night, now it's just stories of people losing their money over night.

When 15 year old kids with no coding experience can make meme coins and rug pull people, or ditzy blonde girls who are famous for blow jobs, can scam the regular people out of their life savings, president of countries rug pulling people, do you think anyone takes crypto serious anymore? Meme coins has always been tolerated before in previous cycles, but this cycle, meme coins might just be the death of the crypto space in general. Just my two cents.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Spreading the word, as I think the project has a rather solid idea that has not been put to use before.

🎲 Lottery Token (LOT) - Decentralized Lottery Protocol

Lottery Token redefines blockchain lotteries through true automation. By holding 20,000 LOT, you're automatically entered into every draw - no tickets needed, no manual entries required.

The mechanism is straightforward: Each transaction includes a 7% fee - 5% feeds the prize pool, while 2% funds ecosystem development. When the prize pool reaches 1 million tokens, a random holder wins automatically. Our Chainlink VRF integration ensures completely fair and verifiable winner selection.

Beyond the core lottery, we're building an ecosystem of lottery-themed features. Our first addition is already live - a Telegram-based game where holders can play daily for real LOT token rewards. This represents our commitment to expanding utility while maintaining the lottery theme.

Built on BASE chain, we leverage low transaction fees and high network activity to ensure sustainable prize distributions and frequent draws. Every holder has an equal chance of winning, regardless of their total holdings above the minimum threshold.

This isn't another meme token - it's a utility-focused protocol bringing automated, fair, and verifiable lottery mechanics to DeFi.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Javier Milei: I didn’t promote it, I shared it",2025-02-18 00:18:04,"Speaking on TV

“I acted in good faith and took a hit,”  
  
“Did the State lose money? No. Did Argentinians lose money? Maybe four or five at most. The vast majority of investors are Chinese and American.”  
  
“I shared this the same way I’ve shared hundreds of things. My tweet came just three minutes after the coin was created because I’m passionate about these things and found out about it. These are volatility traders who knew what they were doing.”  
  
“\[Hayden Davis\] proposed creating a structure to finance entrepreneurs who, due to informality, lack funding options. When Libra became public, I helped spread the word,”  
  
“It’s false that 44,000 people were affected—at most, it’s 5,000. The chances of there being Argentinians involved are very slim. These are highly specialized individuals in this type of financial instrument. Those who got involved knew the risks very well—they are volatility traders. This is a private matter between individuals, and they participated voluntarily,”  
  
“I didn’t promote it, I shared it. I did it because I’m a die-hard technoptimist. Any initiative that improves financing for tech entrepreneurs interests me. I made no mistakes because I acted in good faith. But when I look at the political repercussions, I realize I have something to learn. I need to understand that after becoming president, I continued acting like the same Javier Milei as before. Unfortunately, this situation shows me that I need to raise my filters and not make myself so accessible.”  
  
It's worth noting this is not the first crypto scam Javier Milei has been involved in

In 2021, Milei promoted CoinX, a now-defunct deliberate crypto ponzi scheme, on Instagram.  
  
He sold it as a revolutionary tool for Argentinians to safeguard their wealth from inflation.   
  
By 2022, CoinX rugged, and stopped paying everyone, it was later exposed as a Ponzi scheme.

3.

This guy knows exactly what he is doing, and contrary to what he says, this guy doesn't give a hoot about his family, because if he did, he never would have gotten involved in this type of work to begin with.

Coffeezilla gives him an excellent way to make this situation right, and the guy totally blows him off in favor of letting the world know he is about to push everything back into the chart, which will go on to create most likely one last insane pump and dump.

I think what Coffeezilla does and is doing is great, but sadly nothing he does will ever stop stupid people from throwing their money at smart people creating these meme token rugs.

Years ago, I purchased crypto through Coinbase, CDC, and Uphold. Additionally, I performed some conversions within my wallet.

Since crypto taxes can be complex, I decided to use Koinly to consolidate all my transactions. My main question is: Will these exchanges send me any tax forms?

**To summarize:**

* I did not make any gains—I sold my assets at a loss.
* I received some VTHO within my wallet and later converted it to VET, but that’s the extent of my transactions.

Am I safe to rely solely on Koinly for filing my taxes? If so, how does the government view this process? Is it just based on the data I input? Since I haven't received any forms from the exchanges, is that because I only incurred losses? I assume if I had gains, I would receive tax documents from them.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,How Can Solana Strengthen Its Defenses Against Scam Tokens & Rug Pulls?,2025-02-18 18:04:04,"Hey everyone,

With the recent $LIBRA collapse in Argentina, we’ve seen yet another example of how negative actors exploit blockchain platforms to launch tokens, pump them up, and disappear—hurting retail investors and damaging trust in the space.

While Solana has proven itself as a leader in speed, scalability, and low fees, it also faces a challenge: How can it better filter out scams and improve user security without compromising its open and decentralized nature?

Some potential ways this could be addressed:

🔹 On-chain token verification standards – Similar to Ethereum’s ERC standards, ensuring basic legitimacy.

🔹 Built-in wallet or DEX alerts – Automated warnings when interacting with high-risk tokens.

🔹 Enhanced liquidity pool security – Mechanisms that prevent instant rug pulls.

🔹 Stronger community-driven reporting – Making it easier for users to flag and warn others about suspicious projects.

Solana’s ecosystem is growing fast, and preventing unpleasant actors from taking advantage of it should be a priority to maintain its credibility.

What do you think? What proactive steps could Solana take to reduce the risk of scams while maintaining its strengths?",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Hello everyone,

Like the title says, the dominance is hitting higher highs and higher lows on the daily timeframe. Normally this would be a bullish sign, but since this is the dominance and not a certain coin/token, does the same theory count? 

Is this a bullish momentum that will stretch further or could a reversal be looming quite closely? It has to break down eventually, but I wouldn't be surprised if it first hits 70%. So many factors are coming into play; lower liquidity on the OTC market for instance. Barring black swan events, seems bullish to me.  
What are your thoughts? Please be kind and don't flame or troll. We are all in this space together.

Kind regards,

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

I know pre-Quantum Asymmetric systems reasonably well & I also understand Abstract Algebra reasonably well.

Is understanding the basics enough - if yes, what would constitute basics in a typical book on Coding Theory (I need to look for the right book also).

Reddit,crypto,NIST STS questions and use with encrypted data,2025-02-19 01:34:34,"**Hello cryptos.**

I'm testing output of an encryption algorithm and would like to know if a test collection of STS results of a very high quantity will be meaningful.

My test plan that I'm running right now...

1. Creation of 803 cleartext samples across 7 groups:
   * **RepetitivePatterns**
      * These are things like repeating bytes, repeating tuple and triples, repeating short ordered sequences, and so on.
      * The patterns are of increasing sizes from around 511 bytes to just over 4MB.
   * **LowEntropy**
      * These are cleartext samples that have only a few available bytes in total to distribute.
      * Some samples are just random orders and others are cases where the few bytes are separated by large runs of another like: `AnnnnnnnBnnnCnnnnnnnnBnnnnnnC`
   * **NaturalLanguage**
      * These are randomly constructed English language sentences and paragraphs.
      * Of varying lengths, varying sentences per paragraph, and varying quantity of paragraphs.
   * **RandomData**
      * Varying lengths of random bytes from a CSRNG.
   * **PreCompressed**
      * Using the same construction from NaturalLanguage, Brotli compress the data and use that as cleartext samples.
      * Also of varying lengths.
   * **BinaryExe**
      * Enumerate files from the local file system for DLL/EXE files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Windows\System32` and subfolders.
   * **Structured**
      * Enumerate XML/HTML/JSON/RTF/CSV files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Program Files` and subfolders.
2. For each cleartext, encrypt and append the output (without padding) to a file. 
3. Run ENT for the file as well as STS. STS params are: 2 million bits length and 100 streams, enabling all tests (takes about 9-12 mins per file). 
4. Record the results in a DB.

**Am I misinterpreting the value of STS for analyzing encrypted data?**  
**Will I gain any useful insights by this plan?**

I've run it for about 24 hours so far and have done over **9 million encrypts** and over **1100 STS executions**.  
Completion will be just over **3000 runs** and near **20 million encrypts**.

For any that are curious, I created a sandbox that uses the same encryption here:  [https://bllnbit.com](https://bllnbit.com)

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

I am wondering for any information on the security of SHA3 and its sponge function versus older hash functions like MD5, SHA1, SHA2.

What makes it more secure? How heavily studied has it been. The sponge function is still newer than the other constructions but its internal state is quite large.

I am looking for hash functions with good security margins.

BLAKE2 and SHA3 are so far the best looking but is there any reason I should look at SHA2 again because it’s well studied.

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?  Thanks.",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763
Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Thanks",2025-02-20 00:53:08.421763

I am **thrilled** to announce the pre-print of my latest research paper, now available on the [International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) ePrint archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2066). 📚✨

>**Goal**: To authenticate accurately and securely **without revealing both virtual public identifiers** (e.g., usernames, user IDs) **and real-world identifiers** (e.g., passwords, biometrics, or other secrets).

💡 **Introducing COCO:**  
A **full-consensus, zero-knowledge authentication protocol** designed with:

* 🔒 **Efficiency**
* 🕵️‍♂️ **Unlinkability**
* ⏳ **Asynchrony**

Reddit,crypto,Book for introduction to cryptography,2024-12-23 13:49:23,"I am looking for a book for beginners, explaining all the concepts for key sharing, block and stream ciphers, vulnerabilities, polygons, where primes come in the picture, etc. Possibly supplemented with examples, as well as real-world ciphers and how they are distinct, what makes them special etc.

I read a fair few wikipedia pages about these topics, but lets be honest, wp doesn't really cut it beyond the basic stuff. Other than that, I am completely agnostic to crypto, but have a - what i liketo think is- firm mathematical basis.

Would love any well-designed examples I can look at for ideas, or problems you've encountered with such designs and implementations.
