Analyst Says ‘Now Is The Time’,2025-02-08 00:30:07+00:00,"A newly released video analysis by crypto commentator asif.eth (@asifeth) makes the case that Dogecoin is currently trading at what he calls a heavily undervalued level. He offered an explanation of why he believes the coin’s ongoing correction may have just concluded—a process he interpreted through an Elliott Wave lens and, more specifically, an ABC corrective pattern. Has Dogecoin Finished Its ABC Correction? In his discussion, the analyst described how Dogecoin had exhibited a pronounced rise, after which he saw “the first A correction and after that we got a B higher high, higher low… and after that we got a C type correction.” He suggested that this final “C wave” might have drawn the token back into a crucial support region, remarking that “this could be ABC and the current correction is playing out with an RSI at oversold territory,” a condition he views as a strong buy signal. Although he acknowledged the possibility of miscounting the waves, he maintained that the structure points to a broad corrective phase that could now be nearing completion. The key price region he identified spans from around $0.24 down to $0.18, an area he repeatedly called a “very, very good” place to accumulate Dogecoin. He referred to it as a “huge supply turn to huge demand zone,” noting that the token had previously flipped this same range between support and resistance several times. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crashes 40%, But This Analyst Sees A Bullish Setup While he has confidence in the bullish significance of that zone, he outlined $0.16 as a strict cutoff below which he would exit a Dogecoin position, stating, “If in any case… you break below $0.16, you have to sell that token,” because a drop beneath that level could invalidate the entire bullish setup. His point was that continuing to hold an altcoin below such a critical support might expose traders to deeper losses if negative sentiment suddenly accelerates. He also backed up his argument by pointing to the so-called Fib golden pocket, measured from what he described as Dogecoin’s last major low in August 2024 to the subsequent price high. By overlapping that Fibonacci retracement with the same $0.24–$0.18 demand region, he found consistent evidence that the market views this band as pivotal for Dogecoin’s long-term structure. He described it as “exactly aligning with our top supply zone,” explaining that confluence like this—in combination with an oversold RSI reading—boosts the likelihood of a price rebound. Related Reading: Expert Predicts Dogecoin Price Recovery: Targeting New Heights Between $1.5 And $2 Although the analyst mentioned that Dogecoin’s “hype” factor has waned, he interpreted that lack of mainstream speculation as a positive sign, claiming “no one is selling Dogecoin like hyper aggressively,” which could foster stability in the near term. The sentiment, in his view, might shift sharply once traders realize that the coin has bottomed in its ABC correction, especially if broader market conditions turn more favorable. He concluded by reiterating the importance of watching these levels closely. He sees the $0.24–$0.18 corridor as a prime accumulation zone, views $0.16 as a clear stop-loss level in case the market breaks down, and believes Dogecoin’s price action around these thresholds will confirm whether the ABC correction is truly complete. Recalling his own words, “Dogecoin is looking very, very good and very, very discounted in this whole market,” he urged potential buyers to consider the coin’s risk-to-reward ratio at a time when other traders, anticipating the end of the so-called meme coin era, appear to be overlooking it.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Is Consolidating After The Flush Last Weekend – The Calm Before A Big Move?,2025-02-07 23:00:41+00:00,"Ethereum experienced one of the most aggressive sell-offs in its history on Monday, plunging 25% in a single day amid market-wide panic. The rapid decline sent shockwaves through the crypto space, marking one of the most volatile trading sessions ever recorded for ETH.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Support Sits At $90,6K Short-Term Holder Realized Price – Expert Reveals Key Resistance Level However, within hours, the price rebounded, erasing nearly the entire drop and stabilizing above key support levels. Despite this swift recovery, Ethereum now faces serious risks as it trades slightly below a crucial resistance level, leaving investors uncertain about its next move. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently in consolidation, attempting to form a higher low after the dramatic market flush from this weekend. He noted that this phase is critical for determining the next major trend, as holding above current levels could signal the beginning of a new bullish leg.  Failure to establish strong support could lead to further downside, putting Ethereum at risk of another correction. With uncertainty still looming, all eyes are on ETH’s ability to reclaim lost ground and establish momentum for a potential breakout in the coming days. Ethereum Prepares for a Decisive Move Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is currently trading below the $2,800 mark, struggling to gain momentum after last week’s historic volatility. The recent price action has left investors frustrated, as hopes for a strong rally continue to fade. While Bitcoin has shown relative strength, Ethereum remains stuck in a tight range, unable to break above key resistance levels. The uncertainty in the market has led to a decline in investor confidence, with many questioning whether ETH will be able to reclaim its bullish structure anytime soon. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that consolidations are forming everywhere. He noted that BTC, ETH, and most altcoins are displaying similar patterns—attempting to establish a higher low after the aggressive flush from the weekend. According to Daan, if Ethereum successfully breaks above its consolidation channel, it could gain the momentum needed to push above key supply levels and start a new bullish phase. However, failure to do so could lead to more downside pressure. The coming weeks will be crucial for Ethereum’s price trajectory. If ETH can hold above $2,700 and push toward $3,000, it may spark renewed interest from investors. However, continued failure to reclaim key resistance levels could push Ethereum into deeper consolidation, further frustrating market participants. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Testing Key Support on the ETH/BTC Chart – A Parabolic Move Could Be Next Despite short-term uncertainty, institutions are continuing to accumulate ETH, recognizing its long-term value. Historically, these periods of consolidation have been followed by explosive price movements. Price Struggles Below $2,900  Ethereum is currently trading at $2,750 after days of consolidation below the $2,900 mark. Despite multiple attempts to push higher, ETH has struggled to reclaim key resistance levels that would signal a shift in momentum. The price action remains uncertain, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,700 support zone while looking for a breakout above the $2,800 mark to regain short-term control. The most critical resistance level remains the $3,000 mark. If Ethereum can successfully push above this price and turn it into support, it will open the door for a rally into higher supply levels. This would strengthen the bullish case and potentially trigger a move toward $3,300 or higher. Related Reading: Solana Could Target $220 If It Holds Current Levels – Analyst Expects Short-Term Bullish Momentum On the downside, holding above $2,700 is crucial for avoiding further selling pressure. If ETH fails to defend this level, a drop toward $2,600 or even $2,500 could be the next move. However, as long as Ethereum remains within this consolidation range, traders will continue to watch for a decisive breakout. A close above $2,800 in the coming days would be the first sign that bulls are gaining momentum and that a new uptrend is beginning.

This bearish sentiment is further strengthened by historical data, which suggests that these investors shouldn’t be too optimistic about the foremost meme coin recording significant gains this month.  Dogecoin Starts February With 23% As Historical Data Paints Bearish Picture CryptoRank data shows that the Dogecoin price has suffered a 23% crash since the start of February. This follows the monthly green close, which the foremost meme coin enjoyed in January, with a 4% gain in the first month of the year. Amid this price crash since the start of this month, historical data also points to a bearish outlook for DOGE throughout this month.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Can DOGE Touch $1 This Cycle? Analyst Forecasts When You Should Buy And Sell Further data from CryptoRank shows that February is historically a bearish month for Dogecoin. The foremost meme coin has suffered a monthly average loss of 1% in February since it launched in 2013. DOGE has had only four monthly green closes in February over the last twelve years.  However, it is worth mentioning that Dogecoin has only once closed out February with a loss of over 20%, which was in 2014, when its price crashed by over 30%. As such, the meme coin could still witness a relief bounce, which could lessen the severity of the 23% price crash suffered since the start of this month.  Meanwhile, despite the historical data painting a bearish outlook for Dogecoin, crypto analysts have provided a bullish outlook for the meme coin. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi recently highlighted a similarity between DOGE’s current price action and that of the 2017 bull run. Based on the similarities, he predicted that Dogecoin could soon begin the next leg of its bull run, rallying above $1 and reaching a market peak sometime in April.  DOGE Can Still Reach $10 In This Cycle In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted that Dogecoin could still reach $10 in this market cycle. He stated that as long as DOGE holds above $0.19, the setup for a parabolic rally toward $10 remains strong. The analyst added that momentum is building for the foremost meme coin, indicating that it could soon begin the next leg of its bull run.  Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted that Dogecoin could at least reach $4.5. He stated that DOGE’s Average Directional Index (ADX) signals a potentially massive bull run on the horizon. The ADX measures trend strength by quantifying the degree of directional movement in price. Analyzing the weekly chart, the analyst asserted that a “super strong trend” could happen soon and will reach its peak in the coming weeks as the meme coin reaches $4.5.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Faces ‘Moment Of Truth’ As It Battles The Macro 0.5 Fib Extension At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.25, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst,2025-02-07 20:00:09+00:00,"Popular meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) has just seen a dramatic downturn that makes investors wonder about its future course. Driven by market volatility of Bitcoin (BTC), DOGE’s value dropped by around 20% over the past week. DOGE currently trades at $0.2551; its market value is $38.09 billion and its trading volume is $3.42 billion. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Set For A 10-Fold Explosion?

Whales have specifically accumulated 750 million units of the meme coin during this downturn. Usually preceding big price swings, this large accumulation shows a strong conviction in the long-term possibilities of Dogecoin. The current price of $0.25 is an ideal opportunity for investors who are ready to ride the wave of a possible recovery, according to some analysts, while others think DOGE may drop to about $0.17.

This is a strong sign of confidence in the market! pic.twitter.com/LyjIuZCF15 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 6, 2025 Dogecoin: Historical Patterns Point To Potential Growth Analysts claim that Dogecoin’s current market sentiment is a reflection of its 2017 bull cycle. Alongside similar corrections during that period, there were impressive rallies that led to new all-time highs. If this historical pattern is accurate, DOGE may have reached its local low and is getting ready for a significant ascent. Technical indicators also reveal hints of buildup and possible trend reversals, therefore supporting this positive view. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook The possible comeback of DOGE depends much on the general attitude of the Bitcoin market. Should Bitcoin settle and the mood in the market changes, Dogecoin might be set for a significant increase. Recent whale growth and historical assessments support this idea. Investors are closely watching the market, expecting that DOGE will regain its previous high prices and possibly hit new records.

As usual, investors should be cautious and undertake thorough research before choosing what to buy. But a change in the general market vibe or higher demand could contradict the negative view, thus monitoring it price movement in the following few weeks is quite important for deciding its main direction.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Massive XRP Accumulation – Whales Bought 520 Million XRP During Market Dip,2025-02-07 18:30:33+00:00,"XRP has shown resilience amid the market’s volatility and uncertainty, standing strong as it rebounds from recent lows. The price is now over 33% up from Monday’s low, signaling renewed momentum and a potential push toward higher levels. Despite ongoing turbulence in the broader crypto market, the price appears to be regaining strength, with investors closely watching its next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades Inside A Multi-Year Bullish Pennant – Analyst Sees A Breakout Above $4K Top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data revealing a key trend that has unfolded during this recent market dip. According to Martinez, whales seized the opportunity, accumulating over 520 million coins. This significant accumulation suggests that large investors remain confident in XRP’s long-term potential and could be positioned for a major price move in the coming weeks. With XRP recovering from its recent lows and strong demand emerging at critical levels, traders are now eyeing a breakout above key resistance zones. The coming days will determine whether it can sustain its momentum and extend its rally. If whales continue to accumulate, the price could be setting up for a significant surge as market sentiment shifts toward bullish territory. XRP Whales Prepare For A Rally XRP has been one of the strongest-performing cryptocurrencies in the market since last November, consistently holding key levels despite volatility. As the broader market consolidates before the next big move, XRP appears well-positioned to extend its rally. Analysts are calling for a bullish cycle, citing technical and on-chain data supporting a significant price increase in the coming weeks. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared key on-chain metrics on X, revealing that whales took advantage of the recent market dip to accumulate 520 million XRP. This large-scale buying activity indicates strong confidence from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals who see XRP as a valuable asset in the current market structure. While retail investors often panic and sell during corrections, whales and institutions strategically accumulate, setting the stage for a potential price surge. Historically, whale accumulation during market downturns has been a strong indicator of future rallies, as these large players tend to position themselves ahead of major moves. The fact that XRP has bounced over 33% from Monday’s low reinforces the idea that strong hands are buying at key levels. Related Reading: Solana Could Target $220 If It Holds Current Levels – Analyst Expects Short-Term Bullish Momentum With the altcoin showing strength and buyers stepping in at crucial levels, analysts believe a breakout above supply zones is imminent. If the price continues to hold strong, the next move could take the price beyond key resistance, pushing it toward multi-year highs. The $2.70 and $2.90 levels remain critical resistance zones and once cleared, XRP could enter a parabolic phase. Price Holding Strong Amid Market Volatility XRP has experienced significant volatility in recent days, with sharp price swings shaking market sentiment. Currently, XRP stands at $2.37, showing resilience despite recent market turbulence. Holding above the crucial $2.30 support level is essential for maintaining bullish momentum and initiating a recovery into higher supply zones. This level has historically acted as a key demand area, and if it holds, XRP could see a strong rebound. For bulls to regain control and confirm a trend reversal, XRP must push above the $2.72 mark. This price level represents a key supply zone, and breaking above it would signal short-term strength, allowing for a potential rally toward higher resistance levels. If buyers step in with strong volume, XRP could aim for a breakout above $3.00, setting the stage for further price appreciation.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Price Could Be Primed For Another 100% Move After Printing Capitulation Candle,2025-02-07 17:00:02+00:00,"Ethereum’s price action in the past seven days has led to the creation of a capitulation candle that might send it on another surge within the next eight to twelve weeks. This capitulation candle caught the attention of crypto analyst Ted Pillows, who noted an interesting repeating capitulation pattern for Ethereum.  According to technical analysis by Ted Pillows, Ethereum has printed a capitulation candle in early 2025, just as it did in the first quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. Capitulation Candles And Ethereum Historical Patterns TedPillows’ analysis highlights that the Ethereum price has undergone three major capitulation events in the past two years, all of which led to substantial price rebounds. Particularly, these capitulations have taken place in the weekly candlestick timeframe, where the Ethereum price witnessed intense selling pressure throughout the week. However, historical price playout shows that these capitulations have often marked the bottom before a massive price rally.  Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forms Flag And Pole Pattern For Possible Breakout, New Targets Emerge The first of such capitulations occurred in Q1 2024 and eventually led to a 100% rally over the next three months, with the Ethereum price reaching $3,950. The second capitulation took place in Q3 2024, leading to a similar upswing. With Ethereum now experiencing another capitulation moment in early 2025, the analyst suggests that the pattern is set to repeat. He believes that Ethereum is once again forming a market bottom, setting the stage for an aggressive upward move. Ethereum’s 100% Price Surge And Potential Peak If Ethereum follows its previous trajectory, the next eight to twelve weeks could bring a significant price increase, even as the leading altcoin currently struggles around $2,700. A 90%-100% pump after the recent capitulation would push the Ethereum price past key resistance levels and above its current all-time high.  Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts TedPillows’ analysis suggests that Ethereum’s ultimate price target following this capitulation could reach as high as $8,000. However, it is likely to encounter significant resistance near $3,950, a level that has historically triggered rejections in past capitulation cycles. Should Ethereum struggle to break through this barrier again, a temporary pullback could be on the horizon before any sustained move higher. Meanwhile, Spot Ethereum ETFs are attracting heavy inflows despite Ethereum’s price downturn. Institutional investors appear to be capitalizing on the dip and increasing their ETH holdings in anticipation of a broader market rebound. Spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded $513.8 million in inflows in the last six trading days, with BlackRock leading the charge by acquiring $424.1 million worth of ETH. This steady accumulation from institutional holders suggests growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and could lay the foundation for the projected 100% surge in the next eight to twelve months. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,725, down by 4% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

The project once had a market cap of over $2.5B, but a steady fall since then means it’s now available for a massive discount.  $AI16Z is currently trading at $0.35 (up 25% in the last 24 hours) and carries the potential to be the next crypto to explode in the coming months as AI in finance becomes the new norm. 3. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ($FET) – Decentralizing AI Development & Fostering Collaboration Three popular AI companies (Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol) have come together to create Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ($FET). This project’s goal is to make AI development open-source and free for everyone. While the biggest tech companies in the world want to hold onto their AI secrets, $FET wants to be a genuine catalyst in AI’s overall growth by promoting collaboration and transparency, as well as breaking down barriers to entry to AI. With a ginormous market cap of over $1.7B and close to 100K followers on X, $FET is showing that its ethos of mutual understanding and benefit is gaining traction with those who resonate with it.  Currently available for just $0.7, the future of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance looks very bright. We believe this is one of the best cryptos available under $1 right now. 4. Freysa AI ($FAI) – AI Agent-Powered Game Offering Staggering Rewards Freysa AI is at the center of a gamified crypto project that provides you with the opportunity to win huge sums of money, that is, if you’re smart enough to win.  Let us explain: a pot of cryptocurrencies is the reward, but Freysa AI, a self-evolving AI agent, has been designed to protect it at all costs.  All you have to do is convince Freysa (by talking to it for however long you want) to release the reward and send the money to you.  The upside is huge, by the way. For instance, a user who managed to make Freysa AI fall in love with him went home with over $20K.  A light-hearted crypto project, Freysa has the potential to become the next Pokemon Go, seeing as it challenges people and is a purely skill-based game. You can become an investor by getting 1 $FAI for just $0.036. Conclusion Having discussed the best big AI crypto projects in great depth, it’s our duty to tell you that all investments in crypto are subject to market ups and downs. That’s why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable sidelining. Also, none of the above is meant as financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin At $500K? Analyst Sees A ‘Perfect Storm’ For New ATH,2025-02-07 15:30:53+00:00,"Despite recent price volatility and market uncertainties, a renowned bitcoin specialist has offered an extremely positive assessment on Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies. Michaël van de Poppe, the creator of MN Consultancy, believes we’re witnessing the dawn of a historic bull market that could push Bitcoin’s value to previously unimaginable heights. Related Reading: Bold Prediction: XRP Holders On The Path To Millionaire Status—Analyst The ‘Perfect Storm’ For Bitcoin & Ethereum In a radical change, the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies have produced what van de Poppe refers to as “the perfect storm” for the growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This institutional support and improved banking custody alternatives have created the foundation for what may turn out to be the biggest cryptocurrency boom in history. The crypto guru suggests that similar exponential growth patterns could emerge by drawing comparisons to the dot com bubble of 1995-1999. “We’re currently in an ecosystem that has the most bullish government ever standing behind the whole perspective of tokenizing all assets […] and the adoption of Bitcoin into the government’s balance sheets,” van de Poppe wrote on X. Two Possible Market Peak Scenarios Arise Van de Poppe suggests two possible routes of development for the bitcoin industry. Based on the first scenario—which is rooted on the traditional four-year cycle—by the end of the year, Bitcoin may reach between $300,000 and $500,000, therefore attaining a remarkable peak. The crpyto expert also predicts Ethereum to reach $20,000. The perfect storm for #Bitcoin at $500,000 and #Ethereum at $20,000. The current sentiment of the markets is ultra bearish as the biggest daily capitulation in the history of the crypto markets has been taking place. Understandable. What’s next? Well, if your positions were… pic.twitter.com/q7IvIXM7VU — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 5, 2025 Conversely, he advises two more years of bull run might see Bitcoin valued at $1 million. These forecasts beat the present trade price of $99,000, with possible gains that would surpass the 20x surge exhibited during the 2017 bull market. Trade Conflicts May Accelerate Growth Of Crypto Van de Poppe believes that the looming trade war between the United States and China might benefit the bitcoin industry instead of being a danger. He believes that China’s choice to lower its currency value by selling dollars might reduce the value of the US dollar and bond prices, which could benefit other cryptocurrencies. This perspective challenges common mindsets about the market and offers a new way to understand how global conflicts impact digital assets. Short-Term Market Volatility Even while the future appears bright, there are still obstacles to overcome right now. For the first time in six to 12 months, analytics firm CryptoQuant discovered that nearly 50,000 Bitcoin units are in circulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin $100K Breakdown Spells Trouble For Short-Term Investors—Study Despite the broad bullish sentiment, the sale of this large amount of dormant coins could result in extreme market turbulence and short-term price pressure. Furthermore, even though long-term projections are still positive, the arrival of these ostensibly dormant coins onto the market raises doubts about the near future. This comparison between short-term volatility and long-term potential demonstrates how volatile and dynamic the bitcoin market is.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Gains Momentum: A Potential Upside Move Toward $0.2677 Looming,2025-02-07 14:00:16+00:00,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is gaining momentum as bullish pressure strengthens, positioning the price for a potential move toward the $0.2677 mark. After facing recent turbulence, buyers are stepping in to reclaim control, signaling a possible shift in market sentiment. This renewed push comes as Dogecoin finds stability above key support levels, allowing bulls to build upward pressure and challenge higher resistance zones. The growing optimism surrounding Dogecoin is driven by increasing trading volume and improved market conditions, which could fuel an extended rally. If the price continues to climb and breaks through critical resistance barriers, it may set the stage for further upside, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Analyzing DOGE’s Potential For Continued Bullish Growth Currently, Dogecoin is displaying steady bullish momentum as it gradually moves toward the $0.2677 mark. The price action suggests increasing buyer interest, with bulls attempting to sustain upward pressure after overcoming recent consolidation. If this trend continues, DOGE might build the strength to challenge key resistance levels ahead. Related Reading: Dogecoin $10 Price Target Back In Play? Here’s What The Charts Say Despite trading below the 4-hour SMA, DOGE’s price action shows signs of strengthening. With sustained positive movement, the meme coin may gather enough pressure to break through key resistance levels. A successful move above the SMA would confirm a trend shift, opening the door for more upside. Key technical indicators are reinforcing Dogecoin’s steady upward movement, with momentum oscillators signaling increasing strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the 50% neutral mark, indicating a potential shift in sentiment as buying pressure builds. A move above this level would confirm growing bullish momentum, possibly driving the price higher. Additionally, if the RSI continues its ascent, it implies that Dogecoin is entering a more favorable zone for buyers, reducing the chances of an immediate pullback. When combined with rising trading volume and other indicators, such as a positive MACD crossover, these signals strengthen the case for more growth. Should momentum hold steady, Dogecoin could be on track for a breakout toward key resistance levels, paving the way for a more extended rally. Can Dogecoin Maintain Its Uptrend And Secure A Stronger Rally? If Dogecoin continues its upward momentum, the price could gain traction for a sustained rally. A break above the $0.2677 key resistance level would strengthen the bullish outlook, pushing DOGE toward higher targets such as $0.3066. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crashes 40%, But This Analyst Sees A Bullish Setup Furthermore, bulls maintaining their momentum and driving the price above the 4-hour SMA will see DOGE transitioning toward a positive direction. This move may pave the way for further gains, pushing the price to key resistance levels and extending the ongoing uptrend. However, for the uptrend to remain intact, DOGE must hold above critical support zones and maintain steady buying pressure. Should momentum weaken, a period of consolidation or a minor retracement might occur, causing a price drop to support levels such as $0.1800 before another breakout attempt.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,5 Presales to Make Crazy Gains in 2025 as Bitcoin Looks to Breakout,2025-02-07 13:57:42+00:00,"Despite hovering under the $100K price level, analysts believe Bitcoin is still very much in bullish territory. Undeterred demand for $BTC at $98K also means the crypto market has remained fairly unfazed during the recent turbulence. Another factor driving optimism is the way $BTC is respecting the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), which is steadily moving upwards. Combined with the massive support being provided by the $92,500 level and $BTC’s RSI level also looking bullish, a breakout and then a rally looks imminent. Overall, the market is very optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, which is why this may be the perfect time to invest in some crypto presales that could explode in the coming weeks. Here are the top 5 to get you started: 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Crypto Presale for 100x Returns Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has crossed $70M (yep, you read that right) in presale funding, stamping its authority as the biggest and best crypto presale to buy into right now. The hype for this frog-inspired meme coin is partly owing to the way it aims to solve inequality in the crypto markets, empowering small traders with the intel they need to take on the industry whales. $WEPE will give token holders unique, real-time, and actionable market insights, trading calls, and investment strategies, all within a vibrant trading community. With any luck, this means they’ll no longer have to suffer at the hands of institutional investors who use insider info to gain the edge in the markets. In the pro-crypto Trump administration, $WEPE’s demand will only increase as more new traders join the ‘Frog Army’ in hopes of becoming a profitable crypto player. Join the $WEPE revolution for just $0.0003665 a token. The presale ends in just 9 days, so interested investors should act now. Here’s how to buy $WEPE. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana Layer 2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) is hands down one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. This is thanks to its revolutionary mission to make the Solana network more efficient, low-cost, and faster than ever. You see, even though Solana has had an impressive run of late – beating Ethereum in monthly revenue and posting the best quarter for any blockchain in history – several issues are holding it back.  These include network congestion and limited scalability, which can lead to failed transactions. By executing transactions off-chain and combining Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s efficiency, Solaxy ($SOLX) will breathe new life into Solana. Investing in the $SOLX presale (which has already raised a staggering $18.5M) would mean backing one of the best blockchains, Solana, plus one of the key factors that’s going to drive its future success. You can get 1 $SOLX for $0.001628, but the price will increase in the next few hours as the presale enters its next stage. For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Changes the Way You Invest in Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) is a one-of-a-kind crypto project that will change the way people invest in meme coins. It offers various meme coin indexes, whose prices depend on the cumulative performance of the coins that make up the index. That’s exactly how stock market indexes work! You can invest in one or more of four meme coin baskets, depending on your risk tolerance. Titan: Made up of well-established cryptos like $DOGE, $PEPE, and $SHIB, it’s the least risky and offers comparatively low but steady returns. Moonshot: It contains high-potential trending crypto coins that could break into the top 10 biggest cryptos in the world. Midcap: This includes meme coins with a market cap between $50-250M. It’s a bit riskier than the two above, but also more rewarding. Frenzy: This index comprises potential 100x meme coins, tailored for aggressive investors. As the crypto economy’s first project that allows meme coin investors to diversify risk, $MEMEX looks poised for growth – and over $3.4M in presale funding proves investors agree. You can buy it now for only $0.0159713 per token. 4. YourTrump ($YTP) – The Next $TRUMP? Whether you capitalized on the official $TRUMP madness, $YTP could very well be the second lightning strike. This is because, like Official Trump, YourTrump also derives its value from Donald Trump’s popularity. $YTP’s price depends on how many followers Trump has on his X profile. The number is currently just shy of 100M. The presale offers a tantalizing proposition as the token’s expected listing price is over 125x of what you can buy it now for (just $0.0572). Plus, with top industry players such as the Standard Chartered banking group expecting the next four years to be bullish for Bitcoin (and crypto overall), $YTP could easily be among the top gainers. 5. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – Combining AI & Blockchain Unlike other AI crypto projects, $LCAI doesn’t just take advantage of existing AI solutions. It aims to lend a hand in the technology’s development, especially regarding how it interacts with blockchains. Lightchain AI combines a revolutionary consensus mechanism, Proof of Intelligence (PoI), and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to build more secure blockchains. To this end, token holders will be rewarded free $LCAI tokens for completing tasks such as inference, model training, and computations that are crucial to AI development. Even better, if you’re an $LCAI holder, you’ll also get a say in the project’s development. $LCAI’s presale numbers are nothing short of outstanding. It’s raised over $15M at the time of writing, which goes to show just how much investors are responding to this AI-crypto partnership. You can get 1 $LCAI for $0.006 if you get in now. This makes it one of the top cryptos under $1 right now. Bottom Line Now that we’ve pointed you towards the best presales as Bitcoin prepares for a break-out, we’d like to once more reiterate the importance of risk management and due diligence in crypto investing. None of the above is meant to be financial advice, and you should always do your own research before parting with your hard-earned money.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

# Building Web3

Mert, co-founder of Helius, joins host Jax Dwyer to explore Solana’s rapid growth, innovative scaling solutions, and developer-friendly infrastructure. 

This episode covers Solana’s roadmap, the importance of founder-led marketing, and the future of blockchain-based applications, including NFTs, DePIN, and RWAs. 

Mert shares his early crypto journey, from working at Coinbase to choosing Solana over Ethereum for its performance-driven approach and how Solana’s unique approach to bandwidth and latency enables it to stand apart from Ethereum’s fragmented L2 ecosystem.

Reddit,solana,Tips for anyone trying to start using telegram trading bots?,2025-02-08 00:04:07,"

I'm already a sol holder and I'm aware there are risks involved in using trading bots. I'm not investing a substantial amount of money. I just have a few spare thousand that i would want to try trading sol memecoins with, and I've been seeing alot of videos about telegram trading bots. Can people recommend me good places/communities to learn better on how to use these trading bots and some of the safest bots to use that are not going to just withdraw all my money after a while lol. Also probably where i can get info and stay updated on new tokens and in general tips to stay safe while attempting to do this. 



I've heard of Bullx, but i wanted to hear if there are any more recommendations from the sol community.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,solana,Solana/BTC ratios fell from 413 Solana’s per BTC to 508 SOL’s per BTC. Swap time?,2025-02-07 22:57:52,"Last time this ratio point came up, I sold 1/8th of my BTC into Solana and traded back when the ratio went to ~400ish.

This move earned me quite a few extra few SOL’s.

I have 2 questions for this community.

1. If I’m doing this moves on a ledger that hasn’t been associated with my social security or me at all… tax ramifications? How can they prove I did this?

2. Should I do this move again as we’re at 508 Sol’s per BTC as I type this… should I double down and do 25% of the BTC this time?

Cheers.

Reddit,solana,"If you get rugged, you deserve it",2025-02-08 00:48:47,"After 5 years in this space, I've come to the conclusion that all of these ""traders"" have a combined median IQ of 85 and have absolutely no idea how any of this stuff works.


Blinded by their greed, these idiots flock to the crypto ca$ino when they should be mindlessely sitting behind a slot machine for hours. They'll have better odds.


Countless times I see ""muh 0.00006 soluna got stole what do?"", or, ""Got rug pulled for $50,000 on shitbuttfuckpissretardniggerinu coin we should report them to the SEC, this is fraud!"", or ""how can I get my money back?"" And every time I have the same exact thought: Fucking retard.


I don't even know why this makes me so angry, maybe it's because I've went through the trials and tribulations and actually learned how you can actually make money in this space. Or maybe it's because I'm angry at my past self for falling through the same pitfalls. Yes, I've been rugpulled, and still do, it's part of the fucking game. Yes, I've gotten my wallet drained for all my SOL and had to start over from scratch. But after every time something happens, it's because I didn't understand the game, and there's no way I'm getting back in until I fully understand HOW this was done.


If you're new to this space, there's only a few things you need to understand: Memecoins are worth 0, and if you get rugpulled it's because the useless thing that you bought is returning to its actual price. Everyone is here so they can sell something to some other retard for a higher price than they bought it for. Whoever owns most of the supply controls the price.


There are levels of retards. There are retards that wait for new launches and buy them in the hopes of getting in ""early"". There are retards that wait a few hours or days to make sure that the other retards haven't panic sold. There are retards that only buy dog coins. There are retards that browse Twitter religiously for new launches and hype around coins. There are retards that buy coins when right when they get listed on exchanges. And then there's the smart retard, that has gathered so much data on so many Memecoins that he finally found a pattern that actually makes some actual fucking money.


And then there's the people that actually know what the fuck they're doing and that are EONS ahead of everyone else. If you have dug as deep as I have, you will find some truly creepy shit. You will find wallets of bots that trade within milliseconds of newly launched/migrated tokens (I've seen these bots turn 3 SOL into 20 within fucking seconds). You will find the so-called MEV bots that sandwich your trades (just use lower slippage, idiot). You will follow money trails that lead to wallets with over 10 million USDC. You will find the same group of people constantly switching their Twitter handles. You will find outsourcing to countries where $100 can feed a family for a month (ever wondered where all those accounts that spam X and Telegram come from?). You will find that most of these people's ""communities"" are bought and paid for. And now you have big corporations and banks and celebrities stepping in, and YOU are actually retarded enough to think that you have a chance to compete in this space with your 0.5 SOL when you have absolutely no idea how any of this shit works? You're competing with people that have millions of dollars more than you, much much smarter than you, and that have way more technology than you, and you think you have a chance? Give me a fucking break. It's like if an 8 yr old child went up against Lebron James in a dunking contest.


If you have to ask other people ""how did they steal my SOL?"", or ""why did this rug?"", or ""Is this influencer a scammer?""   then you shouldn't be throwing your money in shitcoins. It's like walking through a bad part of town with a transparent backpack with $10,000 cash in it and wondering why you got robbed. It's because you aren't wise enough to understand how the game is played, and because you deserve it.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,solana,"Why Liquid Staking is Better Than Staking on Centralized Exchanges (and Why You Should Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase)",2025-02-06 22:52:53,"Hey,  
I have been seeing a lot of questions about staking lately, especially around liquid staking vs. staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, or Bybit. I wanted to share my thoughts on why liquid staking is the better move and why you should avoid staking SOL on Binance (bSOL), Bybit, or even Coinbase.

**1. Liquid Staking Gives You Flexibility**  
When you stake SOL through liquid staking protocols (like Marinade, Lido, The Vault or Jito), you get a liquid staked token (e.g., mSOL, stSOL, or jitoSOL, vSOL) in return. This means you can still use your staked SOL in DeFi..lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity while earning staking rewards. It’s the best of both worlds: you’re securing the network and earning yield, but you’re not locked out of using your funds.

With centralized exchanges, your SOL is locked up. You can’t do anything with it until you unstake (which can take days). That’s a huge opportunity cost, especially in a fast-moving ecosystem like Solana where DeFi opportunities are everywhere.

**2. Decentralization Matters**  
Staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase means they control the validators. This centralizes power and goes against the whole ethos of crypto. Solana is all about decentralization, and by staking with independent validators (or through liquid staking protocols that delegate to them), you’re helping keep the network secure and decentralized.

**3. The Vault Supports Decentralization by Delegating to Community-Driven Validators**  
One thing I love about liquid staking protocols like The Vault is that they actively support decentralization. For example, The Vault delegates to validators that are actively involved in the Solana community. These validators aren’t just big players with massive stakes, they’re smaller, community-driven operators who contribute to the ecosystem. By staking through The Vault, you’re not just earning rewards; you’re helping grow a more decentralized and resilient network.

**4. Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase**  
This is where it gets sketchy. Binance’s bSOL and Bybit’s staked SOL are essentially IOU tokens. You’re not actually staking on the Solana network, you’re trusting Binance or Bybit to do it for you. This adds unnecessary counterparty risk. What happens if Binance or Bybit gets hacked, goes down, or decides to freeze withdrawals? You’re stuck.

Coinbase isn’t much better. I used to stake my SOL on Coinbase because it was “easy,” but I quickly realized I was getting a lower APY compared to liquid staking or even direct staking. Plus, Coinbase takes a (35%) cut of your rewards, so you’re leaving money on the table. And just like Binance and Bybit, you’re trusting a centralized entity with your funds. If Coinbase has issues (like they did during the SEC lawsuit), your staked SOL could be at risk.

**5. Better Yields with Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking protocols often offer competitive APYs, and you can boost your returns even further by using your liquid staked tokens in DeFi. For example, you can deposit vSOL or jitoSOL into a lending platform or LP pool and stack yields. Centralized exchanges can’t compete with that.  


I used to stake on Coinbase because it felt “safe” and familiar, but once I learned more about how staking works and the risks of centralized exchanges, I switched to liquid staking. Now I use The Vault, and it’s been a game-changer. Not only am I earning better yields, but I can also use my vSOL in DeFi to maximize my returns. Plus, knowing that my stake is supporting community-driven validators through The Vault makes me feel like I’m actually contributing to Solana’s growth. It’s a no-brainer once you understand the benefits.

What do you guys think? Anyone else make the switch from CEX staking to liquid staking? ",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

* many bots and wallet drainers
* [coinfast.fun](http://coinfast.fun) rugpulls
* $50 to $50k challenges on twitter (some could be legit) but when you comment on one immediately you will get a bunch of similar accounts writing you messages to set up a bot that will of course send the money to them
* crypto call groups - most of them are just people randomly selecting coins and promoting them, with 80% of them ending in a rugpull minutes after the call
* shady exchanges that dont allow you to withdraw the money

I recently looked into the LPs on Raydium for the first time and used Metrix Finance to sim a few positions. The experience I've had before with LPs was from Pancake Swap previously.

Simming the position of SOL-RAY on Metrix shows that if you were to put down $10k based on a reasonable exposure percentage you're looking at about 100% APR give or take across 90 days. 

Is it me or do these seem to be too good to be true? You're looking at a full return within 9 months if compounding.

Now I need some info incase im missing something on the costing of running my own bot.

\- VM to run code base. I assume I dont need some heavy stuff here 100$ a month budget might be too much?  
\-Node, here is where things get complicated, Ive seen nodes under 49$ that claims to have optimisation for trading, others suggest getting a dedicated node(2500$).  
\-And the thing im most concerned about is if there would still be percentage fees to execute my trades.

Best case im looking at 150 USD worst would be 2500+percentage fee, with my worst case scenario making the project moot. So info on my third point would be highly appreciated.

The reason why I’m interested now is after seeing coins like TRUMP and SSE moon fast.

Is it realistic to think I can catch these coins early on dexscreener?

I’m not really looking to get into pump.fun coins as I’ve heard 99% of them are rugs, and I don’t only want to trade $30 as my buys. 

Can anyone set me straight, or just tell me to keep doing what I’m doing buying larger caps on Binance?",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,solana,Is Berachain a Threat to Solana? Seeking Insights!,2025-02-06 00:58:43,"Hey everyone,

I recently came across Berachain, and it got me thinking—could this be the next big thing that challenges Solana? From what I’ve seen, it’s gaining traction, but I don’t fully understand the technology behind it.

Solana is known for its speed and low transaction costs, making it a favorite among developers and traders. However, it has faced its fair share of network congestion and downtime issues. If Berachain offers a more efficient and scalable solution, could it take market share from Solana?

I’d love to hear from those who understand Berachain’s architecture better. How does its consensus mechanism work? What makes it different from Solana, and do you think it has the potential to outperform it in the long run?

Looking forward to some insights from the community! 🚀",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,solana,From being addicted to gambling to meme coins,2025-02-04 17:34:47,"I’m 30 years old, wife, no kid yet. My wife and I make decent salary compared to cost of living. (Midwest, not in a big city, have a home we bought June 2023 that has appreciated $45,000-50,000 since then at least). My wife and I are both government workers who will get a pension and make about $130,000 combined (my pay will max out at over 6 figs eventually) 

My wife is debt free as of a couple months ago and I have about $4,000 credit card debt. (I have a 1.3k tax refund coming so I’m still being positive) 

But I started sports gambling about 2021. It was bad, because back then cost of living was a tad lower, we had an apartment that was under $500 a month so even though I made less at that time I had a paid off 2011 car as well. I made $2600 month take home back then, so a lot of money to throw around (never was good at saving). I got into sports gambling, started with winning $20 parlays to turn into $350 etc. 

I made some decent investments in sports cards etc and made about 8-10k. We used this money to travel Europe where I proposed and I also started a side hustle (inflatable rental business company that I still run in summers, I don’t plan on growing it and only use it for side cash) 

I guess where my addiction was amplified was when i applied to get approved for an IDHA loan through my state (first time home buyer loan), they asked for bank statements. I applied in March of 2023. They denied me at that time saying “we see that up until March you’ve made $1800 sports gambling, we have to be fair with this loan and in our calculations we assume that you will be consistently winning $900 per month throughout the year which would push you over the income limit for the loan”

The lender told me I either need to wait until
June to reapply and not gamble at all till then so they won’t calculate future gambling winnings or to make a very large bet and lose on purpose.. so I made a $1,800 bet - 3 pick parlay on nba. I got lucky and that hit hit and paid me about $7,500. I took that money and used it for a down payment. We got the home inspected and will love our house. But the home inspector fucked us and on day one our ac/furnace wasn’t working which cost us $8500 total. 

I got into a tcg early and went to Gen con in Indiana and made some investments in that game early and made about 8-10k so we could pay it off. Around this time I started getting crazy with bets $300-1000 bets at a time on DraftKings. I’m still technically up, maybe 4k total. But I have recently banned myself from the sports betting apps because although I started betting smaller $25-50 bets I was going on a long losing streak and realized that I was spending more time looking at my parlays and tv to watch the game than not being present with those I love.

About 2 weeks ago I got into meme coins
My wife did warn me that it seems like what I’m doing is just something to replace my sports betting gambling. I started with $600 in SOL and built it into about 1k. My goal was to just build up to $1,200 to double my money and move stuff back into traditional crypto to help me pay off my $4,000 in credit card debt I have. 

About 2 weeks ago my brother (who invested $1,000 usd) and cousin (who invested $500 usd) got in early on a coin on Sol called $Ainti when it was announced at under 1 cent. 2 weeks ago Janice mcafee tweeted and the coin pumped up to $.42 cents - 100m market cap. My brother (who is kinda already rich) turned his $1,000 into $115,000 usd when he cashed out and my cousin (who’s broke and had debt) turned his $500 into about $75,000 usd. I guess this is what initially gravitated me toward phantom wallet. I tried telling my cousin it was luck and he would get pissed saying it was months of research (he’s only been in crypto since October 2024. 

I figured if they can’t 400x their money why can’t I 2x mine? 

The thing is, they did get lucky.. but I didn’t know it at the time.

I started with $600, turned it into $1,000 slowly. I played safe generally buying into coins wity $30-50 and getting out after making 20-30% increase or so

I also got rugged a couple times and lost money. I got rugged out of $600 yesterday and it.. hurt lol. The thing I didn’t realize is meme coins are way riskier than sports gambling even. It’s not other traders you are going up against. It’s scam artists. People constantly rug pulling 90% of projects and you don’t know when it will happen. 


I had fun with this, I’m not here trashing meme coins. Even though I lost, it was entertaining, but I’m now realizing this was just another scapegoat to replace me banning myself on sports apps. I gotta be done with both though lol. 

I guess some people get lucky and get that 1000x like my brother and cousin and maybe my luck will come later in life in some other way. lol. (I was on a 3 way phone call with them while their money was exploding up to $75,000 and $115,000 within 1.5-2 hours. I was happy for them, but also slightly jealous).

I’ve been putting paying off these credit cards for too long due to me not wanting to address them and pretend as if they’re not there.. so I will lay low and have a boring life until those are paid off now lol. ",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

What are the risks of using trading bots, and which ones are trustworthy?

Are there any recommended platforms or open-source bots that can be used safely?

i have been working for the past month on a smart contract with really interesting and advanced features like Arbitrage Pair Management, Flash Loan Integration, DEX Swaps and Profit Calculation, MEV and Flashbots Protection, Gas Control and Optimization etc.

the contract compile and deploy without problem, but since the last few adjustments now i have fees in the 3.000$ range to deploy the contract, i am setting up a batch script to merge multiple operation in one to keep the gas fees at minimum, but, for the love of God, i can't reduce the fees like they used to be, minimum range now is 900$ per deployment.

  
i want to specify i am testing on sepolia and through local hardhat network until the contract will be finished.

  
Anyone can help eventually with some tips that can improve the gas fee management? ",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,ethereum,Cheaper gas fees alone won't save ethereum. Innovation will.,2025-02-07 19:16:15,"Hey everyone, 

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you?

There was the opportunity to buy directly without a linked wallet (chooses that cause of lack of trust in the recommended wallet, but got that later).

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to encrypt data inside a smart contract on Ethereum?,2025-01-30 22:00:52,"Hello, everyone!

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

So, my question is: is there any way to encrypt data within Ethereum using another person's public key, whether with RSA, ECC, or some other approach? Has anything been developed to achieve this?",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

The challenge is that I only have the recipient's **Ethereum address**, but encryption typically requires their **public key**.

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

I have always sort of understood what they are but not completely. These other tokens on Ethereum like a gaming coin like axie infinity or any of the hot AI Coin’s are basically smart contracts that have been given their own tokens? 

Bitcoin and XRP have way smaller ecosystems because they don’t have smart contracts so they don’t have a reason to have all those tokens? 

If this is correct, are smart contracts always tokenized? Or are there smart contracts that can be carried out in Ethereum alone?",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,ethereum,I cant understand all this.,2025-01-26 15:40:20,"I'm currently preparing for in campus placements, and working on data structure and algorithms for hiring rounds. Meanwhile two people of my class magically somehow appear announce events about web3 blockchain etc etc and I'm not sure how they started getting funding for it. They went to Bangalore for some meetup, conducted some meetups in my city and now they arr going to eth denver, one of them posted about the visa approval and tickets to the event. I was stunned. I talked to them and they have become literally so arrogant about giving information, and said they don't give a fuck to studies of college.

Reddit,ethereum,I've created a Game and hidden seed words throughout it.,2025-01-25 10:07:53,"Hi reddit, I challenge you all.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

We hope you love it and have a nice day. **�**�",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO.

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Why capital gains tax is pure theft,2025-02-07 17:53:11,"Say you have $100,000 you want to protect from inflation. 

You buy an asset (Bitcoin, Gold, Real-estate).

In 5 years, your asset is worth $250,000.

You sell and must pay capital gains taxes on $150,000 (at 20% that would be $30,000 in tax).

But over those 5 years, the government printed 10% new money each year, which devalued your dollars by 37.9%.

That means they already taxed you on your wealth each year, so why are you also paying a ""capital gain"" on the sale?

So the calculation should be:

$250,000 - 37.9% depreciation - $100,000 initial investment

Your actual gain was only $93,150 after depreciation.

But you're being asked to pay 20% on the total $150,000 instead of on the actual inflation adjusted gains.

And even worse, the inflation numbers they publish are fake to make them seem better than reality actually is, so you can't even calculate an accurate depreciation over time (more accurate to use real estate prices to see depreciation rate).

So why the fuck do we allow them to charge us capital gains tax, when we already are taxed every year by the money printing??

Complete bullshit.

The UK government has ordered Apple to add backdoor access to encrypted iCloud data, citing security concerns. Apple is pushing back, arguing it would compromise user privacy. Rather than complying, Apple might remove encrypted storage from the UK altogether. If they cave, it could set a precedent for other governments to demand the same.

This is yet another reminder: Never store private keys or other sensitive data online. If your Bitcoin keys are in iCloud (or any cloud), they’re not really yours.

However, I feel like not many people talk about the risks of consolidation, so I’ll share a couple of basic tips.

Try using coin control to carefully select which UTXOs to consolidate and which ones to keep separate. If you’ve bought BTC with KYC and BTC without KYC, consolidating them is a terrible idea since your KYC BTC will ""contaminate"" the non-KYC ones. Always keep them separate.

Keep in mind that if you use a hardware wallet, your public key (not your private key) can be exposed when you spend. These wallets typically generate different public addresses to receive Bitcoin, but once you consolidate and spend, blockchain analysts can link all those addresses together and associate them with you.

Whenever possible, use CoinJoin to mix your UTXOs and make tracking more difficult. Avoid withdrawing all your BTC at once— instead, make multiple withdrawals of varying amounts.

Stay SAFU!

You can get even more niche than that too once economies grow.  The more niched, the more skill one needs to possess to do one tiny aspect of a job.

This is the same thing for money.  I used to like gold and silver, but niched money is superior.  Money that is invaluable to multiple trillion dollar industries like medicine, electronics, defense, and even jewelry does not make for efficient money.  I believe gold and silver won't be used as money in the future but fall back to their industrial use cases.

Bitcoin is min maxed money.  No other ulterior use cases so it can focus on being really great money.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,bitcoin,I am terrified to move my BTC,2025-02-06 14:53:23,"Hello fellow BTC pro’s

I want to start out by saying I am sorry for this post. I have somewhere between .5-1 BTC sitting on an exchange. I’ve been DCA’ing for several years now. And I am absolutely *terrified* to move it off the exchange. 

I know I need to do it. I see the constant comments about supply shock and the rapid removal from BTC from exchanges. I know mine isn’t safe where it is. 

The problem is, I’m so scared to move it. I work in tech, and I’m still not comfortable moving it. Then to top it all off, I have the memory of a fish. I’m scared I’ll lose my keys.. even though I do have several backup plans for those. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this initial fear? I just can’t be the only one who feels this way… 

Anyone who also faced this same issue want to share what worked to make you comfortable doing this? 

Anyone who DM’s me is going to get blocked. I read this sub like the morning paper and I’m overly cautious of being scammed (outside of my BTC staying on the exchange)🤡",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

2:01 PM
I am running the 3rditeration and just making a random 12 word seed on ian coleman bip 39 and then running seedrecover.py and putting ian coleman seed plus m/44 derivation address,, btcrecover says found seed! But it is to wrong address and its segwit but even the segwit address does not match ian coleman seed addresses. So I generated a random seed again with ian bip39 and ran seedrecover.py again it said found seed but again the same address as the FIRST seed that I tried?? Finding this out made me realize why btcrecover could not find correct seed when I ran it for 9 hours last night,, with knowing 11 of 12 words just 1 or 2 words in wrong order,,it still could not find? Also running btcrecover.py says tokenlist.txt not found,,, but seedrecover.py works. Also one last thing,, I also have a wallet.dat that loads in bitcoincore but seedrecover.py when first running I directed to my wallet.dat folder (not in btcrecover folder) but the software days "" wrong wallet format"" can you please help? The fact that seedrecover.py shows the same address no matter what bip39 valid 12 words you input with corresponding address is making me feel I did something wrong and the fact that it took 9 hours to not even find 1 missing word out of 12 makes me think its tied to the fact that no matter what valid seed I try it finds it but shows same address starting with 3h instead of 12bcz.....

Reddit,bitcoin,Help me make smart choices (why I shouldn’t day trade).,2025-02-07 19:52:44,"Okay, let me start by saying that I keep reading everywhere that it's not smart to day trade Bitcoin, and that's why I’m not going to do it. Everywhere, people say that you'll blow up your account that way, and I believe you. So, I’m not going to do it.

But my brain just can't grasp why it's unwise. Can you explain it to me? That way, I won’t keep doubting myself, only to have to sternly remind myself again that I **Should Not Do It**.

My mind says:

* Bitcoin has its ups and downs every day. If you look at the past few weeks, you see a low point and a high point daily.
* You can set a limit sell at a price that was reached multiple times yesterday during a peak. The chance that this price will be hit again today is quite high (and if not, you still own the Bitcoin). Assuming the price is reached, you sell your Bitcoin.
* With the money you’ve now received, you can buy new Bitcoin again. Using a limit buy, you choose a price lower than the peak at which you sold. This way, you can buy **more** Bitcoin than you originally had, increasing your portfolio. The amounts are small, but if you do this daily, you’ll gradually build up nicely. (If the lower price isn't reached right away: you haven’t lost your money—you already cashed in.)
* I take into account that there’s a small fee for buying and selling, but the profit is larger than the fee.

Where’s the catch? Is it that you don’t know when a peak will come and that there’s a chance you won’t be able to buy back cheaply?  
What else am I overlooking?

Reddit,bitcoin,How would home equity and mortgages work in a BTC based economy?,2025-02-07 21:42:09,"I owe $170k on a house currently worth $250k. Let's say the house's intrinsic value increases by 20% in 10 years: in today's economy it would be worth $300k, but with 3% annual inflation its market value would be about $400k. Then I could sell it for a profit of $230k after my lender takes their cut (ignoring that I've been paying down the principal for simplicity). Which is coincidentally about $170k in today's dollar.

Consider the same case with BTC and deflation: I owe 1.7 BTC on a house worth 2.5 BTC. Let's say hodlers are right and  BTC ""deflates"" enough in the next 10 years that it's worth 10x more than today. So my house's intrinsic value increases to 3 of today's BTC, but its market value at that time is only 0.3 BTC because of that deflation. If I sell, my lender gets all of the proceeds and I still owe them 1.4 BTC, which is 14 of today's BTC. Meanwhile my annual salary has deflated from 1.5 BTC to 0.15 BTC (maybe 0.2 BTC if I've been really lucky with raise negotiations)...

Here’s the simple truth: **Bitcoin is scarce**, and as more people adopt it and demand increases, its price will continue to appreciate. We’ve seen this pattern before and it’s only going to continue as the world shifts towards digital assets.

So, if you’re holding Bitcoin, don’t worry about the short-term fluctuations. **Patience is key**. The people who held through the bear markets of 2017-2018, or the crash in 2020, were rewarded handsomely. The future looks even brighter with more institutional adoption, global economic uncertainty, and growing demand for decentralized finance.

Long-term holding isn't just a strategy – it’s a **commitment to the future of money**. And in the end, Bitcoin will likely be worth far more than we can imagine today. Remember the post in 2035.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Immutable as fallen frost,
Where every trade was weighed in gold,
Yet no man saw the true cost.

A block was signed, a price was set,
And yet the road kept winding far—
For each who held, one more who bet,
Chasing some celestial star.

And so I stood where markets sway,
Between belief and cold distrust,
Two chains diverged, and who can say
Which one would turn to dust.



So When two chains diverged in the silent night,
I took the one that gleamed more clear,
Where blocks were formed in the pale moonlight,
And miners labored without fear.

The whispers spoke of wealth untold,
Of ledgers wide and futures bright,
Where every coin, once bought or sold,
Could shape the dawn of clearer sight.

The road was long, the path unsure,
Yet something in the air was new,
A promise held—of ways more pure,
Where trust is built from code, not few.

# Setting the Stage

Bitcoin is now approaching 40 years old. It has not had any downtime in almost four decades, quietly chugging along as each subsequent block is added to the blockchain - which is now approaching 2.1 million blocks in length.

Miners earning multiple Bitcoin per block is a distant memory, as each block now creates less than 0.1 BTC in newly minted coin - ***just about 14 BTC per day for the whole network.*** This makes sense though because everyone is acutely aware of the fact that the 'last bitcoin' will be mined in the year 2140, still a whole lifetime away at this point, and yet there are already 20,980,000 Bitcoin in existence. **That's only 20,000 Bitcoin left to mine for the next** ***90 years.***

With the dwindling block reward, half of miner revenue is now earned via transaction fees. An inflection point within Bitcoin economics, as the mining reward will only continue to decrease from here.

As a result, a fight for space on the base chain has created an unofficial hierarchy of the types of transactions and data that are worthy of being confirmed on the almighty blockchain. Lets take a closer look at what kind of usage it has, as well as the alternatives that are available.

# Blockchain Usage & Scalability

>BASE LAYER USAGE

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for Banks**

Banks transacting with each other domestically and internationally, via other second-order banks or via their country's central bank, are some of the biggest players using on-chain transactions. These banks have replaced SWIFT and other means of transacting value with the immutability of Bitcoin. These are some of the largest Bitcoin denominated transactions on the network, still regularly transferring 5-digit sums of Bitcoin between key players.

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for Governments**

As more governments got on board, their collective investments in Bitcoin within their sovereign wealth funds also grew. While many of the big economic players from the 2020s still hold most of the Bitcoin, smaller nations like Bhutan that were able to jump-on early were able to see their wealth grow immensely relative to nations that were their size a few decades ago. These nations have the ability to transact on the base chain either via paying the necessary fees, or by having domestic government-owned mining operations prioritize including their transactions in their own blocks.

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for the Wealthy**

The wealthy are still find it economically feasibly to conduct more of their important transactions on the base chain. They can afford the luxury of doing so, and this is looked on favourably by the recipient as the highest-form of receiving Bitcoin.

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for Data**

But Bitcoin hasn't been solely moving assets for decades now - many transactions on the Blockchain now exist as a means to move and store immutable *data.* This has allowed the Bitcoin network to act as a **Proof of Truth** for important government and corporate entities.

The 2030s saw chaos as AI-generated deepfakes of leaders and executives flooded social media, fuelling propaganda and nearly triggering wars. A solution: governments used verified Bitcoin multi-sig addresses to cryptographically sign messages and store document hashes on the blockchain, enabling news outlets and the public to instantly verify authenticity—leveraging Bitcoin’s immutability as a global trust layer.

* **Mass Consolidations**

Growing blockchain usage and the rise of second-layer solutions have increased UTXO fragmentation, forcing large entities to periodically consolidate their fragmented UTXOs via costly on-chain transactions. Due to high fees (driven by the massive number of UTXO inputs).

>SECOND LAYER USAGE

Many consumers have been pushed off-chain to second-layer solutions for most of their transactions. This is split amongst many different solutions, across a **spectrum of centralization**.

* **Lightning Network and Others**

While Lightning nodes remain the most decentralized second-layer solution, they exist on a spectrum of centralization. Wealthier individuals may own personal nodes, but in developed regions, families commonly share a node—akin to households sharing a single Wi-Fi connection in the past. Modern Lightning nodes are now user-friendly, with many ISPs bundling node services into modem/router packages. Families optimize costs by pooling Lightning channels, enabling a single on-chain transaction to open/close channels collectively.

Developing nations may also use this shared channel approach, but for entire communities rather than per family. It makes much more sense when a single on-chain transaction can cost the equivalent of a single individual's monthly income in some poorer parts of the world.

This results in a hierarchy of centralization, where consumers that are less well off may have to resort to lightning channels that are run by a third party to partake in the network.

* **Custodial Services**

Custodial services, while sometimes heavily criticized on this sub, remain essential for users unprepared to self-custody their Bitcoin securely—particularly those that are technologically inept. Institutions like Goldman Sachs fill this niche by offering trusted custodial wallets, acting as a safety net against scams and hacks that could irreversibly drain someone's funds. These services enable broader participation in Bitcoin, ensuring even the most vulnerable users can safely use BTC.

# Bitcoin Mining & Incentivization Structure

Governments holding significant Bitcoin reserves are increasingly motivated to secure large hashrate positions on the network to prevent adversarial control over an asset they heavily rely on. This nation-state dick measuring contest to dominate hashrate inadvertently creates unbeatable network security for all participants. Regardless of intent, the collective 'hashrate arms race' result is a win-win.

As a result, many government miners do not care as much about the revenue of mining, and can often mine Bitcoin at a loss, because that is a secondary byproduct to their main objective - **securing the network for their existing stack**.

By-product mining has emerged as a key method for individuals and small businesses to earn Bitcoin economically by repurposing mining heat for practical uses (e.g., heating homes, greenhouses). This approach also provides **non-KYC coins**, which are highly valued due to their privacy benefits and scarcity in today’s regulated landscape.

# Bitcoin As a Unit of Account

With the volatility of Bitcoin having dampened and more-or less is as volatile as the Forex market, it has become feasible for retail to **price their goods in both BTC** as well as local fiat currency without fear of the Bitcoin price drastically changing by the next day. In fact, in some countries they fear that their local currency is the more volatile of the pair.

It has become commonplace for things to be valued in BTC. **One of the first major things to be denominated in Bitcoin was the stock market** in 2034. This was a perfect fit for Bitcoin because it required no need for a perfectly stable Bitcoin price - and with so many corporations holding Bitcoin in their corporate treasury, it actually correlated with the market better as a whole.

**Wages and salaries have been increasingly paid in BTC** as demand for it grew, tech companies and others that wanted to attract the best talent start offering it as an option for Sign-on Bonuses and Performance Bonuses first, and eventually began to offer the option to accept wages in it. First indirectly via third party payment processing companies, and then directly through an internal payroll solution.

# Bitcoin Whales

Being a '**whole-coiner**' individual is now seen as a unattainable pipe-dream for most. Most Sovereign Nations, regions, and institutions hold Bitcoin in their reserves. The first-movers of the bunch, MSTR, El Salvador, Bhutan, and others have seen their leap of faith paid off as they comparatively outperform their counterparts over the past few decades.

Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE have more or less begun to heavily shift their economies away from one that is totally dependent on oil. With massive sovereign wealth funds needing to be allocated, these entities have **sought partial refuge in Bitcoin** and accumulated over a million BTC combined.

# Bitcoin Financial Services

Many financial tools and instruments are now built on-top of Bitcoin. **Bitcoin loans** have become commonplace, but lending is much more stringent than it was years prior. With the inability to print money, the cost of debt has likewise gone up. Lenders are much more selective to those they choose worthy of their Bitcoin. This effects the start-up industry the hardest as Venture Capital struggles to exist on a Bitcoin Standard.

# Fiat in 2050

**US National Debt has hit a record quarter-quadrillion dollars** ($250T). A household debt equivalent of $2.5M per family. Interest payments on this debt now exceed $10 Trillion per year, or 20% of national expenditures.

https://preview.redd.it/rpkarpjxwlhe1.png?width=2176&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c165a191342e969e7188cb39ddc925049eab8c9

At the microeconomic scale, the median American family brings in an equivalent of $400,000 annually, or approximately $100,000 in 2025 dollars, as CPI has increased at a CAGR of approximately **6%** over the last two decades - exacerbated by the money printer and nation state adoption of BTC.

Your average Family vacation costs **$13,000 USD.**

An average car will run you **$110,000 USD.**

A meal for one at McDonalds will cost **$77 USD.**

# Auxiliary Effects

* **The Effect on War** **and Conflict**

Without the ability to print the money necessary to fight in an unjustified war, nations around the world are much more picky as to the conflicts they choose to partake in (I say nations as a plural, but we all know who specifically). Justified conflicts find it easy to fundraise via war bonds sold to the public, but long-gone are the days of printing the equivalent double digit percentages of the GDP overnight to afford a war.

* **The Effect on Traditional Store of Value Assets**

Purchasing gold, or your seventh or eighth empty condo (*Looking at you Chinese R.E market*) in order to store your wealth is no longer the norm amongst the elite. With the ability to save in BTC, these assets become more attainable for industry (in the case of gold in electronics), or more attainable for homebuyers that don't need to compete with mega-corporations to buy their starter homes. This drastically reduces the price of real estate in places that got out of control in the late 2020's.

# Obstacles Beyond 2048

At this point, we can see even farther into the future than we could decades ago. New potential issues that will need to be overcome have begun to surface.

Our permanent colony on Mars has reached a double-digit population solely composed of scientists, but there are now solid plans to expand that into tens of thousands before the end of the century. **How will multi-planetary life conduct transactions on a network that is an entire block ahead at the speed of light**? How will we protect against a double-spend if someone spends the same coins on two different planets before the other one can catch up?

Even on Earth, China had effectively harnessed fusion power in the late 2030's, and with essentially unlimited usable energy, the **main barrier and cost driver for Bitcoin mining had shifted from electricity to hardware/silicon procurement**. With miner variable costs being near-zero (save maintenance), no miner became obsolete, even old S19s found value. Changing the dynamics of network hashrate control.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,This space is full of absolute fucking losers,2025-02-07 23:17:28,"Sorry all - but this isn't the crypto community I remember from the last cycle.

Unfortunately, I have to go to x/twitter to get the latest dialogue for what is happening in blockchain.  This sector is infested with people (mostly men) who are some of the biggest fucking losers I have ever seen.

And yeah, I get it man, you got 7 figures in your phantom wallet.  You got a nice house, you got a big dick, you fuck beautiful women.  I get it guys, ""YOU WON"".  But you know what else?  You are the biggest losers I have ever seen.

These guys can't stop talking about sucking trumps dick, fondling elons balls.  Man - what in the fuck happened to this space?  This isn't what we were looking forward to the last cycle.  Whatever *this is* is some sick, twisted nightmare of what we all thought decentralization could be.  This isn't what I signed up for and I am definitely not down for this sick, twisted, fascist shit.

I hate what has happened to this space and I hate the type of people it attracts.  It was always there, but now it is entirely too emboldened.  It's too bad there is a silver lining of something good somewhere wayyyyyyy underneath.  I honestly hope Satoshi is still alive, and when the US government makes the biggest gamble in history on BTC, I hope he rugs the entire thing and sends that disaster leadership to the end of a terrible regime.

Sorry guys for the vent, but this space is full of toxic, loser, parasites and it only seems like it will get worse.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

I was watching the page, and saw a massive Sell TWAP come in (and then shorted myself..)

Looking at the address, though, I found something pretty interesting, they have 6 million hype.

Do they just sell? Nope.

First, they open a 50k short at 24.8:

Then they execute a 20k 20 minute sell TWAP:

Edit: 

They added a second 60k 30 minute sell TWAP:

What does the price do?

Notice where it bottoms out. Right around their original buy price; 22.368$.

This is just one of their sub-accounts. It \*only\* holds6 MM of Hype. God knows what their other addresses hold.

Edit 2:

Hahahah, guess when they cancelled their TWAP:

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fees Drop Below 1 Gwei ($0.06): Low Fees, High Usage, Great Success",2025-02-07 18:21:24,"I have just crossed with the following [Tweet](https://x.com/DegenerateNews/status/1887644418947027287) that made me realize how Ethereum upgrades are really proving that they are a big success.

[Ethereum Gwei](https://preview.redd.it/bcpwxibntnhe1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d50dc776860b7d41df01eb0d114209a2c8ae94)

As you can see in the image above Gwei is currently at 0.986 ($0.06) at High priority which is really cheap comparing with what we have seen in the past before. If you have been here for a long time you will understand, I suggest you to search your wallet address on Etherscan, click on Analytics tab and then on TxnFees tab to enjoy watching how much you paid on ETH gas fees in the past xD

This low fees made me think that Ethereum transactions have decreased and are low right now so I decided to check it but I am quite surprised.

[Ethereum Daily Transactions Chart](https://preview.redd.it/30fsohvvunhe1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=402d75dcea5443010e57c6313ed2eaaec6cb2a47)

As you can see in the chart above Ethereum daily transactions are 2021 levels with 1,333,804 transactions yesterday. This confirms us that people are still using Ethereum actively even if the price is not in a great place. It also confirms us that all the upgrades released during this last years are working like a charm even if the inflation has raised a bit but I think that ""problem"" will be solved soon with some changes that are coming. Its also great to see how L2s are also working as expected in the whole Ethereum scalability roadmap absorbing traffic and reducing congestion on L1.

This is bullish because it makes Ethereum competitive with other alternative chains, it is not suffering from low demand and keeps evolving.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Finding Out About Crypto Ruined My Life,2025-02-06 23:33:56,"Let me preface this by saying that as someone with an engineering degree I’m a complete idiot. 

I learned about crypto while I was in college in 2017. Funny enough my classmate told me about bitcoin in 2015 when it was $400 and I laughed it off as broke college kid. Anyway, 2017, I became obsessed and I had my phase of telling everyone I knew about crypto and that they should buy.

I managed to turn a few hundred bucks into 10 grand. As someone who’s been a lazy procrastinator my whole life this new thing was my golden ticket out of needing to work ever again. Of course I didn’t sell anything before it disappeared.

By 2020 I had almost forgot about my bag. By 2021 I felt like a genius again and “knew” I was right. I still never pulled out cash, if I sold, it was to buy other coins and you know how that went. It’s 2025 now and I’m tired. I’m tired of what crypto has done to my mental health. 

These crazy crypto swings have made it so I’m entirely not grounded with money. What’s $500 when we’re seeing $5k swings (and never selling, just eating poopoo). 

That’s not even the best part, because don’t forget as lazy person the idea of one day becoming a crypto millionaire (so hopeful) is a great way to kill your career ambitions. Now here we are, crypto is finally gaining some traction in the real world and I’m not a millionaire no where close, my job is shit, and I got a ton of debt. 

Don’t be like me. Don’t romanticize your gains. Work hard in your life as if crypto is going to zero. I’m sure many of you will think this nonsense doesn’t apply to you. It does. Anyway I welcome the chat to shit on my and/or make me feel better. Thanks. 


Edit: Bear with me I said I studied maths, I’m not a writer. I’m still in profit. I have a mains bag and a memes bag. I don’t blame crypto. I am blaming myself, my point was with my personality finding something like this was a bad bad thing for me. 

I didn’t even consider the market being a little down right now writing this post. It was more so the stress of things outside crypto and dwelling on how I got here that made me write this now. Those choices made it so my unrealized gains aren’t as life changing. Hopefully this helps some people from making the same wrong choices.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,It’s genuinely disappointing how few people care about the actual technology anymore,2025-02-07 03:39:33,"Been here since 2016 and everyone used to follow the technology, and you could have great conversations about what technology is the best. Regardless of what subreddit you posted in. People were interested in discussing a chains current upgrades, or open to discussion on what they could work on, and what other chains were leading the way.

Now unfortunately you make any post remotely trying to discuss issues with a chain’s technology, or compare one chain’s technology to another, and that post is going to be obliterated. 

Personally as a software engineer I think Polakdots JAM upgrade is really important for the industry. And I frequently try to get insight into why other people think their chain of choice will have the best technology. 

But literally all you see now is “dead chain”, “look at price”, “look at how fast our transaction are”… like totally fine I get it most people are here for the gains now. But all the subreddits are essentially run by them now, and its impossible to have a solid discussion about the state of the technology

The more valuable it becomes, the more incentive there is to do good. In times of national or international strife, the value would supposedly rise, to encourage more positive actions. 

At some point it might even be useful to consider making this the basis store of value, since ""scarcity"" like gold is kinda silly, and ""arbitrary"" value like btc that is able to be manipulated by financial interest alone means that the rich continue to benefit more significantly than ""normal"" people. 

It would have to be one-directional tradable though, or something. Or only able to be purchased (or burned) by institutions delivering programs. 

Or awarded by consensus of others, with the scarcity of your awarding determining the strength of your vote to award. (To prevent people forming a group and just awarding each other back and forth). 

And penalties could be leveraged against institutions or govts that commit bad actions, like polluting a river, tearing down a forest, or, say, displacing an entire population from their residences. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

In fact the system could be entirely sentimental, where people contribute and vote for activities they see as good or bad. 

This is just brainstorm, no idea how any of it would work obviously. The idea though fundamentally would be to provide a counter to raw profiteering - some kind of social accountability for both good and bad.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Does anyone in this sub remember ERG and the hype around it? Need a reality check,2025-02-08 00:01:01,"When I first got into Crypto properly, it was ADA @ around $0.12. kept it up all last cycle and sold near the top, after degenerate margin trades to lose a big chunk too. 

Many vets from last cycle and the cycle before may remember how ADA was laughed at in this sub. Sure, Cardano Apes didn't give us a good name by screaming ""ETH killer"" everywhere, but eventually, this sub started to accept ADA's value and it became less of a joke. 

That's when I first heard about ERG, and there was a small swarm around it at that time. Created by the co-founder of LINK, PoW, profitable to mine and ASIC resistant. Smart contracts, all that sexy talk. 

But... It fell off the map. They seem to have been developing a lot during the bear, and have some crazy ideas like their cross-chain bridge etc. But it makes me wonder, it really was the sweet child of this sub at one point. 

Could it pull another ADA, and defy all odds to rise up amongst the decentralised crypto bros? I feel like I need someone to talk me out of going all in here. 

Is it worth a punt? What do people think here? It's giving me early ADA vibes, and my gut feeling was right with that one. It's things like their bridge that gives people the ability to become a 'watcher' of transactions. Earning a pretty solid ROI for doing so per transaction. Things like a stable coin on the chain, Palmyra, ADA collabs etc. 

I need objective views here. Hoping some boys in here can have an honest investors conversation about ERG or any similar projects with high potential. ",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

I am a beginner in crypto, I’ve got Coinbase and phantom wallet and Robinhood and have small positions in a few of the big coins: Solana ethereum and a very little bitcoin.

I’m curious about any good YouTube videos or classes I can take that I can build my knowledge on things like the blockchain, Bullx, and how to watch Dexscreener, candles, spot trends and everything.

Thus far I’ve just been following advice from friends and jumping on bandwagon meme coins and mostly getting cracked. Did make a bit of a windfall with the Trump coin (got in at 3 and out at 40) and I’m trying to replicate even half of that return on a semi regular basis.

Any advice on how to get started and what videos to watch would be great. I know there are tons out there so just trying to narrow down who to watch, what to read, who to follow.

Thanks so much! Hopefully this is enough characters not to be removed by a bot. ",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Interesting context, I could still sell my assets and deposit it into my US bank account….

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Best Crypto Based on Priority,2025-02-07 05:48:10,"The “best” cryptocurrency depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown based on different priorities:

1. Best for Stability & Store of Value:

Bitcoin (BTC) – As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is widely regarded as “digital gold.” It has the highest market capitalization, institutional adoption, and a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it a solid long-term store of value.

2. Best for Fast & Cheap Transactions:

XRP (Ripple) – Known for its speed and low transaction fees, XRP is designed for cross-border payments and bank partnerships. If regulation clears up in its favor, it could see significant institutional adoption.

3. Best for Smart Contracts & Decentralized Finance (DeFi):

Ethereum (ETH) – The leading blockchain for DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. While gas fees can be high, Ethereum 2.0 upgrades aim to improve scalability and reduce costs.

4. Best for Privacy:

Monero (XMR) – If privacy is a priority, Monero is the best option, as it offers untraceable transactions. However, regulatory concerns around privacy coins could pose challenges.

5. Best for Low Fees & High Scalability:

Solana (SOL) – A fast and scalable blockchain with low fees, often considered an “Ethereum killer.” However, it has experienced network outages.

6. Best for Institutional Adoption & Regulations:

Ripple (XRP) & Ethereum (ETH) – With banks and governments exploring blockchain technology, these two are often considered the most likely to gain regulatory approval and institutional backing.

7. Best for Passive Income (Staking & Yield Farming):
	•	Cardano (ADA) – Uses proof-of-stake for secure and energy-efficient staking.
	•	Ethereum (ETH) – After its transition to proof-of-stake, you can stake ETH for rewards.
	•	Cosmos (ATOM) – Offers staking with decent yields and interoperability with other blockchains.

8. Best for Emerging Growth & AI Integration:
	•	Fetch.ai (FET) – A leader in AI-integrated blockchain solutions.
	•	Internet Computer (ICP) – Aims to decentralize cloud computing and web services.

Final Thoughts:
	•	For long-term holding (store of value): Bitcoin (BTC)
	•	For smart contracts & DeFi: Ethereum (ETH)
	•	For fast & cheap transactions: XRP or Solana (SOL)
	•	For privacy: Monero (XMR)
	•	For staking/yield farming: Cardano (ADA) & Cosmos (ATOM)

One of the issues we currently face nowadays that has been keeping me up at night is all the big players now taking money out of the pot. Heck, we even have the President of the United States himself throwing his coin in the ring, along with his old lady’s meme coin to boot!

The issue here is that all the dumb money is now so overly saturated, so that useless and worthless coin you and I decided to invest in months or even years ago may never suck in enough of that dumb money to pump it to the Moon and beyond.

We need these dummies. They serve as exit liquidity to inevitably enrich ourselves, because let's be real here, this is the only reason why any of us buy meme coins to begin with am I right?

Fast forward to today though, and we have players like Solana, which grants the ability for any thot and their pimp such as the Hawk Tuah Girl to create a coin, have some shady somewhat smart people market it, and then rug all the dummies who thought they would get rich off it, then rinse and repeat.

This is a problem see, because all of that dumb money is drying up, plus if you could believe it, some of these dummies actually learn their lesson and actually stop investing in dumb projects... which becomes our problem in the end.

I'll leave you all with a question: Will 2025 be another cryptocurrency super cycle year, or is the real money made these days strictly by creating, promoting, and rugging the mentally challenged?",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,X Payments.. just ask Grok,2025-02-07 20:13:50,"""Which cryptocurrency would be best suited to be utalised by x payments based on technical requirements?""


To determine which cryptocurrency would be best suited for X Payments based on technical requirements, let's examine several key aspects:

Speed and Scalability
XRP (Ripple) and XLM (Stellar):
Both are specifically designed for fast, low-cost international transfers. 
XRP can handle thousands of transactions per second with very low fees, making it suitable for high-volume, real-time payments.
XLM similarly offers fast transaction times and scalability, with a focus on financial inclusion and cross-border transfers.

Transaction Costs
Stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC):
They typically have lower transaction fees, especially on networks designed for efficiency like Tron for USDT or Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions for USDC.
Stablecoins provide an advantage in terms of transaction cost predictability, which is crucial for payment systems.

Volatility
Stablecoins:
Being pegged to fiat currencies like the USD, they offer stability which is vital for a payment system aiming to avoid the price swings common in crypto markets.

Integration and Ecosystem
Ethereum (ETH):
With its smart contract capabilities, Ethereum could enable more complex payment systems or additional features like loyalty programs or automated refunds. However, its high gas fees and slower transaction times compared to others might be a drawback unless using Layer 2 solutions.
Bitcoin (BTC):
While Bitcoin has significant brand recognition and is widely accepted, its transaction speed and fees are less optimal for everyday payments without the use of the Lightning Network, which adds another layer of complexity.

Decentralization vs. Control
Dogecoin (DOGE):
Although Dogecoin has the backing of Elon Musk, technically, it's based on Litecoin's codebase, offering faster block times than Bitcoin but with higher volatility than stablecoins. Its community support and lower fees could make it appealing, but its technical setup isn't necessarily superior for payment systems.

Conclusion Based on Technical Requirements:
Based purely on technical merits for payment processing:
XLM (Stellar) stands out for its balance of speed, low cost, and scalability. It's designed for use in payment systems, particularly for cross-border transfers, which could be a key feature for X Payments aiming for global reach.
XRP (Ripple) is another strong contender due to similar attributes, though its regulatory situation might be a concern.
Stablecoins like USDC or USDT would provide stability and low transaction costs, making them excellent for everyday transactions.

Recommendation: 
Stellar (XLM) might be the most technically suited for immediate integration into X Payments due to its focus on fast, low-cost transactions, scalability, and existing partnerships in finance. However, integrating a stablecoin for its stability could complement this, offering users both options for different use cases.

This assessment focuses on technical suitability and does not account for market sentiment, regulatory issues, or Musk's personal endorsements which could also sway the decision towards Dogecoin or Bitcoin.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"If trading is 70% controlling your emotions and 30% good planning, why is AI so bad at it?",2025-02-06 09:27:04,"Most tutorials I've watched talk about having a plan and sticking to it, and that sticking to it might be difficult if you don't have your emotions in check/under control/ able to be turned off and remain rigidly committed to the plan.

Since AI is supposed to be good at pattern recognition, this seems like it should be an ideal field for AI to excel at - and without the emotion of human responses. 

But I've tried a number of different AI bots available in my exchange and all of them do nothing except lose money. It strikes me as a little odd because it should be very easy to create an API to follow the ""regular"" trading rules, and AI should be better at it since it has the advantage of context as well.

Imagine a setup where staking your tokens could be as straightforward as setting up a direct deposit for your paycheck but with the potential for much more significant returns. There's this new approach where instead of juggling multiple platforms, everything's streamlined into one spot, making the whole process less of a brain teaser.

And these reward systems? They're getting creative, offering boosts in ways that were less common before. It's like the DeFi scene is quietly shifting towards making things more user-friendly, where you don't need to be a crypto wizard to get the most out of your investments.

It's an interesting development, seeing how trad DeFi complexities are being tackled with tech that feels almost... intuitive. Just an observation of how the landscape is changing, becoming more accessible, and possibly more rewarding for everyone involved.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Take back control, learn, align, and gradually reinvest in crypto with purpose",2025-02-07 11:32:13,"Investing in crypto can feel overwhelming, especially when emotions and market volatility take over. But what if you stepped back and gave yourself a chance to reset? Start by asking yourself these fundamental questions: Why am I in the cryptosphere? What values brought me here? Are my investments aligned with these values and goals? 

Here's a suggestion, pause, reflect, and use this as an opportunity to rebuild your portfolio with intention.

Step out completely, consider selling everything, converting your investments back into your local currency. This can help you reset emotionally and clear any biases tied to your current portfolio.

Dedicate time to knowledge, commit 100 hours to fully understanding the space. Read white papers, blue papers, and yellow papers. Explore the products, dive into the code if possible, and spend time engaging with communities. Learn the history and technical aspects of projects so you can evaluate them for what they truly are, not what the marketing tells you they are.

Breadcrumb your way back in. For every hour you spend enriching your understanding, allow yourself to reinvest just 1% of your stack. This gradual approach gives you time to think critically and make informed decisions about how to allocate your net worth across multiple projects.

Slowly reinvesting also allows you to observe how your values align with your investments. For example, are you prioritizing decentralization? Utility? Innovation? Use your values as your compass, not market hype.

Own your decisions. As you rebuild your portfolio, make choices based on your own criteria. Don't trust anyone's advice blindly, not even mine. Trust in the knowledge you've gained and the research you've done. If you don't think for yourself, the market will think for you, and you'll always be at its mercy.

This approach isn't about abandoning crypto, it's about taking back control. By stepping out, educating yourself, and gradually reinvesting, you give yourself the freedom to think clearly, align your portfolio with your goals, and make informed decisions that truly represent your values.

So, Redditors, how would you allocate those 100 hours? 50 hours reading on the top 5 biggest and 50 hours on the other remaining 95? what would your spread look like?

A) Salvage what’s left and rotate into BTC/stocks?

B) Hold out and hope they eventually recover

You could prove the inputs for each iteration of the loop outputs the inputs for the next iteration of the loop. This is highly parallelisable and the polynomials involved would be tiny making inversion steps much simpler.

You would then need some way to succinctly aggregate all those mini proofs.

Is this pure silliness or might there be something here?

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,Hashing conundrums,2024-12-20 20:49:23,"I have two questions about hashing that I thought might as well be merged into one post.

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

Are there any standard actually proper ways of doing something like this?",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365

I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

  
Thanks! (:",2025-02-08 00:50:51.009365
Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.
