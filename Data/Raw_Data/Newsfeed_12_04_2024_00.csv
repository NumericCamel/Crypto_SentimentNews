Edwards posits that Bitcoin’s journey to $100,000 could be the catalyst for an unprecedented price acceleration. He suggests that once this psychological and technical barrier is breached, Bitcoin could potentially double in value within weeks. Drawing parallels with gold’s recent performance, Edwards stated, “If you look at gold this year, it went up 33% in 16 weeks—that’s a $3.8 trillion move in a really old asset. For Bitcoin to go from $100K to $200K, that’s just $2 trillion on an asset that trades 24/7 and is more accessible globally.” He emphasizes that Bitcoin’s relatively smaller market capitalization compared to gold allows for more rapid price movements. Historically, after surpassing previous all-time highs, Bitcoin has experienced significant and swift appreciations, entering periods of price discovery where supply constraints can lead to vertical price increases. When Will Bitcoin Price Double? The $100,000 mark is not just a round number; it represents a significant resistance level due to several factors. Edwards highlighted the presence of a substantial sell wall at this price point, noting, “We have the biggest sell wall we’ve ever seen in the order books for Bitcoin at $100,00. I think just yeah once that’s cleared out, that’s when you know everyone who wanted to sell has sold and you have these really sharp rapid vertical price appreciation moves because there’s just no more supply left.” Related Reading: MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Streak: 15,400 BTC Added This Monday Additionally, many investors who entered the market at lower prices may view $100,000 as an optimal point to realize profits, potentially creating selling pressure. However, Edwards remains optimistic that this barrier will be surpassed, especially within the next few months, given the seasonal strength observed in Bitcoin’s price movements during Q4 and Q1. “We are [at a point] in the cycle where we are seasonal and this is kind of like the optimal two to four month period, […] maybe a five to six month period every four years. After each Halving every four years, you have about 12 to 18 months where you get 90% to 95% of all the cycles returns out of every four years. So most of it happens in that one year alone. If you look at Q4 and Q1 that again is the majority of the returns […] once you have a strong monthly breakout above all time,” the hedge fund CEO stated. While Edwards is bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects, he cautions investors about the inherent volatility of the market. He pointed out that corrections of 20% to 30% are normal during bull markets and that investors should be prepared for such fluctuations. “It’s normal to have 30% drawdowns every few months in a Bitcoin bull market,” he noted. Factors such as increasing leverage in the market could exacerbate price swings. Edwards mentioned that if leverage and funding rates continue to rise without chipping away at the existing sell wall, Bitcoin could revisit lower support levels, potentially around $80,000. However, he emphasizes that such volatility is a natural part of Bitcoin’s growth cycle and not necessarily indicative of a long-term downturn. The End Of The Traditional 4-Year Cycle? A significant point of discussion was whether the traditional 4-year cycle, largely driven by the halving events, is reaching its conclusion. Edwards believes that as Bitcoin matures and integrates more deeply with traditional financial systems, the impact of the halving on market cycles will diminish. “As Bitcoin’s inflation rate decreases and it becomes more integrated with traditional finance, the four-year halving cycles may become less impactful. The large 80% drawdowns we’ve seen in the past might not happen in future cycles,” he stated. This maturation process could lead to more stable growth patterns and reduced volatility. Edwards suggests that future cycles may see shallower corrections, possibly around 60% rather than the dramatic declines of previous years. Related Reading: Data Shows Selling Pressure Mounts On Bitcoin: Is The Bull Run at Risk? Notably, several potential catalysts could propel Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented levels. Edwards mentioned the possibility of the US government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President-elect Donald Trump. While he estimates the probability of this occurring in 2025 to be around 30%, he acknowledges that such an event would be a game-changer. “Assuming [the U.S. government] doesn’t sell their existing holdings is great, but it’s probably not going to help the cycle a lot. Actively buying Bitcoin could be a game-changer,” he remarked. Corporate adoption is another significant factor. The potential for major corporations to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets could drive substantial demand. Edwards highlighted the upcoming vote by Microsoft on this matter, saying, “Let’s hope it’s Microsoft [on December 10].” Furthermore, the success of spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has opened the doors for institutional investors. The sustained demand from ETFs has been absorbing Bitcoin supply steadily. Edwards observed, “The ETFs have just been sucking Bitcoin out of the system ferociously.” Bitcoin Price Predictions Edwards provided a base and an optimistic scenario for the Bitcoin price in this cycle. He stated, “I’d be surprised if we don’t get to $140,000.” This base case assumes steady market conditions without any extraordinary positive events. In a more optimistic scenario, he believes Bitcoin could reach $200,000, especially if significant catalysts, such as government or corporate adoption, materialize. “We could easily get to $200,000. Once we clear those all-time highs, Bitcoin does multiples very quickly,” he explained. He concluded: “”Once we’re above $100,000, people who aren’t in Bitcoin just cannot comprehend Bitcoin above $100,000 […] That’s when you see the real switch flick and the flows happen.” At press time, BTC traded at $94,814.

The cryptocurrency had its biggest 24-hour gain in the last month, which boosted its market capitalization to $44.7 billion.

See charts below… https://t.co/OXkUPU1un4 pic.twitter.com/VOCZMOTo5Q — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 Institutional support is further giving the bull case credibility. The CIO at Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, recently stated that Cardano was one of his top altcoin choices for 2024. According to Yusko, traditional banks will be forced to introduce cryptocurrencies like ADA in the future to maintain their status quo. Resistance & Support Levels Under Focus While the rally is exciting, technical analysts suggest caution. The altcoin recently failed to break past the resistance level of $1.15, which raises questions about whether the uptrend can hold. Analysts point out that ADA must decisively reclaim this resistance to sustain its bullish momentum. If ADA succeeds in breaking through and holding up above $1.15, it could open a fresh wave of buying to carry the price even higher. If it fails, there could be a pullback to some critical support levels around $0.88. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle Broader Market Trends Could Boost ADA Cardano is just seeing its surge as the overall crypto market is filled with fresh momentum. Bitcoin is approaching $100,000 and the recently held US presidential election brings much-needed optimism for the introduction of friendlier policies to cryptos. The positive context will therefore become a tailwind for ADA and other altcoins. Meanwhile, Cardano plans to release 18.53 million ADA tokens on December 4, which are worth approximately $20 million, adding to its momentum. An increase in supply can be viewed as dilution; however, the funds will go towards staking and treasury reserves, which may boost long-term growth. At present, Cardano seems to be on the bright side of things, but the future depends on breaking some key resistance levels and holding investor confidence.

Despite this uncertainty, key data from Santiment provides a glimmer of hope for Dogecoin enthusiasts. Over the weekend, Dogecoin whales accumulated an additional 160 million DOGE, signaling potential confidence in the meme coin leader’s upward trajectory. This renewed whale activity comes when Dogecoin attempts to regain momentum and reestablish its market position. Such large-scale accumulation often precedes significant price movements, suggesting the possibility of further upside in the coming weeks. Related Reading: XRP Reaches 6-Year High – Whales And STH Accumulate Together As DOGE inches closer to the psychological $1 target, the next few weeks will be critical for the meme coin. A breakout above key resistance levels could reignite retail investors’ enthusiasm and signal the start of a new bullish phase. However, failure to sustain this momentum may lead to continued volatility, testing the patience of even its most loyal supporters. Dogecoin’s path forward remains uncertain, but with whales stepping in and market interest reignited, the stage is set for a potentially transformative period for the popular cryptocurrency. All eyes are on DOGE as it sets its sights on the elusive $1 mark. Dogecoin Sets High Expectations Dogecoin is capturing market attention as it surpasses multi-year resistance levels and embarks on what some are calling an “only up” trajectory. This impressive rally has reignited interest in the meme coin leader, solidifying its dominance in the meme coin market. Analysts and traders closely monitor Dogecoin’s price action, with many expecting further highs. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared data from Santiment, revealing that Dogecoin whales accumulated an additional 160 million $DOGE over the weekend. This significant whale activity lends credibility to the bullish narrative surrounding DOGE, suggesting that key market players are positioning themselves for continued upside. Historically, such large-scale purchases often precede substantial price movements, adding to the optimism that Dogecoin could maintain its upward momentum. Despite the bullish sentiment, risks remain. Dogecoin’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory, which currently faces a crucial test at the $100,000 level. If Bitcoin fails to break above this psychological barrier in the coming days, the broader crypto market could experience a pullback, potentially dragging DOGE down. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Hit $1 – Price Struggles To Break Above Major Resistance For now, Dogecoin continues to lead the meme coin market, setting new benchmarks and captivating investors. As whales double down and market dynamics evolve, the coming weeks will determine whether Dogecoin can maintain its rally or face a temporary correction. DOGE Testing Liquidity  Dogecoin is positioning itself for a potential bullish continuation as it forms a technical pattern that, once broken, could propel the price to new highs. This pattern reflects growing optimism among traders, aligning with the broader upward momentum in the crypto market. However, DOGE faces a crucial test at the $0.44 resistance level, which has acted as a strong barrier in recent sessions. A decisive break above this level could set the stage for another significant rally. Currently, DOGE is testing demand around the $0.42 mark, a critical support level that has helped sustain its recent price action. Holding this level is essential for maintaining bullish sentiment. If DOGE breaks above $0.44, it could attract renewed buying interest, driving the price into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Cardano Transactions Rise To Multi-Year Highs – Metrics Support Bullish Outlook Conversely, failure to breach the $0.44 resistance could lead to prolonged consolidation.

Crypto analyst Kevin, known on the social media platform X as @Kev_Capital_TA, has shared an updated perspective on a positive trajectory for the Dogecoin price, maintaining that the range of $1.30 to $1.50 is still a viable target. His recent post pointed to this price zone as a critical point of interest on his macro chart, aligning with the current market sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Revisiting Kevin’s Macro Analysis And Earlier Projections This bullish prediction regarding the Dogecoin price builds on Kevin’s earlier analysis from September 18, where he outlined broader price targets as it approached a golden cross on the weekly timeframe for the first time in four years. This technical pattern is often seen as a signal of sustained bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $245,000? Here’s When You Should Be Expecting It Back then, he suggested that the Dogecoin price performance during this cycle could lead to price levels ranging from $0.93 for moderate growth to as high as $3.80 in an exceptionally strong market environment. Interestingly, both of these targets would see the Dogecoin price trading at new price territories higher than the 2021 peak. At that time, the Dogecoin price was trading at $0.10 and was on its way to break above the upper trendline of a descending channel. Since then, it has reached a peak of $0.44, translating to a 340% increase.  Since the analysis, the meme coin has manifested this golden cross, prompting a strong bullish outlook for its price trajectory. Kevin’s updated $1.30-$1.50 target represents a midpoint that reflects both the coin’s current trajectory and the potential for continued growth under favorable conditions. The Path To $1.5 Dogecoin’s chart patterns and broader market sentiment support Kevin’s optimism. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.4237 and has declined by about 2.5% in the past 24 hours since it reached a peak of $0.44. Interestingly, this $0.44 peak saw the Dogecoin price reach its highest point since May 2021.  Related Reading: Fantom Price Breakout: Analyst Shares Anatomy Of FTM’s 18,000% Move To $150 By 2025 Reaching the $1.30 or $1.50 price targets would translate to a further 172% and 240% increase, respectively, from the current price level. However, the first step would be a decisive break above $0.44 and then a successive break above its current all-time high of $0.7316.  Having already climbed by 330% over the past six weeks, Dogecoin is displaying signs of sustained growth, supported by market conditions and technical indicators.

Currently trading above $95,000, the leading cryptocurrency holds a pivotal level that will likely dictate its next move. This key zone will determine whether Bitcoin regains upward momentum or seeks lower-level liquidity to establish stronger support. Related Reading: XRP Reaches 6-Year High – Whales And STH Accumulate Together Despite the recent volatility, market participants remain optimistic, as on-chain data provides fresh insights. According to CryptoQuant, a notable uptick in stablecoin transfer volumes has coincided with Bitcoin’s price action. This metric often signals increased purchasing power entering the market, a potential precursor to renewed buying interest in Bitcoin. As Bitcoin consolidates above $95,000, traders and investors closely monitor its ability to reclaim psychological resistance at $100,000. Conversely, losing support could push BTC to retest lower levels near $90,000 or even deeper liquidity zones.  Bitcoin And Stablecoins: What They Have In Common? Bitcoin has achieved a remarkable milestone, staying less than 1% away from the coveted $100,000 mark, driven by a wave of institutional and retail buying. This historical rally reflects a growing global demand, with investors from various countries utilizing stablecoins to purchase BTC. Stablecoins have emerged as the preferred bridge, enabling seamless transactions across borders and currencies. According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, the recent surge in stablecoin transfer volumes coincided with Bitcoin’s price ascent. This trend highlights stablecoins’ significant role in providing liquidity and driving market momentum. Cash inflows through stablecoins create robust support for Bitcoin’s price, allowing it to maintain upward pressure even as it nears critical psychological levels. The correlation between stablecoin activity and Bitcoin price action offers valuable insights into market dynamics. Increased stablecoin transfers often signal heightened demand for Bitcoin, providing a reliable indicator of potential price movements. This interplay is particularly relevant in identifying periods of high buying pressure, as stablecoins facilitate quick and efficient market participation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Hit $1 – Price Struggles To Break Above Major Resistance As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 milestone, the continued influx of stablecoin-driven liquidity underscores the asset’s global appeal and resilience. Whether this momentum leads to a breakout above $100,000 or a period of consolidation, the role of stablecoins in fueling demand will remain pivotal in shaping Bitcoin’s price trajectory. BTC Price Nears Critical Zone Bitcoin currently holds above the crucial $95,000 level, a price that will play a decisive role in its short-term trajectory. This level acts as a psychological and technical support zone that could propel BTC toward the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone this week or delay the breakthrough until next year. For Bitcoin to breach $100K, the $95,000 level must hold for several days, allowing sufficient time to fuel demand and attract fresh liquidity. Sustained buying pressure around this range will likely enable BTC to break above the key psychological barrier, continuing its historic rally. However, the bullish momentum faces risks. A failure to hold the $95,000 level would expose BTC to a retest of $92,000, another critical support. Losing both levels could trigger a significant correction, sending Bitcoin to lower demand zones around $85,000 or sub-$ sub-$80,000. This move would sharply reverse its recent rally, shaking market confidence. Related Reading: Cardano Transactions Rise To Multi-Year Highs – Metrics Support Bullish Outlook The coming days will be pivotal as traders watch for sustained support above $95,000.

In support of this optimism lies strong market enthusiasm and FOMO at the retail investor level. Because this excitement is building up, many are waiting to know whether Dogecoin might breach its current consolidation range. Market Sentiment & Technical Indicators People still think that Dogecoin will go up in value, and there are a number of important signs that back this view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61.86, which means that the price has stayed in the positive trend even though it has fallen from its previous highs. This could mean that the price will now settle down for a short time. Dogecoin’s price is also above its 50-, 100-, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), which supports the upward trend. However, attention needs to be focused on critical support levels. To continue on an upward path, Dogecoin will need to remain above $0.35 and penetrate resistance at $0.45. A successful breach could open the doors to higher price action and further cement a bullish narrative.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin (BTC) Crashes 33% In South Korea Amid Increasing Political Turmoil,2024-12-03 16:50:26+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a violent drop in South Korean exchanges amid the growing political crisis in the country. Following a recent announcement by the country’s President, the flagship crypto and other crypto assets saw a brief sell-off that plunged their prices by over 30%. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Could See A Correction Despite Historic Monthly Close, $400 Still On Sight? South Korea Declares First Martial Law In 44 Years On Tuesday night, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared an “emergency martial law” for the first time in 44 years, causing panic among Koreans and kickstarting a massive sell-off of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Korean JoongAng Daily explains that a declaration of martial law replaces civilian government with military rule and suspends civilian legal processes for military powers. Additionally, it allows measures like “restricting freedom of speech, publication, assembly and association, special changes to the authority of governments or courts, and a warrant system by the provisions of related laws.” Nonetheless, if the parliament requests the lifting of martial law, with the consent of a majority of its members, the president must do so. In a televised briefing, Yoon stated that the measure was taken to “eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.” The President accused the country’s opposition of sympathizing with North Korea and anti-state activities.  It’s worth noting that the opposition Democratic Party has a majority in the South Korean parliament, which has seemingly complicated Yoon’s efforts to push his agenda. In his statement, the Korean President didn’t announce specific measures but cited the opposition’s motion to impeach top prosecutors and reject the government’s budget proposal. Through this martial law, I will rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin. I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-Myung announced they would attempt to nullify Yoon’s order but expressed concern that the military forces would act against the parliament members. Bitcoin And XRP See Negative Kimchi Premium Following the news, the price of Bitcoin saw a sharp correction against its South Korean Won (KRW) pair in local exchanges, dropping 27% on Upbit, Korea’s largest crypto platform. The flagship cryptocurrency fell from the 132 million KRW mark, worth around $92,000, to as low as 88.26 million KRW, around $62,000. However, it has since recovered from the nosedive, trading again above the pre-crash levels. At the same time, Bitcoin recorded a price drop on global exchanges, falling momentarily below the $94,000 support before jumping back to the $95,000-$96,000 range on platforms like Binance, ByBit, and OKX. Similarly, XRP saw its price retrace 60% from the 4,000 KRW mark to as low as 1,623 KRW, worth around $1.23. The cryptocurrency has recovered from the fall in the last hour, trading at 3,600 KRW, valued at $2.52. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout According to Wu Blockchain, the reason behind the negative “Kimchi Premium” is that Korean exchanges do not allow institutional market makers. This, alongside the excessive traffic, “caused prices to be unable to synchronize in a short period of time.” Ultimately, the latest reports revealed that the Parliament passed the vote to nullify the martial law, ending it after three hours. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at 133.2 million KWR in Upbit. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout,2024-12-03 15:30:44+00:00,"Cardano could be the next to surge after XRP, as the ADA price shows signs of an imminent market recovery. A crypto analyst has projected that the ADA price could experience an epic breakout to $4.88 this bull cycle. The analyst has grounded his bullish prediction on the Cardano price action, providing insights into its potential future movements based on technical analysis and current market conditions. ADA Price Set Sights On $4.88 Alan Santana, a prominent TradingView analyst, has released a report declaring that additional price growth for Cardano is possible in this bull cycle. Sharing a detailed price chart of Cardano’s movements from 2021 to the present and its future price trajectory, the analyst projected a significant rise to $4.88 by 2026.  Related Reading: Fantom Price Breakout: Analyst Shares Anatomy Of FTM’s 18,000% Move To $150 By 2025 Alan Santana revealed that the ADA price has been in a long consolidation phase for 915 days since May 2022. Surprisingly, the popular altcoin had broken out of this range earlier this month, producing the highest bullish volume ever seen.  Cardano’s current market position indicates that it is steadily emerging from a market bottom, a development that often precedes a sustained upward trend. Alan Santana has underscored that Cardano’s recent trend shift is only the beginning, as the cryptocurrency has more room for growth in this bull cycle. Furthermore, the analyst revealed that the primary focus of his technical chart analysis is not to predict a new all-time high or determine how far up Cardano will reach by 2025. Instead, the analysis aims to highlight Cardano’s short-term price action based on a long-term chart.  Looking at his price chart, Alan Santana has pinpointed the 0.8875 Fibonacci level as the main support level for Cardano. This support was initially a resistance level ADA had conquered during last month’s bullish breakout. The analyst underscored that the breakout signified the highest level the ADA price had reached since May 2022. Alan Santana has predicted that if Cardano can break above the main support at 0.8875, the market sentiment will remain “super bullish,” and additional price growth should be expected. On the other hand, if Cardano fails to break the 0.8875 level, it could drop to a secondary support level at 0.6330.  If Cardano faces a retracement to 0.6330, the TradingView analyst has emphasized that the cryptocurrency’s overall market structure will still remain strong. These solid fundamentals have prompted the analyst to forecast a major rally to $2 for  ADA, if it can maintain a price above the 1.30 Fibonacci level.   Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $245,000? Here’s When You Should Be Expecting It Will Cardano Mirror XRP Price Surge?  Cardano is currently exhibiting potential that mirrors XRP, as the optimism surrounding the ongoing bull market could ignite a price surge for the ADA price. Since the beginning of the year, Cardano’s price has been stuck in a consolidated and declining state. This underperformance led to growing concerns among crypto members, with many labeling ADA a dead coin. However, with new signs of a potential price rally, Cardano could achieve XRP-like gains if market sentiment shifts in its favor. As of this writing, the price of XRP has been trading at $2.6 after surging by more than 428% in the past month.   Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Fresh Drop For Bitcoin: Will Bulls Defend $93,257 Once More?",2024-12-03 14:00:06+00:00,"Bitcoin has started a fresh decline, approaching the crucial $93,257 support level that has proven to be a battleground for bulls lately. Thus, the question remains whether buyers can regain control and defend this level once more. As uncertainty looms, all eyes are on this critical zone, which could determine whether Bitcoin bounces back or faces a deeper downward trajectory. With market volatility increasing, this article aims to delve into BTC’s renewed drop toward the $93,257 support level, assessing the likelihood of a bullish defense at this critical point. It examines technical patterns, market sentiment, and key levels to better gauge Bitcoin’s next price direction. Bitcoin Slides Back Toward $93,257 On the 4-hour chart, BTC exhibits negative sentiment, attempting to drop below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward, with its sight set at the $93,257 support level. Furthermore, a continued descent to this support suggests that selling pressure is intensifying, and if the support fails to hold, the asset could experience more declines. Also, an analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 44%, following a failed attempt to break above the 50% mark. This indicates a struggle to sustain upward momentum and points to moderate bearish pressure, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. If the RSI continues to drop, it may signal heightened selling activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Is Mirroring The Same Movements From 2023, Here’s What It Means On the daily chart, the crypto giant displays significant downside movement, highlighted by bearish candlesticks after a failed recovery attempt to surge toward its previous high of $99,575. The inability to sustain the previous uptrend implies a lack of buyer confidence and a prevailing pessimistic sentiment in the market. As Bitcoin aims at the $93,257 support level, the pressure from sellers could intensify, raising concerns about the possibility of a breakdown. Finally, the 1-day RSI indicates growing bearish momentum, with the signal line retreating to 62% from the overbought zone. This means that upside pressure is fading, and a shift in market sentiment may be underway. Given that the RSI continues to decline, it could signal a pullback or consolidation, with decreasing buying interest and the potential for bears to take control. Market Sentiment: Bulls Vs. Bears At $93,257 Bitcoin is currently aiming for a retest of the critical $93,257 support level, setting the stage for a battle between bulls and bears. If the bulls manage to defend this key level, BTC could begin to rise again, aiming for its previous high of $99,575. A successful breakout above this level could pave the way for a new all-time high. Related Reading: The Current Correction In Bitcoin Is The Last Before A Major Rally—Here’s Why However, should the bears dominate at this support level, Bitcoin could continue its decline toward the $85,211 mark. A break below this level might trigger more downside, pushing the price toward additional support zones. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,CryptoQuant CEO Warns Not To Short XRP Due To Insider Whale Activity,2024-12-03 12:30:22+00:00,"XRP has experienced an extraordinary surge in recent weeks, with its price skyrocketing by 380% over the past 23 days. In just the last four days, the price jumped 75%, reaching a peak of $2.87 on December 2. This rapid ascent appears to be fueled by significant buying activity from large investors, commonly known as “whales.” Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant, highlighted that these whales are primarily operating through the US based exchange Coinbase. On December 2, he pointed out that “Coinbase whales are driving this XRP rally,” noting that Coinbase’s minute-level price premium ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. In contrast, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—showed no significant premium, suggesting the buying pressure is predominantly originating from the United States. On his alternative X account (@kate_young_ju), Ki Young Ju hinted at possible insider activity influencing the market dynamics, stating, “Someone knew something.” Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says History Is Repeating Itself, Here’s How Today, he cautioned traders against shorting XRP. “Shorting XRP right now seems risky, imo. $25B XRP deposit before the pump might look like market manipulation but could simply be front-running. This insider whale might know something extremely bullish about XRP, such as spot ETF approval,” he speculated. He further shared a chart “XRP: Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge (Spot & Futures), which indicates that retail trading activity for XRP has surpassed the highs of 2021 and is nearing levels last seen in January 2018, when XRP reached its all-time high of $3.92. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s What He Means Observing the one-year cumulative volume delta (CVD) of taker buy/sell volume, he remarked: “1-year CVD of Taker Buy/Sell Volume for XRP shows a historic rebound. Whales are aggressively using market orders, driving overwhelming demand.” A 700% Rallye Incoming For XRP Against BTC? From a technical analysis perspective, crypto analyst Jacob Canfield emphasizes the importance of examining the XRP/BTC pairing. He notes that XRP is currently at a critical resistance zone on the BTC pair chart (XRPBTC), having just reached the $2.75 level on the USDT pair—a resistance point since December 2019. Canfield suggests that a breakout here could signal a potential 240% move back to key resistance zones from 2017, 2018, and 2019. “If we get real FOMO, then we could be setting up for another 700% move to all-time high against Bitcoin,” he commented, acknowledging the “two of the strongest monthly candles for XRP that we’ve seen in over 5 years.” Looking at shorter time-frames of the XRP/USD pair, Canfield highlights the utility of support and resistance levels to identify new entry points in these time frames. “In bull markets, you need to use low time frame support/resistance to find new entries. 5 min/15 min are the best. XRP as an example – $2.20 was the clear S/R invalidation. Base of the biggest green candle = base of impulse. Usually the best place to re-enter a trade.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.63.

Reddit,solana,13 Days Into Copy Trading Solana Wallets,2024-12-03 19:28:19,"Here are my results copy trading solana wallets. Starting with 5 Sol.

- Day 1: 5 Sol

- Day 2: 4.3 Sol

- Day 3: 3.1 Sol

- Day 4: 2.4 Sol

- Day 5: 2.5 Sol 

- Day 6: 2.8 Sol

- Day 7: 1.9 Sol 

- Day 8: 2.4 Sol

- Day 9: 3.5 Sol

- Day 10: 6.2 Sol

- Day 11: 9.0 Sol

- Day 12: 16.6 Sol

- Day 13(now): 15.4 Sol


I was about to give up a week into it. 

It is not as straight forward as I initially thought. 

Most valuable lessons so far:

- GMGN does not give the full picture. You don’t see their unrealized gains. Where most losses are hidden. 

- Ideal win rate is between 50% and 70%. 
ROI is more important than Win Rate! 

- Test new wallets for 1 day with trade size 0.1 sol before increasing it to 0.25 minimum! As trading fees will eat up all your profits unless you get +100% return if you keep it at 0.1

- Learn to read and use Solscan

- Stay away from wallets that are holding tokens for less than 2 minutes! Even if they are making big money. Because these will drain you QUICK!! 

- Set copy buy limit per hour per wallet to 2. 

- Find your own wallets to copy. Never trust any group or service. 


I wrote a script that analyzed over 7 million wallets this is what I found: 

- 0.6% are profitable from defi activities. That’s about 42k wallets. 

- Most of these wallets are bots that hold tokens for less than 2 minutes. 

- Only about 3k wallets in the entire Solana blockchain consistently make money in Defi activities. 

- less than 600 wallets make over 1,000% per week in defi activities that I personally deem safe to copy. 

- The common denominator in these 600 wallets is that they ALL deposit sol into their wallets using a DEX exchange/bridge. 

- They transfer their sol back to the exchange and start with a fresh wallet every 5-7 days. 

I have to constantly manage the wallets and check on their performance because they keep withdrawing out their profits and sometimes they occasionally farm you if you copy for too long. 

I really hope that I am finally on to something. I am completely obsessed with hunting and managing wallets now 😂

I shall report back in 30 days. ",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,solana,creating a pumpfun alternative with anti-rug systems + many other improvements,2024-12-03 04:23:54,"hey everyone,

as a team of small traders and devs, we’ve spent a lot of time in the trenches of solana. we loved the concept of pumpfun — it brought so much hype in this space and Solana wouldn't be what it is today without it. there’s no doubt it created countless millionaires and changed the game in many ways.

still, the balance is heavily tilted against the majority. most people lose money, fall victim to rugs, get scammed by malicious devs, or simply end up in projects designed to fail. it’s frustrating to see, especially when so much of it could be avoided with better systems in place. it feels like these problems are being overlooked while bad actors keep abusing the system.

that’s why, a few months ago, we started our journey to build [pix.fun](http://pix.fun/) . our goal isn’t to compete with pumpfun or claim we’re better, that’s not the point. instead, we want to address the issues that traders face every day and make solana’s meme ecosystem stronger, safer, and more enjoyable for everyone.

PixFun is just like pumpfun, but comes with a suite of new features, including:

**- anti-rug systems:** devs can’t nuke the chart or pull liquidity all at once. we have a system that can detect when a TX has malicious intent behind so he won't be able to ""dump""

**- devs score:** each dev on the platform will have a rating, based on how their coins perform and their trustworthiness, this will include several metrics such as the percentage of their supply they’ve sold and other token data

**- warnings** if a dev is holding too much supply

**- leaderboard system:** we’re rewarding the most dedicated users on the platform, with metrics like volume traded and referrals and overall activity. wallets can remain anonymous if users choose

**- green and red flags on projects**, meant to help rookie traders

**- moderated chats:** project chats will be free and open, meaning devs can’t delete comments. however there'll be moderation and some filters so its not a spamfest

**- referral system:** you can earn up to 45% from the fees of users you refer to the platform (3 levels)

**- a quest system** that will enable users to perform tasks (such as twitter engagement) and earn platform points / airdrops

***+ many more under work.***

oh, and we got livestreams (promise they won't be **that wild**)

one of our users suggested something the other day and it's already under works — enabling devs to open a voice chat for their token directly on the platform.

So many new people are joining crypto daily only to get scammed, lose all their money, and leave. No one can ever truly fix that, but I'm damn sure we can improve this aspect by far.

will we encounter challenges? absolutely. but we’re committed to working with the community every step of the way and make this platform everything it needs to be.

Thanks for reading through and I'm here to answer any of your question! Also if there's any suggestion here that resonates with our vision, it will be implemented by the our team with the speed of light!",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,solana,"NanoGPT (access AI with SOL) update: system prompts, UX, more models, payment stats",2024-12-03 06:33:46,"Lots of changes since our most recent update!

[NanoGPT update](https://preview.redd.it/b6tfd6zuok4e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=099532bffb23b498ac2ef0d001a73151550a7801)

# UX improvements:

\- It's now possible to add a **system prompt** (for all models except Claude/Gemini ones)

\- There's a **dark/light mode switch** next to new chat

\- **Export chats** as PDF or Markdown by appending ?export=pdf or =md to the URL

\- ALT + C for new chat, ALT + I for new image (Option C and Option I on Mac)

# New models:

\- **Qwen QwQ 32b** is Alibaba's answer to OpenAI's o1-preview. It ""thinks"", and only starts outputting later.

\- OpenAI and Google released about 4 **new versions of ChatGPT/Gemini**, to constantly overtake each other on the leaderboards (we immediately push their newest version live every time). Google also released LearnLM, a model focused specifically on helping people learn new skills, which of course we added.

\- Alibaba's **Qwen Max, Qwen Large, Qwen Long and Qwen Turbo** have been added, very low prices and up to 10m token context. Almost no other provider offers these models.

\- **Step-2-16k**, another Chinese model, is also pretty much only available through us. It scores extremely well on the LiveBench comparison, and is very popular in China.

\- **Mistral Large** and a *ton* of open-source models got added. These include many Roleplay/Storytelling models (more on that below) and **two ""abliterated"" models**, versions of models that have been finetuned to remove limitations and biases. They're uncensored versions, essentially.

# Cool integrations:

\- **SillyTavern** is an open-source front-end that many people use for roleplaying. Dylan was kind enough to do a pull request and add us in, so we're now natively supported and suddenly have a lot more users that are interested in roleplaying models, hence also the additions.

\- **""battleofcoins.com""** lets you pick crypto, pick models, and have the AIs discuss and debate which one is best over multiple rounds. Very fun implementation, you can pick any selection criteria you want.

# More:

\- We added lots of additional payment methods: **Binance Pay, Coinbase Wallet**, ETH + L2s, and a lot more. This is likely the last additions we did for a while there, since anything else feels like diminishing returns.

\- We released **payment stats** on how much the different crypto were used. I'll add this into a comment because I'm afraid links will get the post removed. **SOL** accounted for only a very small percentage surprisingly, we think it's mostly because we haven't been able to reach out to the community well so far. We know there are people that have built us into their on-chain bots, but we'd love to see more of it!



Also important for many of you: we have a working branch with file uploads. It can take excel files, pdfs, documents etc. We want to release it as soon as possible but it's also a change that needs quite a bit of testing, so we don't want to push it too soon and get people annoyed at how badly it works. 

Any questions I'm all ears!",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,solana,New routes between Solana and VinuChain,2024-12-03 07:46:18,"A few exciting updates for Solana users! 
VinuChain is now more connected to Solana than ever! Wanchain has deployed new bridges allowing users to transfer a number of assets across these to chains such as:

- VINU: VinuChain ↔️ Solana
- USDT: VinuChain ↔️ Solana
- USDC: VinuChain ↔️ Solana
- SOL: VinuChain ↔️ Solana

What Makes VinuChain Special?

- Feeless Transactions: Unlike most blockchains, VinuChain offers a determinably feeless experience.
- Scalability: Built on a DAG ledger structure, VinuChain ensures lightning-fast and highly scalable performance.

Why This Matters for Solana Users:
- Enhanced Liquidity: With these new routes, trading and swapping on Solana becomes even more efficient.
- Expanding Opportunities: Now you can tap into the unique advantages of both ecosystems.

Reddit,solana,Altcoin Season Website,2024-12-02 12:26:46,"Hello all,

I have been in the tech and crypto scene for a bit and found that it is difficult to track the key indicators all in one place. 

So, for fun I’ve created the following site that gauges if we are in an alt season or not using the typical indicators.

It utilizes the CoinGecko API and TradingView charts.

I wanted to share it with you all to see if you had any feedback or caught anything I had missed.

The first issue you will notice is the values on the card do not match the charts. This is because CoinGecko returns the values and TradingView does the charts. The only fix is to create my own charts but that means I need to purchase CoinGeckos Pro API which costs a lot of money lol. However, the values are off by only a few percent and should still be dependable.

Please feel free to give me feedback on the site!

If you have any questions about the logic performed on the data, please visit the source code linked at the bottom of the website.

Reddit,solana,SOLANA INFLATION WARNING ,2024-12-02 21:49:11,"I'd like to preface this post by saying that it is based off the assumption that 99% of Solana holders are looking for asset price appreciation as opposed to buying the asset strictly because of the tech.

With that being said,

I came across an extremely interesting discovery yesterday. Solanas market cap has almost doubled from the highs set in 2021... and the token price is trading at a 10% discount to its 2021 highs.

How did this happen?
    
It's clearly the minting of new Sol that's bebased holders drastically but more importantly, why isn't the price going up now? The answer, as crazy as it sounds, is because the price didn't keep going up enough to outperform the market.

If you bought Solana at the end of 2022 and sold it all at $240 dollars in march, the thought of token inflation didn't even enter your mind although it was clearly happening at dramatic rates. Why would you even consider inflation? Your asset was outperforming the entire market for over a year. Only a fool that fumbled their bag would claim that it has reckless inflation.

My theory is that assets holders don't (and maybe even shouldn't) care about debasement if their asset is outperforming the market. It only becomes a problem when the asset goes through say 3- 6 months of relative underperformance. Then the spotlight moves from asset price, to a narrative that hopefully rationalizes the relative underperformance. In Solanas case, the narrative for relative underperformance couldn't be more detrimental. 

So I have a question and a challenge for my fellow redditors. 

The question is; would you buy an investment vehicle thats market cap has doubled in three years while the price has stayed the same? 

The challenge is to find the word inflation one time in Solanas whitepaper.

And just so y'all know, the whitepaper the Solana devs sent to CoinMarketCap doesn't even mention Solana. It's just a breakdown of the consensus mechanism lol

Best of luck to all readers!

Staying decentralized is really important to me—I want to keep full control over my funds and avoid any unnecessary KYC or middlemen.

I’ve already explored a few options, like PortalBridge and deBridge, but neither of them seem to support Bitcoin. It feels like most bridges and decentralized platforms tend to overlook BTC, which is surprising given how widely used it is.

So, here’s where I’m stuck: is there a reliable and decentralized way to swap BTC for SOL directly? Maybe something involving wrapped tokens or another creative workaround? I’d love to hear from anyone who’s faced a similar issue or knows the best path forward.

Poseidon is a new transpiler framework that empowers web developers to create Solana on-chain programs (i.e., smart contracts) using only TypeScript, a language familiar to millions worldwide. The framework significantly lowers the barrier to entry for on-chain development, making Solana more accessible to a broader audience of developers. Poseidon translates TypeScript code directly into Anchor, Solana's most widely adopted program framework.

This article will delve into Poseidon's origins, architectural design, key features, and potential positive impact on the Solana development landscape. Additionally, we’ll walk through a practical example of a simple token vault program written with Poseidon, highlighting some of the framework's capabilities.

Above: Data quantifying the prevalence of JavaScript (62.3%) and TypeScript (38.5%) among developers (source).

## Background

Toward the end of 2023, the [**Turbin3**](https://turbin3.com/) team was approached by the Solana Foundation with an ambitious challenge: “Can you build a framework that enables developers to create Solana programs using TypeScript?” Naturally, the first response was to ask, “Why?”

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps developers catch errors earlier and write more maintainable code. As the de facto standard for modern web development, TypeScript and JavaScript have cultivated one of the largest developer communities globally. Introducing program development in TypeScript presents a significant opportunity to expand the pool of new Solana developers and lower the entry barriers to building on the blockchain.

*Above: Data quantifying the prevalence of JavaScript (62.3%) and TypeScript (38.5%) among developers (*[***source***](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/)*).*

 

Mastering Solana program development is challenging compared to many other blockchains. New developers must tackle the dual hurdles of understanding [**Solana's accounts model**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/the-solana-programming-model-an-introduction-to-developing-on-solana) and learning Rust simultaneously, which can be a steep learning curve. We at Turbin3 know this better than anyone; [**15% of all new Solana developers come through our programs**](https://x.com/jacobvcreech/status/1825715914706149539?t=4mnn04oh0hc_Vjip6Dq4LQ).

By introducing a TypeScript framework, developers can decouple these challenges, leveraging a language they already know to deploy their first programs to the testnet faster. A TypeScript-based framework for on-chain program development allows developers to build full-stack Solana applications in a single language seamlessly for the first time.

## The Solution: Poseidon

The project began as a basic types library and transpiler concept but quickly grew into something far more robust after initial prototyping and thorough feedback from Solana and TypeScript experts. After months of building, testing, troubleshooting, and receiving invaluable input from industry experts, Poseidon reached a critical milestone earlier this year at Breakpoint 2024, where we unveiled our work to an audience of curious developers. 

‍

In a live presentation. [**Shrinath**](https://github.com/ShrinathNR), our lead developer of Poseidon demonstrated writing a Solana program in TypeScript. With a single build command, Poseidon transpiles the TypeScript code into full Anchor syntax—right before the audience’s eyes. The room buzzed with excitement, and whispers spread: “Could this really work?”

Since then, [**Poseidon’s open-source repository**](https://github.com/Turbin3/poseidon) has grown rapidly, driven by contributions from our growing Poseidon Army on X and Discord. Community members have tackled issues, submitted pull requests, and collaborated on building new packages, helping Poseidon mature daily. Improvements include an enhanced CLI, added support for token program functions, and better error messaging. Though still in its early stages, Poseidon’s potential is undeniable.

From a technical standpoint, we look at the trajectory of Poseidon's development in four stages. We faced some key decisions after our original calls, brainstorming, and architectural designs. Most notably: 

* Making assumptions about the libraries needed
* Account derivations in the instruction body by chaining methods
* Procedural macros (a new concept for many developers)

Then we worked heads down through the building and iteration stage leading up to the Breakpoint unveiling.  That moment of reveal, with tremendous aplomb, opened the floodgate to the current stage- we have put the framework in the hands of early adopters to tinker, discover and improve upon it.

As we wrap up 2024, we continue to nurture the framework's growth, focusing on core functionality improvements, community involvement for extending support, and identifying needed SPL functions and Anchor library support. These aims will allow the leading developers to focus on core improvements.

Looking ahead to 2025, we’re accelerating development by launching our first Turbin3 Poseidon Cohort in late Q1 (announcement soon). This initiative will advance the framework and focus on creating public packages, tutorials, and other educational resources. The goal is clear: make Poseidon the definitive tool for fast-tracking Solana program development with TypeScript.

## Key Features

Poseidon offers several standout features:

* **Simplified Development:** A TypeScript-based interface minimizes the learning curve for web developers, enabling them to concentrate on application logic instead of grappling with Rust
* **Increased Productivity:** Poseidon empowers developers to work more efficiently by utilizing familiar tools and workflows, accelerating the development process
* **Enhanced Security and Performance:** The framework ensures that the transpiled Rust code aligns with Solana's rigorous security and performance standards, maintaining the integrity of on-chain programs
* **Seamless Integration:** Poseidon integrates seamlessly with the Solana ecosystem, allowing developers to leverage existing tools and libraries

## System Architecture

Poseidon's architecture comprises several key components:

* **TypeScript-based Programming Interface:** This layer provides a familiar syntax and tooling for developers to write Solana programs
* **Transpilation Engine:** This engine converts TypeScript code into equivalent Rust code, leveraging the power of TypeScript's type system and language features
* **Anchor Code Generation:** The transpiled Rust code is further processed to generate valid Anchor programs, which can be compiled and deployed to the Solana network
* **Account Management:** Poseidon provides a streamlined way to manage accounts and their associated data, making interacting with the Solana blockchain easier

## Use Cases

Poseidon is designed to accelerate developers' understanding of the Solana accounts model, significantly reducing the time for new developers to deploy their first programs to the testnet. **Due to the stringent security demands of blockchain applications, Poseidon is not suitable today for building production-grade mainnet applications**. Aspiring Solana protocol engineers will ultimately need to learn Anchor and Rust to understand Solana's underlying architecture better.

The framework can be used to explore and experiment with a wide range of decentralized applications, including:

* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Develop innovative financial applications such as lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and yield farming platforms
* **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):** Create and manage digital assets on the Solana blockchain
* **Gaming:** Develop blockchain-based games and virtual worlds
* **Supply Chain Management:** Track and verify the provenance of products and materials

We focused first on foundational programs that underpin nearly every blockchain application: Counter, Vault, and Escrow. These core building blocks are the basis for countless protocols, making them the perfect starting point.

## Sample Poseidon Program

Let’s dive into the code and examine in detail an [**example vault program built in TypeScript**](https://github.com/Turbin3/poseidon/blob/master/examples/vault/typescript/vault.ts) with Poseidon, breaking down the program into its composite parts. The complete code for this program and others can be found in the [**Poseidon GitHub repository**](https://github.com/Turbin3/poseidon/tree/master/examples).

### Imports and Program Declaration

The program is defined as a TypeScript class with a static **PROGRAM\_ID** specifying the program ID. The u/solanaturbine**/poseidon** package provides the necessary types for defining instructions, such as Rust types (**u8**, **u64**, **i8**, **i128**, **boolean**, **string**), SPL types (**Pubkey**, **AssociatedTokenAccount**, **Mint**, **TokenAccount**, **TokenProgram**) and Anchor account types (**Signer**, **UncheckedAccount**, **SystemAccount**).

    import { Account, Pubkey, Result, Signer, SystemAccount, SystemProgram, UncheckedAccount, u64, u8 } from ""@solanaturbine/poseidon"";
    
    export default class VaultProgram {
        static PROGRAM_ID = new Pubkey(""11111111111111111111111111111111"");

### Instructions

We typically define methods inside the program class to define instructions with Poseidon. The context for each instruction is implicit in the method parameters. To define an account as a program derived address (PDA) with u/solanaturbine**/poseidon**, we use the **derive** method to specify the seed as the first parameter within an array.

        initialize(
            owner: Signer,
            state: Vault,
            auth: UncheckedAccount,
            vault: SystemAccount
        ): Result {
            
            auth.derive(['auth', state.key])
            state.derive(['state', owner.key]).init(owner)
            vault.derive(['vault', auth.key])
    
            // assign an argument of type Pubkey by calling the key property
            state.owner = owner.key;
    
            // to store bumps in the custom_Acc(state), we can simply call getBump
            state.stateBump = state.getBump()
            state.authBump = auth.getBump()
            state.vaultBump = vault.getBump()
        }
    
        deposit(
            owner: Signer,
            state: Vault,
            auth: UncheckedAccount,
            vault: SystemAccount,
            amount: u64
        ) {
            state.deriveWithBump(['state', owner.key], state.stateBump)
            auth.deriveWithBump(['auth', state.key], state.authBump)
            vault.deriveWithBump(['vault', auth.key], state.vaultBump)
    
    
            SystemProgram.transfer(
                owner, // from
                vault, // to
                amount // amount to be sent
            )
        }
    
        withdraw(
            owner: Signer,
            state: Vault,
            auth: UncheckedAccount,
            vault: SystemAccount,
            amount: u64
        ) {        
            state.deriveWithBump(['state', owner.key], state.stateBump)
            auth.deriveWithBump(['auth', state.key], state.authBump)
            vault.deriveWithBump(['vault', auth.key], state.vaultBump)
    
            SystemProgram.transfer(
                vault,
                owner,
                amount,
                ['vault', state.key, state.authBump]
            )
        }
    }
    

### Account State

Custom state accounts are defined as an interface that extends **Account**. The fields of the custom state account can be defined using types from the u/solanaturbine**/Poseidon** package.

    export interface Vault extends Account {
        owner: Pubkey
        stateBump: u8
        authBump: u8
        vaultBump: u8
    }

Reddit,solana,Holding / Bot strategy,2024-12-02 12:22:15,"I've been using **BullX**, and it works perfectly overall. However, the authentication via Telegram-only bothers me. Plus, I recently bought a token that I plan to hold longer, but BullX doesn’t allow direct withdrawals of the token itself—only Solana.

I’m rethinking my strategy. As someone leaning toward mid-term holding for memecoins, I’m torn:

* Should I stick with **Proton/BullX**?
* Or move to my **Phantom Wallet**?

The challenge with Phantom is that I use a **Ledger**, and signing transactions during high-activity periods could slow me down.

For those of you trading memecoins on a slightly longer time horizon (not minute-to-minute but not HODLing forever), what tools or platforms do you prefer?

Also, when the bag starts to grow, what strategies or solutions help you manage the increased complexity effectively?

Reddit,solana,Buy Solana for zero fees.,2024-12-02 00:20:58,"So I wanted to make a thread about this for a while now, not sure it’s been covered in this subreddit but here it goes. I have discovered the way to buy solana for near zero fees, possibly even 0 if done correctly.

It starts with buying PYUSD on PayPal. You will need to kyc but this is very worth it.

Using a debit card, you can buy and send PYUSD instantly with the solana network.

Now here is where you will be paying a very small fee or zero fees.

For zero fees:
Buy PYUSD on PayPal with debit card, send it instantly to phantom, swap to solana using Raydium or Jupiter, only kicker is you will need a small amount of solana already in the wallet for the swap fees. Around $2-$5 in sol is perfect. Once you swap your PYUSD for SOL you will see you paid no fees for purchase and only a micro fee for swap through phantom.

For near zero fees:
Buy PYUSD on PayPal with debit card, send it instantly to exodus wallet (you will need to add PYUSD to list of tokens on your exodus, do this by pressing “add more” and find PYUSD then use that receiving address) . From there, use their swap feature (must use vpn for this as they don’t support a lot of the states in the USA.) and swap into solana. Then transfer the swapped solana to phantom. You will see you paid a very small fee for the swap but no need to pay for more swap fees on phantom.

There you have it, no more paying crazy fees for buying solana (I’m looking at you CEX.io).

If you have any questions, leave in thread, I’ll try to get to them asap.

Happy trading frens.

I want to share this post to warn you to be cautious about the projects you invest in on r/Solana via Phantom Wallet.

Last night, my Phantom Wallet was completely emptied without any action on my part. The only thing I had done with this wallet was invest in meme coins, and I hadn’t touched it for over 20 days.

This makes me wonder if there might be malicious code in some of these lesser-known meme coin projects designed to drain wallets.

I don’t use this Phantom Wallet very often, which makes this situation even more concerning as I have no idea how it happened. If anyone here has expert knowledge or insights, I would greatly appreciate your advice.

In the meantime, I urge everyone to be extra careful when using Phantom Wallet and to think twice before interacting with such projects.

Stay safe, and thank you all! 🙏",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,ethereum,Sent ETH from an old Binance account to Robinhood on the wrong network? Is it really lost??,2024-12-02 22:50:54,"Hello! Last night I went through the process of digging up my old Binance account from 2017 to see if my crypto had gone up recently and I had about $1600! I was excited, but wanted it out of there and into one single platform (also, it was NOT Binance US, so I couldn't do anything but withdraw). I was happy to find it easy and I transferred my Ripple to Robinhood no problem. The Network option said ""Automatically match the Network"" and everything went through quickly. That was worth $600. Then I tried my $1k worth of ETH and the Network option didn't say ""Automatically match"" and I had to choose 1 of 4 options. With no explanation of the differences, I looked at the transaction prices and transfer times and chose the cheapest fee, Arbitrum. Nothing on Robinhood or Binance gave me warning that I need to pick the CORRECT network. I only found out after digging deeper on Robinhood to find that it doesn't accept transfers from other networks. Everything from customer service on both ends says it's lost forever. And googling also tells me so. Any help here would be appreciated. And if it's lost forever, I want to know for sure before I give up. Thanks",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Base is seeing a surge in transactions on the network.  
This increased demand  had an impact on transactions success rate, which have declined from \~90% to close to 70%.  
This surge has also driven a significant rise in L2 revenue and profits. Despite the increased cost of blobs reducing L2 profit margins from \~99% to 90%, Base generated $4M in L2 profits last week alone.

There's so much clients to manage your digital assets that I'm genuinely curious: **what are the tools/wallets you use everyday to manage your web3 journey?**

Underlying questions:
- what clients (wallets) do you use? On desktop? On your mobile?
- for those who use a smart wallet account (like [Safe](https://safe.global) ), what do you use? How is it configured?
- if you use several addresses across several chains (including L2), how do you keep track of all your funds and NFTs?
- do you use a aggregator like Zerion or Zapper?
- etc.

Whatever, I'm just curious about what you use everyday to send transactions, manage your assets (cryptos and assets), manage your smart accounts, etc.

Reddit,ethereum,Is there information on number of users of ETH and all chains/tokens that build on it?,2024-11-28 12:51:48,"So, I'm curious - and genuinely open minded - how the total number of users of Ethereum PLUS those using all tokens or higher layers that depend build on it - whatever - compares to the figures I can see in the Bitcoin (BTC) environment regarding its estimated number of users and also what can be deduced about self-custodial usage from its blockchain.

I got this question because of the talk about ""strategic reserves"" and I'm not hearing politicians talk about an ""ETH reserve"" despite my impression that actual _usage_ by actual individual _people_ is potentially higher on the wider-utility focused ETH than on the ""digital gold"" BTC blockchain.

I know such numbers can only ever be approximated, but I am interested in whatever information to which the community can point me.

Reddit,ethereum,Beam chain: what’s next?,2024-11-27 13:21:39,"**The Beam Chain was introduced publicly by Justin Drake, an Ethereum researcher, at DevCon 2024 two weeks ago**. This highly anticipated announcement sparked mixed reactions: some met it with excitement, while others expressed skepticism.

**But, what’s next?**

At this stage, we’re waiting for the official proposal and technical specifications, which could take time to finalize.

Meanwhile, discussions around the Beam Chain are intensifying, and it's essential to address some of the concerns.

One key point raised is the argument that **we could continue without the Beam Chain** 🤔

However, it’s crucial to remember that the Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) is 5 already years old. Yes, it’s a lot! In a nutshell, the CL has become outdated. It has accumulated technical debt and is not utilizing some of the latest innovations, such as Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs.

The Beam Chain introduction presents an opportunity to address this backlog, perform necessary upgrades, and clean up Ethereum’s tech debt all in one go. As Justin Drake mentioned, a primary reason for this overhaul is to reduce the technological debt that has built up on the Beacon Chain over the past five years.

*Note:* The Beam Chain does not change Ethereum’s roadmap but rather consolidates upcoming changes into a unified proposal with a batch upgrade.

Read more [in my recent thread](https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1856687548694720933).

Another significant concern is **the 5-year timeline for the Beam Chain implementation**. Many argue that five years is too long.

However, Justin Drake clarified that Ethereum will continue to receive regular updates throughout this period. The Beam Chain fork itself will occur after five years of constant updates to Ethereum.

**But why five years?** Ethereum currently supports hundreds of billions of dollars in assets, TVL, and thousands of dApps. This immense ecosystem requires careful planning and testing to ensure a smooth rollout to the mainnet. This is a hard rationale to argue with.

Also it’s important to note that the Beam Chain is still a proposal. It’s highly likely that changes will be made to the initial design before it ossifies. Thus, it is a great opportunity for everyone to engage in the Ethereum governance and share your thoughts on the Beam Chain.

**The proposal is open for discussion** — the more reasoned opinions and inputs we have, the better the chance we can shape the best solution for Ethereum's future!",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

you can peek over the fence and see what the bitcoin ecosystem is doing. their wallet apps are gradually shifting over to the satoshi as the default and primary denomination. they are starting to say things like ""a dollar is worth 1000 satoshi,"" or ""I paid ten thousand sats for that."" that's easier to conceptualize and people will like it better in the long run.

Here's how it works.

>In a cowswap pseudo sandwich, mev bots are monitoring cowswap auction data, front running users before the auctions are completed... then selling after the auction is completed.

>It's not as great as a traditional sandwich bc it's a multiblock operation / bots do carry inventory risk... but when you know the future (what people are about to buy), it's pretty solid edge.

Reddit,ethereum,How to auto invest paycheck into crypto?,2024-11-25 23:20:36,"Hello Everyone,

I’m looking to invest a portion of my W2 Salary every month into a crypto portfolio.

To preface I’m still starting out with crypto so apologies if I say something dumb.

Every month on the 30th, I get my W2 direct deposit. I recently decided I’d like to take a small portion (let’s say 5%) and have it equally distributed across 5-10 coins I choose from.

Examples are: BTC, ETH, XRP, UNI, LINK, ADA, DOT.

If I invest let’s say $1,000 every month, I would want it equally divided by the amount of coins in the portfolio. For example in this example $1,000 / 8 = $125.

So $125 coins into every coin on the 30th every month. And it just keeps doing this automatically every month without me managing it. Similar to savings accounts, ira, etc.

Is there a way to do so? Which platform is best to do this that ideally has the least fees as I’ll be doing this monthly for several coins. Is there a preferred platform for this type of crypto investing? So far I’m looking at Kraken Pro.

Thank you all for your help in advance! 😊

TLDR; Looking for platform to auto invest direct deposit salary into crypto portfolio across several coins I choose.

Enough that I threw in some dollars and kind of just never let my ETH's go since 2016, a small DCA and then discipline to forget about it. I remember at some point ETH2 really sketched me out, and at one point I was nose keep in the literature and really understood the mechanics of it. Because of ETH, I am independently wealthy and pursue my career/passions without restrictions. My family is forever thankful for buying into the *Vision* of ETH.

Grown up the last 9 years, and am super thankful for learning about these communities early in my life. But I have also lived in the real world, work in technology / cybersecurity, even employed at a fintech company that implemented a crypto currency adjacent technology for ledger tracking and tokenization enabled workloads - but it was 100% isolated, private, and used by the company - for the company - built on top of a fork of a now popular cryptocurrency.

From a real world applied problem solving standpoint, I'm not stuck on either of the following questions - independently, I have strong answers. But together, I simply don't.

Which leads me to the following:

1. What problem does ethereum solve, AND
2. How is solving that problem going to lead to a financial gain or profit in holding ETH

There is the *Vision* of Etherum, and then there is the *Applied* nature of Ethereum in the real world outside of internet forums, discord, trading apps and reddit.

Honestly, I don't think the answer in solving these problems leads to ETH becoming more valuable. In fact, I think the opposite is true - the value would either:

have to stabilize and maintain a very low price for adoption , or , the application of ETH would be by private blockchains running completely independently from the main net, and businesses, corporations and government institutions peering and partnering between each other.

Not looking to delve (yes, ChatGPT has taught me new words) into speculation and pricing and current market hysteria. That is for children.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum: The Beautiful Death of Agility,2024-11-24 21:59:52,"*This post is taking part in the Devconflict_x Kiwi writing contest.*

The Ethereum community stands at a crossroads, yet it may not even realize it. Caught in the dazzling momentum of innovation, collaboration, and evolution, we risk forgetting the very foundation upon which this project was built: resilience. In our pursuit of agility, we may lose sight of a truth so fundamental it feels almost sacrilegious to say aloud:

**Ethereum needs to die to truly live.**

Not literally, of course, but in spirit. To fulfill its promise as the ""Internet of Value,"" Ethereum must embrace ossification as its ultimate goal. The base layer should become boring, invisible, and irrelevant to daily conversation—not because it has failed, but because it has succeeded so completely that it no longer requires attention. The irony is sharp: the greatest triumph of a decentralized system is the irrelevance of its community.

**The Case for Ossification**

Imagine a world where no one argues over the TCP/IP stack anymore. Why? Because it works. It's reliable, unchanging, and trusted to the point of invisibility. Ethereum should aspire to this state: a protocol so stable and robust that its functionality is no longer debated, no longer tinkered with, and no longer the subject of headlines. The innovation and experimentation we celebrate today belong elsewhere—to layer 2s, to applications, to higher abstractions that build upon the rock-solid foundation of Ethereum’s base layer.

Ossification isn’t just a technical necessity; it’s a moral imperative. Blockchain technology was born in hostile environments, designed to resist attack and inspire trust. Every change, every EIP, every tweak to the core protocol introduces risk—new surfaces for attack, new opportunities for exploitation. Trust isn’t built on agility. It’s built on stability. Ethereum’s long-term viability depends on its ability to stop changing.

And yet, the community seems hesitant. We cling to our roles as developers, researchers, and moderators. We celebrate the vibrant discourse and constant evolution of the protocol. But this beautiful collaboration, as precious as it is, must eventually end. Not in failure, but in transformation. The Ethereum of the future will thrive not because we’re actively improving it, but because it no longer needs improvement.

**Community and the Fear of Irrelevance**

This transformation requires an existential reckoning for the community. The moderators, developers, and active participants who shape Ethereum today must confront an uncomfortable truth: their work is temporary. Ossification means fewer EIPs, less debate, and, ultimately, a shrinking community. But this isn’t a cause for alarm—it’s a sign of success.

When activity on forums decline, when user engagement wanes, when the vibrant culture around Ethereum fades into the background, we shouldn’t mourn. We should celebrate. These are the growing pains of maturity, the inevitable consequence of becoming “good enough.”

But the current culture resists this idea. Moderators worry about declining engagement. Developers push for agility over stability. The community as a whole clings to its relevance. This resistance isn’t just a barrier to ossification—it’s a denial of Ethereum’s destiny.

**Automating Governance: A Path Forward**

One way to confront this resistance is by leading through example. The Ethereum community, with its emphasis on decentralization and trustless systems, is uniquely positioned to pioneer a new approach to governance—one that relies not on human discretion, but on automation.

Imagine a world where moderation on platforms like Reddit is handled not by humans but by large language models (LLMs). These models, trained on transparent and community-approved guidelines, could analyze every post and comment, assign confidence scores, and act based on predefined thresholds. This system wouldn’t ban users out of emotion or bias but based on clear, consistent criteria. Every action would be explained, every decision traceable. Moderators would shift from enforcers to observers, fine-tuning the system rather than wielding power.

This isn’t just a pipe dream—it’s achievable with today’s technology. Implementing such systems would set a powerful precedent, demonstrating how decentralized, automated governance can outperform traditional, centralized methods. It could serve as a model not just for Ethereum, but for political and social systems worldwide.

**The Death of Agility, the Birth of Trust**

Ossification isn’t the end of Ethereum—it’s the beginning of its true potential. By becoming boring, Ethereum becomes reliable. By fading into the background, it becomes indispensable. And by embracing its own irrelevance, the community ensures that Ethereum’s impact will endure long after the debates have ended and the developers have moved on.

The question isn’t whether Ethereum can remain agile—it’s whether it has the courage to stop. To become boring. To die beautifully, so that the world it supports can thrive.

This isn’t just a technical argument. It’s a call to the soul of the community. Can we let go of what we’ve built so that it can live beyond us? Can we embrace the death of the Ethereum we know, to give birth to the Ethereum the world needs?",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,ethereum,"Controlling the fee on Ethereum (Metamask, nodes and Etherscan) is just a nightmare - Is this a bug?",2024-11-22 08:39:51,"I'm not happy with how this went, but I wouldn't call this a rant. Let's call it a description of the nightmare that even someone as techy as a blockchain engineer had to go through to control the fee of their transaction. I see all these posts on Twitter about ""improving the user experience""... and Ethereum ecosystem can't get submitting transactions right... are you kidding me?

**It feels like in Metamask, it's made to be difficult so that people get frustrated and use the highest fee possible.** Tell me I'm crazy and this isn't your experience. Tell me I'm wrong. I'm all for learning how to do everything right.

What happened?

I wanted to sign (and submit) a transaction on metamask with a hardware wallet (HW). It's a smart contract transaction (and a big one, so the execution fee is unusually high), so I wanted to minimize the fee. Metamask was suggesting something like 45 gwei, which is very expensive and I'm not in a hurry. In blockchain (whether it's bitcoin, monero or otherwise), we're supposed to have the freedom to submit our transactions with low fees, and when the network is less congested it will go through. Right... RIGHT?

So, I whip out my HW  (which is a hassle, and I don't want to do it many times), I sign the transaction with 8 gwei, and submit it. 

To my surprise, not only the transaction failed, but the nonce is not incrememnted (not a smart contract transaction failure, as I see on the block explorer), AND METAMASK HAS NO OPTION TO REBROADCAST THE TRANSACTION, even though it's NOT invalid!!!!

I thought, OK, maybe this is a glitch. I'll do it again. I redo the signing with my HW. And it failed again, and again, and again. At that point, I realized that this is just Metamask trying to make my life hell. There's no option to rebroadcast, and it WANTS TO FORCE ME TO USE A HIGH FEE, so EVERY TIME I WANT TO SUBMIT THE SAME FREAKING TRANSACTION, I HAVE TO SIGN IT AGAIN????? Wtf is that supposed to be?

And here's what's even worse: There's no way to extract the signed transaction as a hex string, so that I can submit it later elsewhere... how dare I want to pay less fees? I must be crazy!

So, I was done with this shit and now I'm just stubborn. I opened the developer tools in the browser, tracked the function that submits transactions in Metamask, and pulled the transaction hex from the belly of that fox. Done. Now I have the signed transaction hex. 

Here's where Metamask problems end, and Etherscan problems begin.

I go to pushTx on Etherscan to submit the transaction, submit it, track it on Etherscan, and sleep on it.

Today in the morning, I wake up, I try to check the transaction, it hasn't gone through (it's not in a block yet), EVEN THOUGH THE SUGGESTED FEE NOW IS LOWER THAN THE FEE I USED FOR THE TRANSACTION. Etherscan still says that my transaction didn't go through. So what's wrong? 

If I have to guess what happened, I think all stakers/miners dropped my transaction from their mempools. Fine, I understand (even though this is hostile to user experience since all this is within 12 hours). So, I try to submit my transaction again using the hex I collected yesterday, but Etherscan complains that the transaction is ""already known""... wtf is that???? I immediately recognize that this is ANOTHER BUG... Etherscan has the transaction in its cache, but it's not in the mempool!

I go to another website that offers transaction hex submission, I submitted, and my transaction went through in 1 minute. NIGHTMARE IS F**KING OVER!

Conclusion: WTF was that? Am I the only one in the world who controls their fees?

**Edit:** Serious conclusion: If you're not a tech nerd like me, there's no way to defer submitting a transaction with low fee to a later time. You can only just keep signing the same transaction again and again when the fee you want is viable, or increase the fee. Horrible for usability.

**Edit 2:** Imagine being so tribal that you downvote such a detailed post from a blockchain expert explaining a real problem in Ethereum ecosystem. And the Ethereum community wonders why people complain about usability. If you cared, this post would get 1 million upvotes.

Reddit,ethereum,Why nearly everyone misunderstands rollups. How it's possible to have both an optimistic bridge and zk bridge on a single rollup.,2024-11-21 23:40:26,"One of the most interesting panels at Devcon this month was **""[This is how rollups really work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k)"" by Kelvin Fichter** from Optimism, who says that most people in the crypto community have an incorrect understanding for what is a rollup.

This is actually a fairly deep concept, and there are even parts I still don't fully understand.

####**Most of us have an incorrect concept of what a rollup is**

Fichter brings up the idea that the concept of an ""optimistic rollup"" or ""zk rollup"" doesn't actually exist because ""classical rollups"" (i.e. smart contract rollups) are not purely defined by their smart contract bridges. Classical rollups can actually have multiple bridges, and they aren't necessarily fixed to one L1<>L2 bridge.

**The precise definition of a rollup he prefers is**:

> A blockchain that uses another blockchain for ordering and data availability.

In other words:

* Compressed data is completely stored on L1 (or in blobs)
* L1 ultimately provides ordering for the transactions in the rollup data
* For classical rollups, L1 also provides consensus for rollups through a trust-minimized bridge. For sovereign rollups, L2 nodes provide consensus.

And that's it. It does not necessarily need to have a bridge with optimistic proofs or zk proofs. And sovereign rollups do not even use the base layer for consensus.

This isn't the first time this idea has been brought up. Several other notable discussions:

* Jon Charbonneau - https://dba.mirror.xyz/LYUb_Y2huJhNUw_z8ltqui2d6KY8Fc3t_cnSE9rDL_o (an excellent summary)
* Kelvin Fichter - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlxSP_ABE4Y
* Toghrul Maharramov - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k

####**What would happen if a rollup had more than 1 bridge (optimistic + zk)?**

The vast majority of rollups we're familiar with (e.g. Optimism, Arbitrum One, Base, Linea) have exactly 1 enshrined bridge. We typically call them ""optimistic rollups"" or ""zk rollups"" as **a simplification of the definitions** because their main smart contract bridge back to L1 with the vast majority of TVL uses either optimistic proofs or zk proofs. If that single L1<>L2 bridge were compromised, the whole network would practically be compromised. So for simplicity, we assign the value of the rollup to that single bridge.

But technically, someone else could build a zk bridge on an ""optimistic rollup"" to store sequenced transaction data on L1. And if over time, 99% of the TVL transfers from the optimistic bridge over to the zk bridge, it would shift from being an optimistic rollup to a hybrid rollup and then to a zk rollup.

While I can't think of any rollup that currently has multiple types of bridges, the concept isn't new.

For example, the **Polygon PoS network** was originally a Plasma chain because it had a [Plasma bridge] (https://polygonscan.com/txnbridge) (that's still active). Later on, it shifted to a smart contract bridge, which ended up with nearly all the TVL activity. There are 2 main bridges on the same network, so Polygon PoS is more than just a Plasma chain or a Side chain. It's a network with 2 bridges of different types.

Overall, I think it's still fine to refer rollups as an ""optimistic rollup"" or a ""zk rollup"" as a simplification, but it's important to understand how rollups really works and why those terms are technically misleading.",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

I've got no beef with you and and I admire the grind. However, that's not my story.

I started stack sats in late 2019 early 2020 when BTC was around $18,000 and stuck out the highs and the lows. I recently sold a good chunk of my sats when Bitcoin was at $89k to furnish my apartment, pay my brother back the 8 grand I owed him and most importantly, buy my dream car.

I was able to do this all because of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has helped me afford a life I never thought I could.

Like I said, I've got no beef with people who will die before selling but that ain't me. My job doesn't give me enough financial stability to have these things while also hodling like a mad man. Of course I plan on DCAing for as long as possible but I wanted to enjoy the fruits of my diamond hands.

Reddit,bitcoin,There's a non-zero chance of generating a wallet that has already been generated,2024-12-03 11:48:04,"Yes, there is. Mathematically undeniable.

No, it won't happen. here's why:

**Intro:**

Every now and then we stumble upon a reddit post in r/Bitcoin in which someone asks for the chances of someone else randomly generating the same wallet as theirs, or any variation of this topic.  
I know mine it won't be a once and for all post that forever settles the debate, but allow me to try to give you my perspective and convince you that humans are bad at big numbers:

A few facts (as of today):

\-**24 word bip39 seed has a total of 2,9\*10\^79 unique addresses** (from now on referred to as the seed space)  
\-**Age of the universe** **is 1,37\*10\^10 years**  
\-**Bitcoin network total hash-rate is** **7,8\*10\^20 hash per second** or better 2,45\*10\^28 hash per year (from now on referred to as the bitcoin supercomputer)

**Experiment number 1**:

now, lets calculate how many lifetimes of the universe it would take for 1Million bitcoin supercomputers to go through 0,000000000000000001% (or 10\^-20) of the total seed space:

2,9\*10\^79 \* 10\^-20 / (1,37\*10\^10 \* 10\^6 \* 2,45\*10\^28) = 8,6 \*10\^14 universes lifetimes :)

so basically, if every person who ever lived (\~100Billion people) each produced 1 Billion wallets in their lifetime (meaning 1 wallet each 3 seconds for their 100 years lifetime) we would end up with 10\^20 unique wallets, and it would take \~ 800'000'000'000'000 (8\*10\^14) times the life of the universe, using 1M bitcoin supercomputers to have 1 on 290'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 (1 in 2,9\*10\^59) chances to get a collision. give it or take.

for comparison, if earth were the only planet in the universe to host life, the chance of life in our universe would be 1 in \~2\*10\^23. Now picture that life in the universe would still be \~500'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 times more likely than the scenario depicted above.

Hopefully this gave you perspective on how bad we are at grasping the magnitude of big numbers, but if it didn't, here's a game i like to play.

**Experiment number 2:**

Again, 24 words bip39 seed has a total of 2,9\*10\^79 unique addresses, while the observable universe has roughly between 10^(78) and 10^(82) atoms. Lets then say we consider the two numbers to be equal.

**Now, here's the game**:   
I pick a random atom in the whole observable universe and then ask you to do the same. you win big time (i give you 1Billion $) if you can pick the same exact atom, if you can't you give me 100$. This might already give you an idea of the magnitude, but if you're not convinced and want to play nonetheless, I'll even allow you to continue picking atoms until you make it, does that seem fair to you?  
So your chance now depends on how many attempts you can make per second and how likely you want to be to be correct. Lets say that you want to have 50% chance of picking my atom, then you'd need to go through 50% of the possibilities, that are (2.96/2)\*10^(79,) roughly 1,48\*10^(79.) Not very different i am afraid.  
  
One of the best supercomputers out there is the bitcoin network, so now I even allow you to rely on that to make our atom picking faster, it can perform 7,8\*10^(20) operations per second, therefore--> 1.48\*10^(79) / 7,8\*10^(20) = 1,89\*10^(58) seconds would be required for you to pick half of the universe's atoms, roughly 6\*10^(50) years, 6\*10^(41) billion years or 4,6\*10^(40) times the age of the universe.  
All this time, with the most powerful computer network known to mankind, just to have a 50% chance. Now, imagine you had 1000 billions earth-like planets at your disposal, each with a bitcoin network super computer, and 1000 billions universes each with 1000 billions earth-like planet each with its own bitcoin computer, each searching for the same wallet (I mean atom! sorry), it would still take 6\*10^(27) billion years to, again, have a toss of a coin chances to get it right, so I want to be even more fair to you, and instead of 1 atom, i pick the equivalent of 100Billion people, each picking 1Billion atoms, therefore 10\^20 wallets (atoms!), and you win if you can pick any of those.. it would still require 6\*10\^7 Billion years!

  
**Would you still play with me?**

(btw, there are only \~55Million addresses with balance in existence as of today)

**tl;dr: the chance is virtually 0 in any universe, however you look at it, whatever you have at your disposal to perform the task.**",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,bitcoin,Supply and Demand Discussion ,2024-12-04 00:50:32,"Hey all, 

So with 100K coming around the corner and a likely rally into the new year, I was wondering if we could have a discussion about supply and demand.   
  
It seems that Bitcoin's price increase is largely determined by adoption and people investing to keep the volume high enough to reach a break out. With governments coming into the Bitcoin sphere, it seems that the volatility of Bitcoin could come down to governments selling off a significant portion of their Bitcoin all at once. If they hold the mentality that Bitcoin is a store of value, it seems that the support levels for Bitcoin may continue higher. I guess what I am trying to understand is, how is Bitcoin's price effected by other variables outside of increased volume? with prices getting higher, Bitcoin sentiment may reflect a price that is too expensive to enter, and with Bitcoin likely moving into diminishing returns over the years, how could expense be a factor that reduce ones willingness to enter the market? With DCA strategies it is likely that the market will continue to go higher over the long term, however larger moves seem to be in the hands of larger bodies who are investing a significant amount into the market at once. Sometimes I find it hard to see beyond the view of fresh buyers are ultimately pushing the returns of earlier ones.   
  
I understand this is a trading mentality which misses the point of Bitcoin's ethos, however what is to say that the recent adoption is pushing Bitcoin away from something that is effected by government hands when they're leveraging such huge positions which could be sold at any point?

The miners and more importantly, THE NODES, keep the blockchain decentralized, not the entities that hold bitcoin.

The fact that one individual, company or government can buy as as many coins as they can, following the laws of supply and demand of free markets, has NOTHING to do with Bitcoin´s ""centralization"".

Bitcoin decentralization precisely allows for ANYONE to participate no matter how rich or poor you are, or if you are a private or public individual, a company, a country or a virtual digital entity or any kind of agentic or autonomous AI.

\- Interest on customer deposits

Reddit,bitcoin,Resetting network difficulty after extreme event,2024-12-03 14:14:21,"It is often said that in the case of extreme events (World War, collapse of the internet, etc.), the Bitcoin network should remain active as long as there is one active node (and one miner?). We know mining difficulty changes every 2,016 blocks by a factor (4 being the maximum factor). If the network hashrate fell by, let’s say, 99% due to an extreme event, we would have to wait until the next difficulty adjustment to get a lower difficulty, and even then it would be only 4 times lower, not 99% lower. Even ignoring the maximum adjustment factor, we would have to wait a long time until the first difficulty adjustment. If the extreme event happened right after the difficulty adjustment, we would have to wait 2\*100 weeks for the next adjustment, and the miner(s) would need approximately 7 days for each block confirmation. This seems unsustainable, so I am asking: is there a way to reset the difficulty in a case like this? Would there be a need for a hard fork?",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,bitcoin,Anyone else taking a more cautious approach with Bitcoin?,2024-12-03 22:12:08,"Is the Bitcoin community mostly split between people who are all in and those who are all out? I’m taking a more conservative route, with about fifteen percent of my portfolio in Bitcoin. I guess I’m coming from the mindset of traditional, balanced investing—diversifying, staying cautious, and thinking long-term—but still seeing the potential in Bitcoin.

I think it’s a good store of value, especially as a hedge against inflation. But with the price near one hundred thousand, it feels like a lot of the current value is driven by speculation. Sure, there’s adoption with things like the Lightning Network and El Salvador using it as legal tender, but it’s nowhere near the scale I expected by now. It still feels like Bitcoin isn’t quite living up to its potential in terms of real-world use.

Also, how long until governments get on board? I imagine it could take decades, especially with current leaders who don’t seem to trust it. So, for now, I’m comfortable with my modest position, while keeping an eye on where it all goes.

One thing I keep wondering is whether the logic we use for traditional investments, like balancing risk and growth, should still apply to Bitcoin. It’s clearly a new kind of asset, but doesn’t some of that cautious investing logic still make sense, even in this new space?

Anyone else out there taking a similar cautious but optimistic approach? Or am I overthinking it? Curious to hear how others are seeing Bitcoin’s role in a portfolio.",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,bitcoin,Discussion: Lost coins,2024-12-03 17:19:06,"I’ve rarely heard any Bitcoin talking head address this issue and I’m curious how the community feels about this. 

There will only ever be 21mm coins. (Per my casual googling) Satoshi has ~1mm, and there have been ~3mm coins considered “lost” forever. For the sake of argument , let’s say another .25mm are “lost” forever as adoption continues to grow. That leaves us with approximately 15.75mm coins truly available to the world, only 75% of the original intended supply (78% if you don’t count Satoshi’s coins). IMO, it’s hard to sell the idea of Bitcoin to a “normie” if there is an element of “oh by the way, it’s entirely possible to lose your coins forever by accident” 

How does Bitcoin reconcile this? How do we account for or anticipate people losing their coins in the coming decades? How would this impact adoption and scaling for the decades to come? Is this even a problem we should start thinking about? ",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

This includes unused real estate, luxury goods, and digital assets (they used BTC as an example - many times)

This proposal came up during discussions on the 2025 Finance Bill and again they used Bitcoin as an example to illustrate the tax's potential range. The purpose of the tax is to capture wealth from assets that dont contribute to economic productivity

A preliminary vote (EMPHASIS ON PRELIMINARY) on this amendment was held on November 26 where only supporting senators were in the chamber - the vote passed in this setting but it doesnt represent the final say yet. The amendment still needs to survive more legislative scrutiny before actually becoming law

If this proposal moves forward then EU is risking isolating itself as a continent unable to keep up with innovation - maybe even driving talent and capital elsewhere

Here is the amendment (its in French obviously): [https://www.senat.fr/amendements/2024-2025/143/Amdt\_I-128.html](https://www.senat.fr/amendements/2024-2025/143/Amdt_I-128.html)

Congratulations to anybody in South Korea who had some limit orders in at low prices, sadly it seems to come with a military takeover of the government.

So maybe the smart move is to set up some low limit orders on your current exchange in preparation for the coming declaration of martial law near you.

Once ADA sky rocketed I thought, well I've been holding  a whole year, why not hodl a bit more? But then I say: I don't want to loose a 2x because of greediness.   
  
Something tells me ADA won't make it to it's ATH right now, maybe on 2025, but I feel like another bear market is coming before March 2025. I read it somewhere and it stuck into my mind: big players are going to make noise and propagate fear around the crypto market to trigger a bear market, so they can jump in and then use Trump period to pump their bags.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Remember. You can always sell a portion of your holdings. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Make a plan.,2024-12-03 15:52:37,"I constantly read people say, “Oh just my luck, I sold all my XRP to go into purple unicorn (or whatever it is) just 6 months ago! I can’t believe I missed out on this. Just my luck!”

Remember. You can always sell a portion of a holding when you hit a price target. You don’t have to liquidate the asset entirely. The key though is to have a plan, otherwise you’ll be second guessing yourself constantly with the daily/weekly pumps and dumps.

My plan? I sell a third of all my assets when the total market cap hits 4 trillion. I sell another third when the total market cap hits 7 trillion. Right now I’m not buying anything unless the total market cap dips below 2 trillion. 

I’m not saying this is a great plan, just what I’m doing. Make sure you have a plan or else you’ll be doing the flip flap trader stuff that will screw you over in the long term.

What I’m realizing more and more with each cycle is that no one really knows what’ll happen with different assets. It’s incredibly hard to pick winners. About a year ago I posted my portfolio and was clowned on. My general strategy? The majority of my holdings are in BTC and ETH. I then have a basket of the big L1s that can handle volume.  I own a total of 26 coins. Alts make up a much smaller % than BTC and ETH. 

For years people have said SOL & ADA are shit, XRP sucks, ALGO is mid, DOGE’s inflation is ridiculous, XLM and LTC are washed. Tbh, I think pretty much all cryptos are stupid including these. But I still bought them because ultimately I don’t know what will play out long term. But I figure that the gains from 1-3 coins will pay for the losses of the rest and it’s worked out so far.

Unless you’re only in BTC, I really hate the “concentration is the way to go bro, otherwise you’ll dilute your gains” perspective. Because how do you know you’re right? Look at EOS or NEO. How do you know that you picked the right winners? Now should be said, how do I know that I picked the 26 correct winners? I don’t. But generally speaking, I’ll model my portfolio after what Grayscale does so that at the least I’m riding the currents of the institutional players.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,We need to have a serious talk about Marketcaps. ,2024-12-02 23:53:49,"On the XRP sub and other places filled with XRP Maxis, people are saying XRP is going to hit $100 as if it's a very real and very feasible target for the community. Let's talk about what exactly that would look like. XRP has a circulating supply of 57B. At a price of $100 each that would put the marketcap of XRP at $5.7T. OVER 3X the current marketcap of BTC, and this doesn't even consider the inevitable increase in circulating supply as time passes.

Look I get it, it's fun to dream about 25x (or 250x gains for people talking about XRP to $1,000 - I'm dead serious people are talking about this) but don't let those dreams cause you to make bad investment decisions.

\---------

**You want to know what other community was talking about having a $5.9T marketcap in 2021?** In 2021 Shiba Inu to $.01 was all the rage as people swore that it was a realistic and feasible target for the meme token and many made terrible investment decisions as a result swearing that Shiba Inu was going to hit $.01. Looking at Shiba Inu now it's.... not even close to it's 2021 ATH, and lets be clear will never hit $.01.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"NanoGPT (use AI through crypto) update: system prompts, SillyTavern, Binance Pay/Coinbase Wallet, UX, more models, payment stats",2024-12-03 07:03:22,"Lots of changes since our most recent update!

[NanoGPT update](https://preview.redd.it/7c60t84v0l4e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f20c8a3bd22f552a43b7980f94b4c046d3d36804)

# UX improvements:

\- It's now possible to add a **system prompt** (for all models except Claude/Gemini ones)

\- There's a **dark/light mode switch** next to new chat

\- **Export chats** as PDF or Markdown by appending ?export=pdf or =md to the URL

\- ALT + C for new chat, ALT + I for new image (Option C and Option I on Mac)

# New models:

\- **Qwen QwQ 32b** is Alibaba's answer to OpenAI's o1-preview. It ""thinks"", and only starts outputting later.

\- OpenAI and Google released about 4 **new versions of ChatGPT/Gemini**, to constantly overtake each other on the leaderboards (we immediately push their newest version live every time). Google also released LearnLM, a model focused specifically on helping people learn new skills, which of course we added.

\- Alibaba's **Qwen Max, Qwen Large, Qwen Long and Qwen Turbo** have been added, very low prices and up to 10m token context. Almost no other provider offers these models.

\- **Step-2-16k**, another Chinese model, is also pretty much only available through us. It scores extremely well on the LiveBench comparison, and is very popular in China.

\- **Mistral Large** and a *ton* of open-source models got added. These include many Roleplay/Storytelling models (more on that below) and **two ""abliterated"" models**, versions of models that have been finetuned to remove limitations and biases. They're uncensored versions, essentially.

# Cool integrations:

\- **SillyTavern** is an open-source front-end that many people use for roleplaying. We're now natively supported and suddenly have a lot more users that are interested in roleplaying models, hence also the additions.

\- **""battleofcoins.com""** lets you pick crypto, pick models, and have the AIs discuss and debate which one is best over multiple rounds. Very fun implementation, you can pick any selection criteria you want.

# More:

\- We added lots of additional payment methods: **Binance Pay, Coinbase Wallet**, ETH + L2s, and a lot more. This is likely the last additions we did for a while there, since anything else feels like diminishing returns.

\- We released **payment stats** on how much the different crypto were used. I'll add this into a comment because I'm afraid links will get the post removed. 



Also important for many of you: we have a working branch with file uploads. It can take excel files, pdfs, documents etc. We want to release it as soon as possible but it's also a change that needs quite a bit of testing, so we don't want to push it too soon and get people annoyed at how badly it works.

Hear me out: what if regulatory approvals for assets like XRP which recently skyrocketed, alongside their stablecoin initiatives, are the way for big companies to embrace crypto payments while moving the risks associated with volatile crypto assets towards the users?

Plus, let’s not forget their moves toward launching their own ETF. This could position them to create a store of value backed by substantial market support, potentially enabling them to stabilize against market fluctuations.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What are the appeal for joining an exclusive community in crypto.,2024-12-04 00:49:28,"I don't know if it's a me thing, and if it's just because of my own personal experience, but I'm always drawn to exclusive stuffs, especially in crypto.   
  
Of course everyone knows how important community is in web3, but what I'm talking about are the exclusive ones, good examples of what I mean is the Trading group I joined, or the BGB holders community, that I joined earlier this year, a group for people holding Bitget's native token, BGB.   
  
Funny thing is for the second one I didn't even need to pay a fee, I found that if you hold at least 100 BGB you'd get access to the Telegram, and although BGB price is currently at $1.5 when I first got in, it was at $0.6, so I didn't even have any issue getting it.   
  
I believe stuffs like these sell themselves, it's no secret how communities centered around crypto can offer so much, I've been able to connect with other traders, win exclusive merch, and get access to unique opportunities like staking and discounts. Considering the criteria for getting in, I think it's one of my best decisions this year. At least that's what I tell myself LOL.   
  
That said, are there similar groups? I'd like to know other people experience with things like this, what's the most surprising reason you joined a group, and how did it go?",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,So I had some XYO (how FOMO begins)…,2024-12-04 00:26:33,"XYO was one of my kinda low effort low amount buys a while ago.  It had been slowly dripping downward, so I put it into cardano and started turning green…. until the next day!     

XYO shoots 100% up.   I was shocked, but it was like 200$ that could have turned 400$… so we aren’t talking life changing, But pulling out 200 in profit would be nice.   soo, i laugh it off, but snoop around for other coins and end up spending 300$ on a few coins.   I go to bed.  


Middle of the night, I wake up and XYO dipped like 5%…. I thought, funny if i put 100$, but instead spent another 200$ on other coins.   

That’s not the way I make crypto purchases, that’s the way i shop on amazon drunk at 3am.   


I wake up that morning.   …  XYO 200%!  awfackin come on!!  

I’m on tilt now… trying to figure out what coin is like a degree away from XYO that will do the same thing in a week.   I’m deep in the weeds, dropping 50$ buys on coins that are at their current run peak, barely avoiding ath’s.     

Finally, the fever breaks as chainlink shot up and rebalanced my portfolio and temperament a little.   

Now is not the time to buy anything really unless you believe strongly in the tech, and even then, you could quickly become caught holding a small cold bag thru a long winter.   I’m not sure what’s to come, but weird stuff is happening and it almost had me trading like it’s a poker game.  

tl:dr… if XYO was my entire portfolio and i realized those gains… well, I could buy a nice used, no …. pre-owned certified uh, import.   ",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Let’s talk limit buy orders and exchanges/options,2024-12-03 23:58:43,"Lately I’ve been setting some low-ball limit buys hoping to catch a dip. The problem I have is that I have to have the money in my exchange account (in this case Coinbase) instead of being able to just connect it to my checking account. 

I see where it makes sense for the exchange. They need the funds to execute the buy and can’t rely on you to have the money in your personal account or credit card or whatever. Plus they have your money like a bank does and they’re earning off of it while it sits idle. 

But because of this, I can’t set all of the orders I’d like to bc I won’t put that amount of money in the exchange just hoping that some day those orders fill. Plus, its not like the exchange is paying me interest while they hold my funds like my bank will. My personal account would be able to execute all of the orders even if they hit at once so it just makes sense to me to not give up control of my money while I’m waiting for a dip that gets to my number. 

Is there another option I don’t know of? Is there an exchange that doesn’t require a deposit to issue a limit order? Is there just some other nuance I don’t know about, or is the only option to back all orders with matching deposits on the exchanges?",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Polygon Ecosystem: Explore the Future of the Web,2024-12-03 07:08:42,"Today surfing again through the Internet I crossed with [https://polygon.technology/](https://polygon.technology/) site and well I decided to dive in a little and check what it could offer to me so I started to click here and there.

[Home Screen](https://preview.redd.it/7hqigik72l4e1.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfa401600b5b02f8e7472d19dc82395b05a1e66)

For what I could see this site has a lot of useful information to teach everyone how to build, stake and in general use Polygon ecosystem. However one of the sections that brought my attention more is Polygon Ecosystem section [https://polygon.technology/ecosystem](https://polygon.technology/ecosystem)

[Polygon Ecosystem Screen](https://preview.redd.it/8j4eh9h82l4e1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e412b01866caacd0216011ee7340086c918999)

I believe this kind of sections are really important to bring attention to different projects in the ecosystem and also make it easy to find them and also the legit links to them.

As you can see in the images, the UI is quite beautiful.

In the following image we can see the hot apps in the ecosystem like Quickswap, 1inch, Planet lx (First time I hear about it), Uniswap V3, Galxe, etc.

[Hot dApps](https://preview.redd.it/w02f5as92l4e1.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12725c0872c1f291ba5a11a3457c0ee10a60c88)

If we go down a bit more we can see a search bar with different options making it easier to navigate and find the different apps registered to appear there.

[dApps searcher](https://preview.redd.it/kc7nwp3b2l4e1.png?width=1453&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa673c9823048be4d1a82e68d3fd606754d0ba97)

Regarding the registering process, it looks that ""anyone"" can do it through an easy button on the top and I believe it is free if you meet the criteria.

To conclude, I believe this kind of ecosystem searchers should be available in all existing L1 sites.

I mostly understand bitcoins use cases but I realize I don’t actually understand the technology behind it very well. Also even though I’ve owned etherium since 2018 I realize I don’t even know what a smart contract is or what its use cases are. Now we have Solana and avalanche which I believe are similar cryptos but since I don’t understand them or their actual use cases I don’t know how to pick which one I want to own.

The analysis concludes that public permissionless blockchains represent a promising alternative to permissioned platforms, with the potential to reduce dependencies and mitigate monopolistic market structures on a platform level. It emphasizes that compliance does not necessarily require a platform-wide gatekeeper or other forms of base layer regulation, but can instead be implemented higher up on the technology stack. This allows for more flexible approaches, based on asset- and application-types.

The video's got weak sources and a narrative that's super repetitive—exactly what we see in typical mass media. It's funny how ""tech influencers"" like Marques Brownlee end up backing this kind of content. It just shows how killer video editing and smooth storytelling can blow up on YouTube, even when the research is trash.

***Proof-of-Work***

The first approach is proof-of-work, famously used by Nakamoto for Bitcoin and inherited by many other blockchains. In this approach, at a very high level, users race to solve a very complex cryptographic puzzle. The first one to solve the puzzle has the right to append the next block to the chain. Proof-of-Work suffers from several flaws.

*First Flaw: Proof-of-Work Does Not Scale.* Proof-of-work is very slow. Bitcoin’s crypto puzzles are so hard in order to guarantee that one solution is found only every 10 minutes, no matter how many miners try to solve the crypto puzzle. We can understand expensive and fast. But expensive and slow is hard to understand. The world is a large place and one block of transactions every 10 minutes is hardly enough.

*Second Flaw: Proof-of-Work Results in De-Facto Centralization.* Proof-of-work has caused a tremendous concentration of power. This centralization is a consequence of the fact that Proof-of-Work is both expensive and wasteful. The amount of computation performed by the *miners* — that is, the users trying to solve the crypto puzzles —is stunning. Mining today utilizes racks and racks of specialized hardware and consumes an enormous amount of electricity. One miner wins the race and generates the new block, and the efforts of all the others are wasted. Without the subsidies that Bitcoin currently offers, the cost of posting a single transaction on Bitcoin’s blockchain is around $20. Not the way to go if you want to use the blockchain for everyday transactions like buying a slice of pizza or if you want to use it offer financial services to those 2.2 billion who are currently not served by the financial system.

The common user would lose money if she tried to solve the crypto puzzle with her laptop. Win or lose, she must pay for the electricity necessary to power the computations of her laptop. This amount of electricity may not be big, but her probability of winning is so small that, in expectation, she would lose money.

Only professional miners, who have made the capital expenditure necessary to buy racks and racks of hyper specialized mining equipment, can expect to make a small profit. Accordingly, only they participate in block generation. Furthermore, miners consociate in *mining pools*.

Today, Bitcoin’s blockchain is controlled by just three mining pools and Ethereum’s by just two mining pools. If they so decide, or if they are bribed to do so, these mining pools can rewrite the database: they can erase blocks or change the order of blocks. Proof-of-work has turned what was intended to be a decentralized system into an extremely centralized one.

*Third Flaw: Proof-of-Work Is Not Secure.* As we said, any blockchain that is centralized, whether by design or *de facto*, is insecure. But proof-of-work has additional vulnerabilities, and it is especially vulnerable to network attacks. A blockchain ultimately is a communication protocol, and any such protocol is executed over an underlying communication network. An adversary may thus attack either the protocol — e.g., by sending messages that are different from the prescribed ones — or the communication network itself — e.g., by interfering with routers, cables, etc.

Just how insecure proof-of-work is may be underestimated because the current way of analyzing a blockchain’s security is flawed. This analysis typically focuses only on protocol attacks and neglects network attacks that, especially in the context of proof-of-work, can be deadly. For instance, in a proof-of-work blockchain, an adversary capable of partitioning the communication network for an hour or two could double-spend with impunity. In a successful partitioning attack, an adversary prevents the messages sent by the users belonging to a set of users A from reaching the users in a separate set B, and vice versa. Network partitioning has not attracted much attention, because it is considered too expensive to be practical. But the cost of a network attack may be justified, once the gains are high enough. A truly borderless economy may be valued in trillions of dollars. And an adversary may be willing to ‘invest’ millions of dollars, if he stands to illicitly gain billions of dollars.

*Fourth Flaw: Forks.* Another disadvantage of proof-of-work is the unavoidable existence of *forks*. Whenever two or more users solve the crypto puzzles within a few seconds of each other, the chain branches because users may now see multiple candidates for the next block. A fork may continue to exist for a while, and all its branches may even be elongated by the addition of new blocks. But eventually, all branches but one will die, and all the blocks in the dead branches will disappear.

Forks are an unwelcome source of uncertainty and delay. If a payment made to you appears in the latest block added to the chain, you cannot consider yourself paid and ship the goods. This is so because some branch may overcome the current chain and your block may end up in a dead branch and vanish. Before considering yourself paid, you would need to wait for a sequence of blocks to be added to yours, so as to minimize the chance that a soft fork will arise and the block containing your payment will end up on a dead branch.

How long should you wait for? Some people recommend six blocks to be added after yours to be confident that your block will remain on the chain. Others recommend an even longer wait, if the payment made to you is sizable. Thus, rather than waiting ten minutes, to have reasonable confidence in the finality of a transaction, in reality you have to wait hours.

Some people have suggested making the crypto puzzles easier in order to speed up the process, for instance by making it possible to find a solution every minute, rather than every 10 minutes. However, by doing so, the probability of getting two solutions within a few seconds of each other increases significantly. The system can cope with an occasional soft fork, but not with very frequent forks.

Expenses, slowness, and uncertainty are indeed major flaws in the proof-of-work approach, but they pale in comparison with its fatal flaw.

*The Fatal Flaw in Proof-of-Work.* Recall the already discussed fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.*

In proof-of-work, this small part of the economy is that owned by the miners. Since the miners own only a small fraction of the money in a proof-of-work blockchain, the chain is not secure.

***Delegated Proof-of-Stake***

A different approach is delegated proof-of-stake (PoS). This is a very simple idea. The community empowers a few special users, the *delegates*, to choose the next block, at least for a while. (For example, in EOS, the number of the delegates is 21.)

Delegated PoS is, therefore, centralized from the get-go. Hopefully, the chosen delegates are honest to begin with. However, relying on delegates remaining honest for a long time is risky.

Once again, we have that *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a delegated-PoS blockchain the delegates may own a tiny fraction of the total money in the system, yet the whole blockchain is secure if and only if the majority of delegates are honest.

*Additional Security Problems.* Even assuming that there is an ironclad guarantee that all the delegates will remain honest forever, they can easily be attacked. In particular, they can be brought down by a denial of service (DoS) attack. In such an attack, an adversary bombards any user of his choice with zillions of junk messages, causing the buffer of that unfortunate user to overflow. If a delegate were so bombarded, he would be unable to perform his job, namely collating new and valid transactions into the next block. The blockchain would grind to a halt.

DoS attacks are quite cheap and can be mounted instantly against not only 21 people but even 1000 people. Since delegates are known, even if they were kept in power for just a day or an hour or a minute, a determined adversary could bring down all the delegates by a fast DoS attack.

***Bonded Proof-of-Stake***

Bonded PoS allows 20 users, 200 users, as many as are willing, to put some money on the table — a bond — where they can no longer touch it. These are the users who select the next block on behalf of all of us. If they misbehave, their money is confiscated.

Does this approach work?

Let me ask a simpler question: how much of your disposable income can you afford to put hostage on the table? The answer is a very small amount. Bonded PoS therefore, not only makes it possible, but actually makes it *easy* for big thieves with deep pockets to put a disproportionate amount of money on the table for the sole purpose of controlling the blockchain.

But so what? If they misbehave, they lose their hostage money. However, a truly decentralized, scalable and secure blockchain should secure trillions of dollars in assets. And by misbehaving, a malicious user stands to make a few billion dollars. This being the case, do you think that he may fear having a few million dollars confiscated? This is just the price of doing business. And it is a small price at that.

Once more, in bonded PoS, we have the same fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a bonded PoS this small part of the economy consists of (the owners of) “the money laying hostage on the table.”

In sum, prior approaches suffer from several drawbacks. We need a better design.

**Algorand’s Logic and Pure Proof-of-Stake.** Algorand’s logic is simple: it ties the security of the whole economy to the honesty of the *majority* of the economy, and makes it impossible for a small subset of the economy to control the fate of the whole economy.

Algorand is based on a new Proof-of-Stake: *Pure* *PoS*. Essentially, a Pure PoS does not try to keep users honest by the fear of imposing fines. Rather, it makes cheating by a minority of the money impossible and cheating by a majority of the money stupid.

In Algorand no money is ever hostage. All money is always where it should be: in your wallet, at your fingertips ready to be spent, or in the various financial instruments that the Algorand blockchain offers you. When you take in consideration all the money in the system, wherever it may be, the system is secure when most of the money is in honest hands.

As we said, it is impossible for the owners of a small fraction of the money to harm the whole system, and it would be silly for the owners of the majority of the money to misbehave so as to devalue their own holdings.

For example, in proof-of-work or bonded PoS, a few users can prevent other users from transacting. In Algorand, only the owners of the majority of the money could prevent other users from transacting. But if they did so, the reputation of the currency would be greatly harmed, the currency would no longer universally accepted, and its purchasing power would be greatly diminished. Not a good outcome for the owners of the majority of the money.

**Implementing Pure PoS.** Let us now see how Algorand uses pure PoS for choosing the next block. Remember the trilemma? We want block generation to be simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

At a very high level, in Algorand, a new block is constructed in two phases.

* In the first phase, a single token is randomly selected, and its owner is the user who proposes the next block.
* In the second phase, 1000 tokens are selected among all tokens currently in the system. The owners of these 1000 tokens are selected to be part of a phase-2 ‘committee,’ which approves the block proposed by the first user.

Accordingly, some member of the committee may be chosen twice or more generally some k times, in which case, that member will have k votes in the committee to approve the next block.

Why is the second phase necessary?

In any society, and blockchains are no exception, there is always a small percentage of bad actors to be found; let us say 1 percent. Maybe 2 percent. If one is unfortunate enough to live in a very dangerous society, 10 percent may be bad actors. Perhaps even 20 percent! But in no society will bad actors be in a majority; otherwise, there would not be a society. A society exists insofar as the majority of its members follow prescribed rules.

Assume that 10 percent of the tokens in Algorand belong to dishonest people. Then, one in ten times, the user selected in phase 1 to propose a block may be a bad actor. Accordingly, he may tell some users that the block is X and other users that the block is Y and so on and so forth, thereby creating disagreement about what the blockchain is.

Phase 2 eliminates this problem. Indeed, if you select at random 1000 tokens when at most 10 percent of the tokens are in dishonest hands, the probability that the majority of the selected coins belong to bad actors, that is, the probability that the majority of the committee’s votes are cast by bad actors is so low as to be negligible.

Assume that, this time around, you have not been selected to propose a block. Nor have you been selected to be part of a committee to approve a proposed block. But you see that a given block B has been approved by, say, 700 votes of the committee. Then, you know that B is indeed the next block.

**A Key Question.** At this high-level description, several questions naturally arise. Let us start with the most obvious one: *Who randomly chooses the committee?*

Suppose I tell you that I do. Then you might say “That is the most centralized system ever, and you are at the center of it!” Suppose I tell you that all users discuss until they agree on a thousand committee members who then agree on the block. Then you might tell me that, humanity being what it is, an entire lifetime is not going to be enough to select the thousand committee members that we require.

Algorand takes an unorthodox approach: *the committee members select themselves.* You may think “What? That is a terrible idea! Because if I am a bad actor, I am going to select myself to be a member of this committee. And the next. And the one after that…” But not so fast.

To belong to the committee, one of your coins must win an individual, cryptographically fair lottery that you run in isolation — that is, without talking to anyone else — in the privacy of your own computer. And since the lottery is cryptographically fair, you cannot alter the chances of being selected in the slightest. (Not even a nation state with huge computational resources would be able to increase the probability of being selected.)

To select 1,000 random tokens among, say, 10,000,000,000 tokens, each token is selected with probability 1,000/10,000,000,000 — i.e., with probability 1 in 10 million.

So, as soon as a user sees a block being proposed, she asks herself: can I be a member of the committee selected to approve a block? And how many votes will I have?

To answer these questions, she runs the cryptographic lottery on her laptop for each one of the tokens that she owns. (If a user has n tokens, additional technology essentially allows her to run a single lottery instead of n separate lotteries!)

Once a user runs her lottery, one of two cases occurs. Either none of her tokens wins the lottery, in which case whatever opinion she expresses about the block will be ignored. Or some k>1of her tokens win the lottery, in which case, she obtains a winning ticket, namely a short proof that everybody can easily verify that she has k votes in the committee. In this latter case, she propagates through the network (i) a winning ticket proving that she has k votes and (ii) her opinion about the block.

**Solving the Trilemma**. Let me argue that this sketched approach is — finally! — simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

*Scalability.*

How long does it take for a user to run her own lottery? Roughly a microsecond, no matter how many tokens she has. That is indeed superfast. (Additionally, all the lotteries are run independently of each other, so that no user has to wait for other users to finish running their lotteries.)

Once selected, each member propagates to the network a single, short and immediately computed message. So no matter how many users are in the system, the maximum number of messages that need to be propagated is 1000 short messages. Is this scalable? Yes!

*Security.*

Now we come to security. Assume that I am a very powerful adversary, capable of corrupting users extremely quickly whenever I want. Clearly, I would love to corrupt the members of the committee, but I have a problem: I do not know who they are.

This is so because committee members are selected by a secretly run, cryptographically fair, individual lottery. Thus, only they know who they are, up to the moment in which they propagate through the network both their winning tickets and their opinions about the block. Only at that time I might learn who the committee members are and, given my super powers, I can immediately corrupt the entire committee. But so what? Corrupting them at this time is too late. Whatever the committee members had to say, they have already said, and their winning tickets and up-or-down opinions about the block are virally propagating throughout the network. I have no more power to put their messages back in the bottle than a government has the power to put back in the bottle messages virally propagated by WikiLeaks.

In other words, the Algorand approach is secure because beforehand, an adversary does not know whom to corrupt, and by the time he does, corruption is useless.

Contrast this with having a fixed 1000-strong committee. As discussed before, even if the committee stayed in power for a minute, it would be vulnerable to a DoS attack. If the committee stayed in power for much longer, say a week, then the members could even be corrupted in the physical world via traditional means such as bribes. In Algorand’s case however, one would not know against whom to mount a DoS attack and once the committee has spoken, the DoS attack is useless.

*Decentralization.*

Finally, we come to decentralization. Are there a few users in charge of choosing the next block? No, there are not. Nor is there a fixed, 1000-strong, committee in charge of approving the block. This time, a committee has been randomly (and secretly) selected. Next time, a different committee will be randomly (and secretly) selected. Everybody has the chance of participating in the generation of a new block.

*Algorand’s Non-Forkable Chain.*

An additional advantage of Algorand’s technology is that its chain never forks. This is so because only one block can have the required threshold of committee votes. Accordingly, in Algorand all transactions are final. Once a block appears, you can count on it to be forever part of the chain. And if the new block contains a payment made to you, you may consider yourself paid and send the goods immediately.

The financial world has already its own risks and there is no need to burden it with the additional uncertainty of \`block disappearance.’ By the way, when I said that Algorand’s chain never forks, I somewhat lied. Indeed, forks may occur in Algorand but they are very rare. The probability of forking in Algorand is, by design, 10⁻¹⁸. This probability may appear a strange choice, but it actually has a natural explanation. Physicists tell us that 10¹⁸ happens to be the number of seconds from the Big Bang until now. In other words, if you produce a block a second, a very good clip by the way, you may see a soft fork, but you would have to wait for the lifetime of the universe to see it.",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"PSA: Withdrawals from large exchanges, Bybit warning.",2024-12-02 09:17:48,"I recently decided to give futures trading on Bybit a shot since I was impressed by their trading volumes (albeit bots probably).

Turns out that was a huge mistake, when you want to withdrawal your funds from a profitable account they suspend all withdrawals completely from your account. I understand this is a security measure which would normally require a KYC check.

Well, my account is already KYC, and today I have had to KYC 3 different occasions, stating different sentences on a piece of paper and show my passport multiple times. Finally after about 11 hours of chat and discussions with their support team, my account was unlocked.

I then attempted to complete my withdrawal, this time I was hit with a 2FA on a mobile phone number that I removed on my account less than 30 days ago. To remove this, I need to again go through rounds of KYC and to this time my withdrawal still has not been processed.

So - a word of warning to traders out there, stay aware from Bybit, after some research it seems a common practice for this exchange to make it as difficult as possible to withdraw. This scenario may also happen on other exchanges, particularly if your making money during the bull market. When users are making bank, particularly on leveraged accounts exchanges begin to feel the heat on their books. Could be a warning sign for Bybit, maybe not. I dont know but its awfully inconvenient.

BTW they also did not provide any complaint solutions, so instead I raised a complaint with their domestic authorities (which will likely go nowhere).

Thought I would share this experience - if your making money, be sure to withdraw from exchanges frequently into your own custody.

GL and GODSPEED

\*edit - update here, ive now be told it will take 7 days for Bybit to remove the mobile number they applied to my account before it can be removed and my funds withdrawn. To me this is a red flag, something is going on with Bybit.",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Altcoin Season Website,2024-12-02 03:45:46,"Hello all,

I have been in the tech and crypto scene for a bit and found that it is difficult to track the key indicators all in one place. 

So, for fun I’ve created the following site that gauges if we are in an alt season or not using the typical indicators.

It utilizes the CoinGecko API and TradingView charts.

I wanted to share it with you all to see if you had any feedback or caught anything I had missed.

The first issue you will notice is the values on the card do not match the charts. This is because CoinGecko returns the values and TradingView does the charts. The only fix is to create my own charts but that means I need to purchase CoinGeckos Pro API which costs a lot of money lol. However, the values are off by only a few percent and should still be dependable.

Please feel free to give me feedback on the site!

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

If I sign (Schnorr Signature) with x, does it only prove possession of the private key corresponding to P or does it also prove possession of the 2 individual public keys x1 & x2? Or if not proof of possession of both x1 & x2, does it atleast prove something more than just x?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

I am working on a lattice system based on the ISIS problem. ChatGPT keeps thinking this is a terrorist form of cryptography, but it's just inhomogeneous short integer solution.  With that out the way, I'm wondering about short secret generation. I've become partial to using a Gaussian distribution to sample from a set of integers. It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations? 

What's the deal?

  My guess is it's from around 1995, as it mentions Cray Computers going bankrupt and Convex purchase by HP.

  On page 5 it mentions that embarrassingly parallel problems *form only a small fraction of the problem set at NSA.*


  They prefer vector computers with a single large memory over (new at the time) MPP machines with thousands of processors and distributed memory.  
  


  It made me wonder what they were working on. Isn't most cryptanalysis embarrassingly parallel? Or maybe they focused on problems that don't scale well without a fast interconnect e.g. linear algebra?",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past. And asking them to train their infosec and opsec teams to learn how to deal with these algorithms that slow down performance will be a difficult task.",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

NOTE = I don't know if I'll release the code on github, surely at the moment it's a bit messy :P",2024-12-04 00:57:05.729110

i think the approach on security in this app is unique and i would like to know which vulnerabilities i haven't considered. i try to answer all concerns in [this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityAdvice/comments/1ev5kqn/is_this_a_secure_messaging_app/).

i think if i stick to the principle of avoiding using any kind of ""required"" service provider (myself included) and allowing the frontend and the peerjs-server to be hosted independently, im on track for creating a chat system with the ""fewest moving parts"". im hope you will agree this is true p2p and i hope i can use this as a step towards unparalleled privacy and security.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
