Despite bullish efforts to push higher, selling pressure at this key level proved too strong, forcing UNI into a downward move. This failure to sustain gains above $12.3 has raised concerns about a potential deeper retracement, as sellers look to capitalize on the weakness. With bearish pressure mounting, UNI’s price action suggests that bulls may need to regroup before attempting another breakout. Will the token find support and recover, or is a deeper decline on the horizon?  Why Bulls Failed To Break $12.3: Market Sentiment Explained Uniswap’s failure to break past the $12.3 resistance level highlights a shift in market sentiment, where bearish pressure outweighed bullish momentum. Despite multiple attempts by buyers to push higher, the resistance proved too strong, leading to increased selling activity. This suggests that traders saw $12.3 as a key take-profit zone, reducing upward strength and allowing bears to regain control. Related Reading: Uniswap Stays On Course For More Gains – $12.3 Resistance In Sight Another factor contributing to the rejection is overall market uncertainty. If broader crypto market conditions remain weak or investors hesitate to commit to higher price levels, bullish breakouts become harder to sustain. Uniswap trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) combined with a weakening RSI indicates significant bearish pressure. The 100-day SMA, often seen as a key indicator of the longer-term trend, suggests that the market sentiment is tilted toward selling.  Additionally, the ongoing decline in the RSI indicates that selling pressure is growing stronger. As the indicator drops below the 50% level and moves closer to the oversold zone, it implies that bearish movement is picking up pace. For Uniswap to regain strength, buyers must reclaim momentum and establish strong support to fuel another breakout attempt. Until then, market sentiment leans bearish, keeping the risk of further downside in play. Key Support Levels To Watch As Uniswap Slides As Uniswap slides lower, key support levels will be crucial in determining whether the price can stabilize or if more declines are likely. The first notable support lies around $10.3, which has historically acted as a base for price action. If UNI fails to hold this level, the next area of support to watch is around $8.7, where the price could find more significant buying interest. Related Reading: Uniswap Consolidates At $17: A Calm Before The Bullish Storm? Should both levels be breached, UNI might face deeper declines, with $6.7 as the next key support level. These support zones will be key indicators for traders looking to determine whether the price can stabilize or if the bearish momentum will continue to drive UNI lower.

This follows his revelation that a bearish pattern that once led to a market crash in the last cycle has returned for the flagship crypto.  Bearish Divergence That Led To Market Crash Returns For Bitcoin Price In an X post, Kevin Capital revealed that the bearish divergence that led to the market crash in the last cycle has returned for the Bitcoin price. He highlighted how bearish this pattern is, noting that the only chart that keeps him up at night at the moment is the bearish divergence on the weekly time frame for BTC.  Related Reading: Is The Crypto Market ‘Satiated’ For Now? Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move He noted how this pattern formed for the Bitcoin price at the same time it did in the last cycle, causing a big dip back then. However, the crypto analyst then alluded to what happened after the market crash as BTC recovered following this period. As such, he suggested that there was no need to be worried although he advised market participants to prepare through it if this bearish pattern plays out this way.  However, amid the revelation of the bearish pattern, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has provided some optimism for the Bitcoin price. In an X post, he stated that BTC’s mark-up phase is beginning and that the short consolidation appears to be wrapping up. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could rally to as high as $117,000 next.  Crypto analyst CobraVanguard also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price. He stated that BTC has entered an ascending phase after its cup-and-handle formation at $105,000. He predicted that the flagship crypto could rally to as high as $123,000 following the formation of this bullish pattern. The crypto analyst also predicted that BTC could top around $260,000 in this market cycle.  Monthly Close Provides Bullish Outlook For BTC The January monthly close has provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price.

On Monday, BTC dropped to $97K before surging to $106K yesterday. However, the price has since retraced and now consolidates around the $102K mark, keeping investors on edge about its next move. Related Reading: Chainlink Could Target $30 Once It Breaks Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst Top analyst Daan shared key insights from Coinglass, revealing that Bitcoin has mostly traded with a Coinbase discount over the past month, as indicated by the Coinbase premium index. This means that other spot exchanges are pricing BTC higher than Coinbase, signaling increased selling pressure from US investors. A Coinbase premium typically indicates strong demand from institutional and ETF buyers, reinforcing bullish sentiment. However, with the index currently flat, the US market seems indecisive. As Bitcoin consolidates below all-time highs, traders are closely watching whether it can reclaim key resistance levels or face another wave of selling pressure. If BTC breaks above $106K again, a test of the all-time high could follow. However, losing the $100K support level could lead to further downside and extended consolidation. The coming days will be crucial in determining the next phase for Bitcoin. Bitcoin At A Crucial Level As Market Awaits Next Move Bitcoin is at a pivotal moment after failing to retest its all-time high (ATH) and now seeking support to fuel the next leg up. The $110K level remains the key psychological target above ATH, and once BTC breaks and holds above it, the entire market could enter a new bullish phase. Related Reading: Cardano Consolidates Within A Symmetrical Triangle – Expert Sees A 40% Move Once It Breaks Despite recent upside momentum, BTC has struggled to gain a clear breakout, leading to uncertainty among investors. Analysts remain divided—some see this as a natural consolidation before Bitcoin makes its next big move, while others worry about a deeper correction if BTC fails to hold key support levels. Top analyst Daan shared key insights from Coinglass, revealing that Bitcoin has mostly traded with a Coinbase discount over the past month. This means that BTC is priced lower on Coinbase compared to other spot exchanges, indicating that selling pressure is coming primarily from US investors. Historically, a Coinbase premium has signaled strong institutional demand, particularly from ETFs and major financial players. However, with the index currently flat, the US market seems cautious. For BTC to confirm a bullish breakout, holding above $102K and reclaiming $106K is critical. If Bitcoin loses these levels, a retest of $100K support could be imminent, delaying a breakout into price discovery. Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below Key Levels Bitcoin is currently trading at $102,400, showing signs of consolidation as the price remains bounded between the $106K resistance and the $100K support levels. This range has defined Bitcoin’s short-term movements, and a breakout in either direction will likely dictate the next trend. A breakdown below $100K could lead to further consolidation or even a deeper correction, delaying Bitcoin’s bullish breakout. If BTC fails to hold this psychological level, selling pressure could increase, pushing prices lower before any attempt at recovery. On the other hand, reclaiming and holding above $106K would be a major bullish signal, suggesting that price discovery is imminent. This would clear the path for Bitcoin to test its all-time high (ATH) and target the $110K mark, potentially triggering a fresh rally.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum Price Enters Bullish Expansion, Analyst Reveals How High It Can Go In February",2025-02-01 20:00:32+00:00,"Ethereum is still showing signs of upward momentum if you know where to look. The leading altcoin is now in a bullish expansion phase, with analysts predicting that its price could surge past key resistance levels in the coming weeks. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum has entered a bullish expansion phase and is on the verge of a major rally that could push it beyond $4,000 in the short term and to new all-time highs by March. Bullish Expansion Puts Ethereum At $4,500 In February According to Ted, Ethereum has transitioned into its expansion phase after completing two preceding phases of accumulation and manipulation. These phases were mapped out on the 3-hour candlestick timeframe and unfolded in the last two weeks of January.  Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With Rising Channel Pattern The accumulation phase was highlighted by Ethereum trading in a range between the upper and lower ends of $3,520 and $3,185, respectively. Following this accumulation phase, Ethereum entered a brief but volatile manipulation phase between January 27 and January 29 before eventually rebounding at the $3,000 mark.  On January 30, Ethereum officially broke out of the manipulation phase, marking the beginning of the anticipated expansion phase. Ted believes this breakout is a key turning point, as it signals the start of a strong rally. With this expansion phase in mind, crypto analyst Ted predicted that the Ethereum price will rally to at least $4,500 in February before setting its sights on a new all-time high by March.  Notably, the analyst’s outlook is based on a combination of breakout from technical patterns and market sentiment, and he noted that Ethereum’s undervaluation is now coming to light.  ETH’s Breakout Hinges On The $4,000 Price Mark In a separate technical analysis, Ted highlighted that Ethereum is breaking out of a downward-sloping wedge pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe. Based on this pattern, he projected that ETH could reach $4,000 within eight to ten days after the breakout is fully confirmed. His forecast is grounded in Ethereum’s historical price movements, particularly referencing two similar breakouts in 2021 and 2024, both of which resulted in a 40% surge within the same time frame. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forms Falling Wedge Pattern On 1-Day Chart That Suggests 20% Rally Is Coming In another analysis, Ted noted that Ethereum is forming higher lows in the longer timeframe. He emphasized that reclaiming the $4,000 mark is crucial right now, as doing so would pave the way for Ethereum to target new all-time highs. According to his projections, a decisive break above this key level will set the stage for Ethereum to reach between the $9,000 and $10,000 range over the next three to four months. Aside from technical indicators, Pillows pointed to the potential impact of Donald Trump’s involvement in Ethereum. He suggested that Trump’s continued accumulation of ETH could further fuel the rally. One such accumulation is the latest acquisition of $10 million worth of ETH by World Liberty Financial, a crypto company affiliated with Donald Trump and some of his family members. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,261. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

The market remains highly volatile, driven by uncertainty, but recent signs of recovery suggest a shift in sentiment. After days of positive price action, AVAX is showing signs of strength, and analysts are watching closely for a potential breakout. Related Reading: Chainlink Could Target $30 Once It Breaks Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared key insights on X, revealing that AVAX has formed another falling wedge on the daily timeframe. This pattern, widely recognized as a bullish reversal indicator, signals that a massive upside move could follow if AVAX breaks out. Runefelt highlights that the breakout target for AVAX is around $56, aligning with key resistance levels. As the crypto market gears up for a potential bullish phase, Avalanche’s price action in the coming weeks will be crucial. If the wedge formation plays out as expected, AVAX could see a strong rally, attracting renewed investor confidence. However, traders remain cautious, as failure to break above key levels could lead to continued consolidation or even further downside. All eyes are now on Avalanche as it approaches a decisive moment. Avalanche Eyes Breakout Amid Bearish Market Pressure Avalanche has shown signs of recovery in the past few days, surging over 13% from a key support level. This move has sparked optimism among investors, but the broader bearish trend that has dominated the market since late December remains a concern. If AVAX fails to reclaim key supply levels as support, the recent gains could be short-lived, and the downtrend may continue. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that AVAX has formed another falling wedge on the daily timeframe. This pattern is widely considered a bullish reversal signal, suggesting a significant breakout could be on the horizon. According to Runefelt, once AVAX breaks out, the target is set at the top of the pattern at $56—an impressive 64% rally from current levels. However, there are still risks that traders must consider. While a falling wedge breakout could signal the start of a new bullish phase, AVAX must first overcome key resistance levels to confirm a trend reversal. If bulls fail to hold current support levels and push the price above these barriers, AVAX could face further downside pressure. Related Reading: Cardano Consolidates Within A Symmetrical Triangle – Expert Sees A 40% Move Once It Breaks AVAX Price Faces Key Resistance  Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading at $34.4 after a highly volatile Friday, where the price surged to $36.1 before retracing the entire daily move. This rapid price swing reflects the uncertainty in the market as AVAX struggles to find direction. For bulls to confirm a potential reversal, the price must reclaim the $36 mark as soon as possible and establish support above it. Additionally, AVAX needs to hold above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $34.6, a crucial technical level that could determine the short-term trend. A sustained move above these levels would reinforce bullish sentiment and potentially trigger a rally toward higher resistance zones. However, failure to hold above the 200-day EMA could result in increased selling pressure, pushing AVAX toward lower demand levels around $31.7. This would signal a continuation of the bearish trend that has dominated the market since mid-December. Related Reading: Solana Restested A Key Level And Now Faces Resistance – Breakout Next? With the market still experiencing uncertainty and price swings, the coming days will be crucial for AVAX’s trajectory. If bulls regain control and reclaim key levels, a strong upward move could follow. Otherwise, further consolidation or downside movement remains a possibility.

This development has also raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price rallying to $1 soon enough.  Related Reading: Trump Effect? Solana Stablecoin Supply Jumps 73% Since Mid-January Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF Filing Sparks Optimism Of DOGE’s Rally To $1 Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF filing has sparked optimism of a DOGE rally to $1. The New York Stock Exchange already filed the 19b-4 form with the US SEC to list and trade shares of Grayscale’s DOGE Trust. Grayscale is looking to convert the Trust into an ETF, which will make it tradeable on the NYSE.  This Dogecoin ETF filing, which is the third following the one from REX Shares and Bitwise, has further sparked optimism that DOGE could indeed reach the psychological $1 level. A potential Dogecoin ETF is bullish as it would drive institutional inflows into the DOGE ecosystem, sparking further rallies for the foremost meme coin.  Such fundamentals could serve as the catalyst for price predictions made by crypto analysts like Trader Tradigrade, who predicted that DOGE could rally above the $1 mark. In an X post, the crypto analyst remarked that the Dogecoin price is gearing up for a massive rally. His accompanying chart showed that the foremost meme coin could surge past the $1 mark and reach $3.8 when this rally occurs.  News around the Dogecoin ETF could spark a bullish reversal for the Dogecoin price, with this reversal already looking imminent. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade revealed that DOGE’s MACD Golden Cross is approaching. With the ascending triangle pattern and consecutive higher lows, the analyst further remarked that the meme coin could potentially reverse the downtrend into an uptrend.  DOGE’s Uptrend Could Begin This February In a recent X post, crypto analyst Master Kenobi suggested that Dogecoin’s uptrend could begin this February. This came as the analyst alluded to DOGE’s performance last year. He noted that February 4th marked the first signs of an uptrend. With the month of February here again, Master Kenobi raised the possibility of history repeating itself.  However, it is worth mentioning that February isn’t exactly a historically bullish month for Dogecoin,. Since its launch in 2013, the foremost meme coin has recorded only an average monthly gain of 0.81% in February. However, as these analysts have suggested, there is still the possibility of a DOGE rebound this month, replicating the 50% gain recorded in February last year. Ahead of this potential Dogecoin price rebound, Dogecoin whales have been actively accumulating. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that these whales have accumulated 560 million DOGE in the past week, which signals a renewed interest from large holders.  Related Reading: Analyst Explains Bitcoin’s Path To $150,000 – Details At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.32, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,AVAX Price Continues To Consolidate Around $35 — Here Are The Levels To Watch,2025-02-01 15:30:54+00:00,"The AVAX price has been mostly quiet since the start of 2025, mirroring the climate of the altcoin market so far in the new year. After reaching a local high of $55 in early December 2024, the Avalanche token has been in a steady decline, reaching as low as $32.2 on Wednesday, January 29. Investors, Watch Out For These Price Levels In a new post on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed the key on-chain levels that could prove pivotal to the future trajectory of AVAX price. This on-chain observation focuses on the average cost basis of several Avalanche investors. In cost-basis analysis, a zone’s capacity to serve as support or resistance depends on the total amount of tokens last purchased by investors at the level. As shown in the chart below, the size of the dot represents and is directly proportional to the number of AVAX tokens acquired within each corresponding price range. Related Reading: Chainlink Could Target $30 Once It Breaks Bullish Pattern – Top Analyst According to data from IntoTheBlock, around 302,100 addresses purchased approximately 14.26 million AVAX tokens within the price range of $34.01 and $35.15. As highlighted by Martinez, this has led to the formation of a crucial support cushion within this price region. The $34.5 region is able to act as a crucial support level due to the number of investors with their cost basis in and around it. The rationale is that when the AVAX price returns to $34.5, investors with their cost basis around this zone are likely to double down and defend their position by acquiring more tokens, allowing prices to quickly recover. Furthermore, IntoTheBlock data shows that the $39.49 – $40.54 price bracket is currently thick with investors. According to data from IntoTheBlock, more than 233,000 addresses bought over 12.33 million AVAX between the price range. Martinez noted that this $39.49 – $40.54 price region is a major resistance zone because investors are always likely to make a move when an asset returns to their cost basis. In this scenario, investors who were in the red before may want to quickly sell their holdings as soon as they enter profit, which could place downward pressure on the AVAX price. The price action of the AVAX around two regions could make or mar its performance over the next few weeks. Hence, investors might want to pay extra attention to the altcoin whenever it approaches these support and resistance zones. AVAX Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of AVAX stands at around $34.8, reflecting a mere 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

However, recent on-chain data suggests that stablecoins are back and have surpassed the $200 billion market cap. Related Reading: XRP $10 Price Tag Hinges On SEC Lawsuit Conclusion, Analyst Says According to the data shared by Alphractal, the segment’s capitalization has surged to $211 billion, a record high, thanks to months of stable growth, which started in mid-2023. Stablecoins‘ market capitalization grew by 73% from its August 2023 value of $121 billion, updated data released on January 31st show. The primary driver of this segment’s growth is still Tether’s USDT, however, USDC has been gaining ground recently, which is fascinating. 🚨 Stablecoin Market Cap Surpasses $211B – USDC Gains Momentum! Since 2023, the stablecoin market has grown significantly, mainly driven by USDT (Tether). However, recently, USDC has been gaining an edge over other stablecoins. This trend is occurring due to the recent drop in… pic.twitter.com/IRKrQErmCE — Alphractal (@Alphractal) January 31, 2025 Tether’s USDT Remains Primary Driver Of Growth Since 2023, the stablecoin market has grown steady, mostly due to Tether’s USDT. As of now, stablecoins are worth $223 billion, which is a 0.2% increase from yesterday. Interestingly, USDT and USDC are the present growth drivers of stablecoins. Apart from the numbers from both coins, the stablecoins group hasn’t changed much since 2023 and has shown steady and average values. Right now, Tether’s USDT is valued at almost $140 billion, and USDC is at $53 billion. USDC Slowly Gains Ground On Other Coins Alphractal’s post on Twitter/X shows that USDC has been gaining ground over other stablecoins in the market. According to the post, this is happening due to a drop in altcoin prices and since a substantial part of the sell-offs have been swapped into USDC. The post also showed that USDC’s dominance in this segment has hit a key resistance level, the same amount observed in 2021. This was the start of the bear market in 2022 when Bitcoin’s price dropped to as low as $15,500. If this metric persists, it can serve as the market’s bearish signal, impacting investors’ buying decisions. However, if this metric declines, it can be USDC’s jumping board to claim new highs. Related Reading: 21Shares Bets On Polkadot, Files For Spot ETF With SEC What To Expect From The Stablecoins Segment In The Short-Term In the last bull run, USDC’s supply increased in May, then reached its high in March 2022. The stablecoin’s market cap increased by 170% from April 2021 to March 2022. If the current coin supply continues to grow but price starts to dip, then the stablecoin market may hit its peak in a few months. Traditionally, a rising market cap for stablecoins reflects growing investors’ confidence, which signals an increase in capital inflows. On the contrary, a rising stablecoin market cap is usually associated with growing investor conviction, signaling the potential for boosted capital inflows. This suggests that the bullish momentum could continue for a few more months. Featured image from Gemini Imagen, chart from TradingView",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Top Presale $MIND to Help You Make Crazy Gains in This Bull Run,2025-02-01 13:47:28+00:00,"Bitcoin has been the blue-eyed boy for crypto investors, making millions during its rise. While some investors adopt the ‘buy and forget’ approach, it might not be ideal for the average trader. Taking out occasional profits becomes essential to invest in better opportunities to pay your bills. However, in a rally that never seems to stop, it can be hard to time your exit perfectly. Here are some tools that can help you plan your exits better. The Active Address Sentiment Indicator (AASI) maps the relationship between Bitcoin price and network activity. It measures the deviation between the two metrics, which is marked by the orange lines – the wider the gap between the two lines, the stronger the signal is deemed to be. As you can see in the image above, there were multiple exit signals during Jan 2021 and May 2021. The highest exit price was $63,000. The Fear and Greed Index is another useful exit indicator. Any value more than 90 depicts extreme greed among market participants. Usually, such times of greed are followed by sharp corrections. In 2021, the index suggested an exit at $14,000 when the value peaked at 95. Next is the Short-Term Holder MVRV, which compares the current Bitcoin prices with the average cost of short-term holders. This helps to arrive at a figure that shows the average unrealized profit or loss. The more this number rises, the higher the chances that a profit booking may follow, as short-term investors look to take home some gains. Usually, an unrealized profit above 66% suggests that a pullback is around the corner. Now, tracking these indicators on a regular basis can be overwhelming and may not be possible for everyone. This is where AI agents like $MIND of Pepe ($MIND) come in handy. What is $MIND? $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that interacts with various market participants and engages with influencers and communities on platforms like X to simplify the crypto information overload. In the process, $MIND generates actionable insights and signals for all token holders. This self-evolving AI agent helps sieve down the information overload and offers access to early trends and investment opportunities. Traditional tools, like the indexes mentioned above, are often lagging indicators and do not offer real-time information. However, $MIND converts real-time data, as new as milliseconds ago, into decision-making tools through hive-mind analysis. This gives token holders an early-mover advantage and identifies trends before they become mainstream. Why Can $MIND Be the Next 100x Token? AI agents like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) help participants stay one step ahead of other crypto investors. Unlike other meme coins, $MIND doesn’t just rely on the hype of a meme figure to churn out yields for investors. It offers all token holders actual, real-time, actionable information, which can actually make them profitable crypto investors in the long run. No wonder $MIND is being touted as the next 100x token after $DOGE and $PEPE. The project also boasts solid tokenomics. Out of the total supply of 100B tokens, 30% is reserved for the long-term development of the project. This depicts the long-term commitment of the developers. Furthermore, 15% of the token supply has been kept specifically for staking and community incentives. Visit the official $MIND website for more information. $MIND, the best AI agent coin, is currently in presale, where it has already raised over $4.7M. If you get in now, you can buy $MIND for just $0.0032402 each. However, with a price increase set to happen in less than 2 days, this can be your last shot at such a low price. All you need to do to purchase $MIND is connect your crypto wallet (we recommend Best Wallet) on the official $MIND presale website and ensure you have enough funds to complete the purchase. Next, punch in the number of $MIND tokens you want to buy and approve the transaction from your wallet. With all that said, we’d also like to offer a word of advice: always do your own research before putting any money in crypto assets. Also, this article isn’t financial advice, and you must only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,5 Altcoins That Could Explode After Stablecoin Volume Surges $200B,2025-02-01 13:24:54+00:00,"After expanding by nearly $40B since Donald Trump’s victory in the US election, the stablecoin market has now soared past the $200B mark as far as market capitalization is concerned. One of the biggest reasons behind this terrific growth has been the increased use of bots, especially on Solana. It’s worth noting that stablecoins are an integral part of the crypto economy, seeing as they simplify switching between different crypto assets. A growth in stablecoin’s liquidity means more and more people are being onboarded in the crypto industry, which is a hugely positive sign for the overall crypto market. All in all, it’d be safe to say that we’re on the cusp of yet another crypto bull run, which could be bigger and more rewarding than any we’ve seen so far. This is, therefore, the best time to invest in these 5 high-potential altcoins that could explode alongside crypto’s growth. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Overall Best Altcoin to Buy In 2025 As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to boost Solana’s utility by getting rid of several critical issues it has begun facing because of its popularity. These include the concerning frequency at which transactions get declined on the network, which is a result of too much congestion and limited scalability. Thanks to Solaxy’s multi-chain nature (it combines the best of Ethereum and Solana), it will be able to smoothen operations by bundling transactions through batch processing. This will not only result in higher throughputs but also reduce overall costs. Another reason to be bullish on Solaxy is the attention its presale has received from both retailers and whales. With over $17M raised in its ongoing presale, $SOLX’s current price of $0.001622 is an attractive entry point for early adopters. If you’d like some help through the buying process, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $SOLX. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Token of the Best Crypto Wallet Available Right Now Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of Best Wallet App, a well-rounded crypto wallet that exhibits serious potential of fulfilling its promise to control over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet industry by 2026. Best Wallet supports more than 60 blockchains, allowing users to manage almost all their crypto assets from a single platform. Additionally, you get the ability to execute easy and quick cross-chain swaps, thanks to a built-in decentralized exchange called Best DCS. $BEST token holders will receive an array of benefits within the Best Wallet ecosystem, including the right to vote on critical decisions regarding the project’s future. What’s more, you’ll also benefit from reduced transaction fees and early access to hyped and high-potential projects, as well as staking rewards of 197%. The $BEST presale has performed exceedingly well, with over $8.8M in funding at the time of writing. 1 $BEST is currently available for just $0.023825, and you can buy $BEST by either visiting its official presale website or directly from the Best Wallet App on your Android or iOS device. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Unlock Real-Time Investment Advice with Hive-Mind Analysis MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is one of the hottest crypto presales of 2025, which is hardly a surprise seeing as it titillates not one but two high-potential segments: the AI space and finance bros. Plus, it carries the OG Pepe meme’s appeal, which is not to be taken lightly, either. $MIND is an AI agent that interacts with crypto enthusiasts and communities on platforms like X. Next, and the most interesting bit, is that $MIND is self-evolving; it scans everything that’s being said in the market, forms its own opinions, drives trends and conversations according to its bias, and identifies early-stage investment opportunities for the token holders. The MIND of Pepe presale is growing every minute, and it currently boasts over $4.7M in funding. The best AI agent coin is currently available for just $0.0032402, but interested investors should hurry up because prices increase in the next 40 hours. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Solana Meme Coin Based on Fart Jokes Fartcoin started out as a joke. After all, the whole idea that you can claim free tokens by submitting fart jokes is absurd, isn’t it? However, it doesn’t have to make sense to make you money – which should be the ethos of $FARTCOIN that now has a market capitalization of more than $850M. Make the mistake of thinking that $FARTCOIN is all fun and games at your own peril – it’s a ‘serious’ meme coin that hit all-time highs of around $2.40 early this year, jumping 300% in just two weeks, resulting in massive gains for early investors. Although Fartcoin is down quite a fair bit right now, the current price of $0.86 offers a discounted entry point for long-term investors. 5. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Meme Coin Twist to the S&P 500 Index If you thought Fartcoin had a weird theme, wait till you hear about SPX6900. With a market cap of over $1B, SPX6900 is an Ethereum-based altcoin that blends humor with finance, offering a meme coin twist to the S&P 500 index, which is one of the biggest and baddest stock market indexes in the world. Although you can argue that $SPX is all hype and no logic, there’s little to no room for debate about its potential. It’s up over 67,000% in the last year, and an active social media community (80K followers on X and over 19K subscribers on its Telegram) means that there could still be room for more growth. Bottom Line Having mentioned the 5 best altcoins that could explode in 2025, it’s important to mention that the crypto market isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, and it can have its fair share of ups and downs as well. This is why you must be careful about how much you put into the market. Plus, you must do your own research (DYOR) before investing because that will give you the required confidence to stick with your bets. Lastly, none of the above is financial advice, and we merely hope to offer our best opinions and insights.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,solana,⚠️ Ongoing scam on Reddit BE AWARE!,2025-02-01 15:54:24,"Recently I was browsing a Reddit page and found many comments with a concerning number of upvotes regarding a sub named \`WhalesOnSol\`. 

https://preview.redd.it/v0czvqcwtjge1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf74582677f3e8f4df80bba09b7e69f498f25205

I checked out the sub and as expected, it was private. So I sent a message to the mods, and after a few hours, I got a message with a Google Forms link in it.

The form asks for simple information such as whether you agree to their terms ..etc but what caught my eye was this part of the form. 

https://preview.redd.it/oqy463s3sjge1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c1c4c3bc6954c1238af71e4fd49e4ff5a560283

The link there leads to a link to a Telegram group chat with about \~1250 members, this made it seem legitimate. 

https://preview.redd.it/4pane1nfsjge1.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=4173a681ab5563d57b94c869665f8140b616e16e

And here's where the hacking part begins. 

Once you click Verify, you're greeted with the same screen that SafeGuard uses. However, once you click ""Verify"" again on the page, you're presented with a fake Telegram login screen with a QR on it. DO NOT SCAN IT. 

When I was testing, the bot was an embed of \`bullx(dot su)\`, which is designed as a Bullx phishing page.

https://preview.redd.it/qz41i4yeujge1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=2513b0926f212bb93407d4efbe060018a414d8d4

Once a victim scans it, the hacker instantly gets access to the victim's Telegram account, which will lead to their wallets being drained (ex: Telegram bots, Bullx). 

I wanted to let everyone know about this as this is such a sophisticated way of attacking. Please report the sub and everything related to it.

In any other community, projects, projections, ideas are discussed, and the only thing the ""investor"" here posts is

\- Guys, I can't exchange this token, could I have been hacked? (he posts an image where he CLEARLY says he doesn't have enough for the fee)



\- Guys, I sold my house and invested in Elon Musk's new token, Scammocoin. I made a billion but I can't withdraw it. Could I have been scammed?????????



\- Guys, you won't believe it, the Prince of Nigeria just called me on Telegram and asked for my phrase, he said he's going to transfer all his fortune to me, but so far I'm only seeing my $100 worth of bitcoin that took me 9 years to save disappearing, could this be a scam?



Absolutely everything would be avoided with 5 minutes of reading, but it seems that here there are only children and teenagers trying their luck in the memecoin roulette, considering this, will the Solana token really ever be taken seriously?

Reddit,solana,exchange or cold wallet and why?,2025-02-01 22:32:28,I genuinely want to hear from everyone what they think is better…. Exchange (if so what one) or cold wallet (if so what one) AND or both? I think it’s interesting I see so many people saying cold wallet and all the while I don’t necessarily disagree…. Have you guys thought of the Palisades fires that just happened and how many possible cold wallets / keys were burned in that fire? What happens if your safe gets stolen or your house burns or something you know? It’s just gone…. If you have it on an exchange you can at-least have a track record of it and someone to hold accountable potentially if there is an issue? Idk. I wanna know! Pros and cons! So many questions!!

Reddit,solana,The Billionaires are meddling in  crypto and reaping retail investors quickly and slowly,2025-01-31 22:41:14,"
The crypto market today is a battlefield dominated by billionaires running coordinated cons against retail investors. From celebrity meme coins to the AI narrative, from Murad’s list of “approved” tokens to the Bitcoin ETF hype, everything is designed to extract liquidity from everyday traders and funnel it into the hands of the elite.
	•	Celebrity Coins: These are blatant cash grabs where influencers launch tokens, pump them through social media, and dump on their own followers. The result? Retail gets wrecked, while the celebrities and their insider teams walk away with millions.
	•	AI Narrative: Every major financial cycle has its golden gimmick, and AI is the latest. AI-powered crypto projects are being marketed as revolutionary, but most are just vaporware with no real-world adoption.
	•	Murad’s List: Hedge funds and institutions play a different game, quietly accumulating assets before making them “investable” for the masses. By the time a coin makes it onto these curated lists, the upside is already gone, and retail is left buying the top.
	•	Bitcoin ETF Manipulation: The ETF approval brought a wave of institutional money, but it’s clear that the game is rigged. Institutions use ETF flows to control Bitcoin’s price, squeezing out retail traders and extracting profits through market manipulation.

The Only Real Play Left: Finding a Quality CTO Project

With all this noise, retail investors are left searching for the few legitimate opportunities that billionaires haven’t yet flooded with their capital. The answer? Finding a strong Community Takeover (CTO) project before it enters the mainstream. A successful CTO means that a project is no longer in the hands of a corrupt dev or insider VC firms but is instead guided by its community.

Reddit,solana,Screwing with millionaire rugpullers,2025-02-01 09:03:16,"I am not sure whether this is allowed here. I got the impression that rugpulling is considered unethical, while there is also not much sympathy for people being rugpulled, because they should know what they are doing. The problem is: The more money these rugpullers earn, the more they can screw with others. And they DO screw with others. They will accept losses of 100s of thousends of dollars, just to make sure that no one else profits. And that is how they are vulnerable. An investment of 5$ per coin can cost them 100s of thousands. Which may lead them to adapt their strategies, if it happens every time. 

  
Anyway, some basics:

If you invest 100$ and can reliable earn 10% per day, you will have 128.330.558.031.335.400$ at the end of the year. Just to remind people of exponential growth. If there is only single instance with 0% growth (no loss, though), the end result will be 116.664.143.664.850.350 €. Meaning one instance where you could screw with an investor one time would cost them 12 quadrillion dollars. 

Of course that is a fictional example that can not be realized. I am talking about a real world example, where the address Htft4xNX3ZBZnkcHzH8xhtFekhHY5FaGZjDERYpKanGE invests around 700,000$ into Barron/Ivanka tokens. They will usually get at least 50% gains every hour. This doesn'T include fees and other costs, of course. But there will likely still a substantial gain. 

Let's say that entity can gain 25% reliably for 10 times. The end result will be 65.192.580$. If they gain 0% for one single time, the end result will be 60.160.979$, about 5,000,000$ difference. And you can manage that with just a 5$ investment. 

How? They track investors and don't want anyone alse profiting with them. If you invest in their coins, then sell after gains of 20%, then invest again, they will identify your account and blacklist it. After that, even a 5$ investment from your account will cause them to rugpull early, costing them a lot of money.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Steps:

* 2 - Create Liquidity Pool 
* 3 - Create Pre Sale from Liquidity Pool (Burn all unsold)
* 4 - Air Drop to community
* 5 - List on Dex

* **40%** Vested Dev team shares (The intent here is to remain in ""control"" of the token via an amount that cannot be sold/traded for a time period to block rug pulls/etc. 
* **10%** Whitelist - at a discount from listing on dex?
* **25%** Multiple Air Drop campaigns - this is a community project.
* **25%** Available for sale at launch

Reddit,solana,What do you think of Kamino Multiply to earn up to 30% yield on SOL?,2025-01-31 21:49:56,"Kamino's Multiply on Solana is a looping leverage strategy. Basically you deposit SOL or an LST, like jitoSOL, for example. Multiply increases the jitoSOL position by borrowing SOL, swapping to jitoSOL and repeating several times. So if you start with say 100 SOL, you can effectively hold I guess maybe 180 SOL worth of staked SOL, so you end up earning maybe 15% to 30% yield on your SOL instead of just 12%.

Here is what they say about risk:

>A Multiply position can be liquidated **if the borrow interest rate is higher than the LST yield for a sustained period of time,** thus increasing your debt relative to the LST enough to reach the liquidation threshold.

>Liquidation can also occur if the LST platform's smart contract is exploited.

>LST depegs can no longer cause liquidations for Multiply positions.

So what are the chances of liquidation? This is the important question that I'm struggling with.

Looking at the chart provided on the mSOL Multiply page, I see 4 times in about a year where the APY for 5x leverage spiked negative for maybe a day, then quickly recovered. Would that cause liquidations? They say rates need to be negative for ""a sustained period of time"", but that could be hours, days, weeks, months?

What do you think of Mulitply and the risks?

Any idea how to guesstimate the chances of liquidation?

* Miss manipulation patterns in L2 sequencer data
* No temporal analysis of state changes
* Zero understanding of account behavior over time

>**Ship or Die**  
  
The worst thing a high-functioning but successful organization can do is become complacent, opaque and inundated with process  
  
In an effort to be more transparent, I'm laying out some of our technical product strategy for 2025. Here's what we're focusing on:



>**1/** **Passkey Wallet Infrastructure**  
  
The secp256r1 precompile coming in 2.2 unlocks a new era for smart wallets on Solana:  
\- Sign with FaceID  
\- Passkey login and Signin  
\- MPC wallets w/ biometric backups  
  
We're looking for teams to build example implementations and are helping teams integrate. We’re also supporting teams building infrastructure around this new curve

>  
**2/ Gasless Relayers**  
  
The Solana account model makes it extremely easy to pay for fees for other users. We're building a new gasless relayer to make it easier to pay for fees and use fees as a loyalty play  
  
Check out the spec: [https://forum.solana.com/t/srfc-34-standardized-relayer-api/2876](https://forum.solana.com/t/srfc-34-standardized-relayer-api/2876)

>  
**3/ Solana Onchainkit**  
  
Blinks did a great job at making it easier to interact with programs but we want to push this further. We want to build the universal [@Solana](https://x.com/Solana) SDK:  
  
\- Standardized interface for every program  
\- Easier program composition  
\- Better transaction building  
\- Domain Resolution, Swaps, Fund w/ offramp, mint, etc



>  
**4/ On-chain Attestation Infrastructure**  
  
T22 extensions and attestations enable true institutional-grade permissioned systems on a permissionless chain. We're building SAS (Solana Attestation Service) for:  
\- Anti-sybil checks  
\- Accredited investor verification  
\- Trusted KYC signaling  
\- Other use cases of trusted offchain data  
  
We're looking to help teams that want to use onchain attestations for products like permissioned vaults and accredited/non-sybiled airdrops

The Solana read layer needs an overhaul. We're building a new independent version of the RPC and are experimenting with a more plug-and-play version that work in specific modes. E.g. historical accounts, streaming, simulate or just just JsonRPC  
  
Looking for a lot of ideas here as we start to build the spec and share it with the community (especially wrt: geyser)

>  
**7/ Mobile Tooling**  
  
Crypto is going mobile-first and our tooling needs to be best-in-class  
  
We're putting a lot of effort into making:  
\- Wallet adapter  
\- Mobile wallet adapter (kotlin)  
\- Mobile wallet adapter (swift)  
  
Spec compliant, usable and taking advantage of native features like FaceId,  secure enclave, NFC and more



>**8/ Token Extension Tooling**  
  
As we push to get more T22 adoption and integrations, we need to facilitate better tooling for minting, composing upon and making T22 more usable in payments and defi  
  
As scaled ui amount and IBE tokens get more attention we need to make sure explorers, wallets and apps support them in a meaningful and similar manner

  


>**9/ Usage Billed APIs**  
  
Similar to HTTP 402 Payment Required we're looking to extend functionality to support SPL-based billing for consuming API calls. We're experimenting with durable nonces, payment state channels and escrows to charge API consumers in crypto as a reverse proxy that sits in front of your server

>  
**10/ Security**  
  
Last year, we had very successful outcomes for our Security RFPs for monitoring and static analysis  
  
This year, we're looking to extend this with formal verification, differential fuzzing and token and account risk analysis.   
  
Additionally, for our AI goals, we'll put time into code understanding (think fine tuned Solana models and OSS datasets) for web3js and on-chain program development

>  
If you want to get involved in any of the above, have feedback, think of new ideas, please reach out! We'll have RFPs, grants, bounties and working groups for many of these as we look to continue to make Solana the best place to build products with real users and meaningful volumes

Edit: For those of you asking if I’m new, I am new to meme coins. I’ve never seen any value. I am not new to crypto.

I’ve been in bitcoin since 2012 or so. I bought in because I worked as a cyber security engineer on an early ransomeware case. I ended up buying bitcoin to pay the ransom by meeting a guy off Craigslist to buy a few bitcoin to pay the ransom. Since I didn’t want to have to do this in the future I bought a few to hold as well. Not because I was investing in some crypto but because people have been hacking for years for fee, bitcoin allowed them to get paid. I saw that as a huge reason for a need of bitcoin. So while I didn’t think it would go up as much as it I’d, I certainly didn’t think it was going to go down so I felt ok buying a few thousand dollars worth (luckily I forgot about it and sold a few years later for an insane amount of money).

This is not what meme coins are. They’re not adding a new value. Eth added smart contracts that’s valuable. Solana added speed that’s also valuable.

**What I've tried:**

- Using the search endpoint: `https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/search?q=raydium+solana`

- Attempted different queries and parameters

- Checked the API documentation

- Access to all or at least more Solana/Raydium pairs

- Ability to monitor newly launched pairs

- Real-time or near real-time data

Has anyone found a way to get more than 30 pairs from the API? Or is there perhaps an alternative endpoint I should be using?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

It got me thinking—why do so many people dismiss the platform as just a pump-and-dump machine? of course that is what it is currently being used for...but it could also be used for legit use cases, ignoring the desperate pump and dumpers.

Could a platform like pump.fun be a real tool for raising funds? If you're upfront to your fans about holding a token and using profits to build something valuable, is that really a rug? Or is it just a way for early supporters and the creator to actually benefit?

Think about a small music band. I used to follow obscure artists—some blew up, some didn’t, but supporting them felt meaningful either way. Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invest in a band early and see your stake grow as they did? Even if you never cashed out, you'd still be part of something bigger.

I truly think people are missing something here. After using Pump.fun myself, I see how it could be a powerful way to fund creative projects. (My main contention being - If your community supports you, why would you ever want to rug them?)

Curious ... Am I off base, or is there potential here? 

I am considering using it as a way to support my documentary making on Youtube, because it is very costly to make them - I feel like it could be a good alternative beyond Patreon - But I wanted to get actual feedback from people who are closer/more knowledgeable than I am.

Wether you know something like it that already exists, think its a great idea, think it's a shite idea, want to team up or steal the idea, all feedback is welcome.

So having been involved in a number of Memecoin CTOs there is often a call for the community to donate a small amount of SOL to a donation/marketing wallet that can be used to promote the project, pay for DEX etc. The issue is no one trusts anyone so deciding whose wallet the contributions go to is always a challenge.

The idea is to have a dApp that has a wallet that has funds that can only be released by a majority vote made by all contributors (possibly weighted by your contribution size). So as an example, we raise 5 SOL for a trending placement, but in order to release that 5 SOL all contributors need to agree.

I’ve been into blockchain tech since around 2014, but have never had time to really develop anything cool. I’ve been doing research into Solana and it seems easier to create your own tokens and it’s a hell of a lot faster and easier to build smart contracts (programs I know) on this chain then dealing with Solidity on Ethereum. 

I’ve had several ideas for tokens & programs that actually could do cool things. Stuff like some gamification and anchoring to real world events that offer tokens as rewards. I don’t want to launch coins that just screw people over, I’d rather make cool things that generate some revenue for me and other users. I’ve also been working for other companies for long enough and would love to start my own projects to help add some extra money for my family and friends. 

The documentation is pretty solid and rust is relativity straight forward. Before I get started, I was wondering what the “legality” of this stuff is? 

Many of you guys have coins you have created and are earning revenue. One of the few good things about the current administration is that they are very pro crypto and deregulatory - seems like the perfect time to start my projects.

Reddit,solana,Identify whether this is a bot or a human?,2025-01-30 18:13:34,"Hello, I've been doing some research to find and see some wallet's activity to see if I can use as a base to see what I should be looking for. The current wallet I found has about a 94% profitability but the transactions and activity don't really seem to be that of a bot. 

Based on the transaction activity, the operating hours of the wallet appear to be from 7:00 AM the earliest to about 8 PM the latest, which is a pretty normal time period for a human to be trading.  I've yet to see a transaction earlier or later than this time period. 

Also, the wallet makes very little transactions. The number ranges from 1-4 transactions daily. There are no sporadic number of transactions made, they are all early buys that are held and net amazing profits.

The amount of money invested isn't exorbitant or miniscule either. I've seen $400 on the bottom end to as much as $11,000. $11,000 is quite a lot, but in comparison to the profit the wallet has made, it's very small. 

The one confusing thing is that they seem to be a very very VERY early buyer in a coin, and most of the coins they purchasing range from 15x to 200x profits. 

Which pretty much concludes this wallet is a sniper but I'm unsure whether it's a bot or not and wanted to see what kind of bot and parameters could possibly net this kind of success. 

If anyone else has seen something like this and had any sort of insight, I would love to know. Thank you ",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Looking to launch our first utility with meme branding on Solana and a lot of people have said the only option is swing trading and liquidating for marketing/dev funds, which doesn’t sound appealing to me. But with the pumpfun meta, it seems like a custom contract with say a 2% tax might kill us before we even start. Our utility is ready to be live at launch and it requires backend work from a software team so funds will need to be generated. Is it realistic to say that the 2% tax is not an option and no one will be interested? 

We have a catchy name and unique utility but I’m worried if we don’t launch on pump it won’t get any exposure or trust. Lmk what you guys think, but my gut says pumpfun is the only way to go nowadays. ",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to encrypt data inside a smart contract on Ethereum?,2025-01-30 22:00:52,"Hello, everyone!

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

So, my question is: is there any way to encrypt data within Ethereum using another person's public key, whether with RSA, ECC, or some other approach? Has anything been developed to achieve this?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,ethereum,Does Solana have an “Admin Dashboard” by which the SOL Gods can eliminate a project at will?,2025-01-30 22:45:52,"Alex Becker put out a video yesterday in which he posited that ETH will eventually surpass SOL because SOL has an “admin dashboard” — meaning that, if the **powers that be** want to terminate a project on SOL, then they can do so with the push of a button. However on ETH this is not as directly possible. Hence, (according to Alex) ETH will be the go-to crypto token for future developers, who are skittish about government intervention.

**Is this claim warranted?**

I’m unfamiliar with the debate so thanks for reading!

The challenge is that I only have the recipient's **Ethereum address**, but encryption typically requires their **public key**.

Since Ethereum addresses are derived from the public key but don’t expose it directly, I’m looking for the best approach to encrypt data for a recipient without having their full public key beforehand.

How to tackel this any idea??

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

Reddit,ethereum,I cant understand all this.,2025-01-26 15:40:20,"I'm currently preparing for in campus placements, and working on data structure and algorithms for hiring rounds. Meanwhile two people of my class magically somehow appear announce events about web3 blockchain etc etc and I'm not sure how they started getting funding for it. They went to Bangalore for some meetup, conducted some meetups in my city and now they arr going to eth denver, one of them posted about the visa approval and tickets to the event. I was stunned. I talked to them and they have become literally so arrogant about giving information, and said they don't give a fuck to studies of college. I'm not sure what they are doing to achieve so but for student like me willing to study hard, and earn success gets insecure about not knowing everything hi fi going [around.Read](http://around.Read) more

Reddit,ethereum,I've created a Game and hidden seed words throughout it.,2025-01-25 10:07:53,"Hi reddit, I challenge you all.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

We hope you love it and have a nice day. **�**�",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO.

(v)    taking measures to protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States, including by prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States.

OpenAI, Meta, and Orange recently announced efforts to build AI for African languages. But here’s the catch: Africa has 2,000+ languages, many with little to no digital data. Without datasets, even the best AI models can’t bridge this gap.

**What We’re Doing:**  
We’re a nonprofit team building a blockchain and tokenomics-powered solution to crowdsource, validate, and incentivize the creation of African language datasets. Think decentralized data ownership, community-driven contributions, and equitable AI access.

**Who We Are:**

\- A team of **4 founders with 27+ combined years** in product development, startups, and AI/data systems.

\- Backgrounds: **AI engineer, Data Engineer, Statistician, Product Engineer, Non-profit and Funding**

\- Committed to impact over profit (**nonprofit structure**).

**We Need You:**

\- Blockchain/tokenomics expertise (Solana, Polygon, smart contracts, token design).

\- Technical enough to lead protocol development.

\- Aligned with the mission: Solve the data desert for African languages.

We've been locking these threads because many of the commenters can't manage to stay on-topic when posting in threads that have anything to do with current politics. Many of the comments in these threads used to be insults, arguing about politics, and off-topic political commentary, and not about Bitcoin. But now after Trump's meme coin was recently released, more of the comments in these threads end up being about his shitcoin. It's typical for half of the comments in Trump related threads to either be about his shitcoin or about politics now, and not about bitcoin. This is why we've been locking these threads lately.

This is the Bitcoin subreddit. This is not the Trumpcoin sub. So stop commenting about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin. Everybody in this sub is aware of Trump's shitcoin. You don't need to keep posting about it. If you want to post comments about Trump's shitcoin, then head over to the sub for it and stop spamming about it in r\/Bitcoin. **Anybody that posts about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

This is not a politics subreddit. Stop posting off-topic political commentary in r\/Bitcoin. There are countless political subreddits where you can post about politics unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not one of them. **Anybody that posts political comments that are not about Bitcoin in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

Subsequent rule violators will be banned for longer than 1 week if we notice that you're a repeat offender.

Reddit,bitcoin,“Bitcoin is not backed by anything”,2025-02-01 11:38:48,"I was recently watching a finance podcast where the host responded to a question by someone pro Bitcoin. The host responded that “Bitcoin is all speculation and is not backed by anything”. 

Having read the white paper Satoshi makes a mention of the value at least being that of the energy expenditure to mine bitcoin and secure the network.

I somewhat get the concept of proof of work and energy being tied to value but is there a better explanation to bitcoins value besides this and a good rebuttal to someone saying it’s purely speculation?

Another reason I ask this is I recently found out that between the year 2100-2200 there will only be one bitcoin left to mine, and so, 100 years is a lot of energy to pump into one bitcoin. So with this in mind it makes sense for the price to very closely be correlated to energy consumption cost - if energy becomes really cheap by then what does that do to the cost of a bitcoin?

Please correct me if any of my statements are incorrect or misleading.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin thesis from 2020,2025-02-01 20:47:02,"This understanding of bitcoin is what kept me through the bear market

Bitcoin value proposition 

Metcalfe’s law
- concept of a ""network effect"" in that the value of a network provides both additional value and a competitive advantage.
- In the context of financial transactions, larger networks would seem to have more value than smaller networks.
- Consider the invention of the telephone, internet, eBay, and Facebook
- https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoins-network-effect/
- https://caia.org/sites/default/files/metcalfeslaw_websiteupload_7-5-18
- “Crypto adoption is now massively outperforming the internet. It’s been growing at about 165% a year versus 85% for the internet for the same period of time now. This is the fastest adoption of any technology in all human history.”
- Exponential increase in hash rate (security) and distribution of miners across the globe. 
- This year Bitcoin crossed over $100 trillion in cumulative transfer volume, with roughly $105 trillion having been settled on the network in total. This is a tremendous feat, illustrating how millions around the world have utilized Bitcoin as a global settlement network. - Will Clemente

The Lindy effect
- “proposes the longer a period something has survived to exist or be used in the present, it is also likely to have a longer remaining life expectancy. Longevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence or competition, and greater odds of continued existence into the future.”
- Consider the amount of challenges bitcoin has faced throughout its years including countries banning it, fud over energy use, collapse of major players like Luna and FTX, thousands of altcoins that are trying to compete including 2 failed forks. And yet Bitcoin not only continues to survive, but thrive. It has never been hacked, centralized exchanges have been, but not the bitcoin network itself.

Immaculate conception - Satoshi (unknown identity) left the project very early on 
- unique historical “accident” that would be very difficult to recreate
- Any attempt the recreate bitcoin would probably be centralized and would have incentive problems that surround pre-mines and centralized dev teams
- Bitcoin was able to grow under the radar before cryptocurrencies were widely recognized by the public and by regulators. It had zero value for the first few years (unlike pre-mined hyped altcoins
- Any similar solution will never be able to catch up to Bitcoin’s first mover advantage
- We see this with BSV and BSH, two failed forks of BTC that have much smaller market caps and have depreciated against BTC since they were created. Forking BTC will not work again.
- The conditions needed to create and sustain bitcoin were very special. 
- First principles, was created due to the distrust in the currency and in banks. Currency is becoming devalued and banks can freeze your accounts.

Balance of Speed, Security and Decentralization
- Visa is fast but not decentralized. It is also not permission-less or censor-resistant. Visa does not offer final settlement but relies on US banking rails.
- Wells Fargo is secure, but not decentralized, permission-less or censor-resistant. Bank accounts can be frozen.
- Ethereum is not decentralized. 70% of it was pre-mined, controlled by inner circle of people surrounding Joe Lubin and Vitalik Buterin, who get to determine it’s future monetary policy. 
- Proof of stake networks use less energy but are much less secure.
- Bitcoin is extremely fast for a system that offers final settlement.
- Only Bitcoin solves for the best trade offs between speed, security, and decentralization. The base layer provides security, while layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network bring speed and more privacy.
- You want your medium of exchange to be secured by highest hash rate, highest security, and highest resistance to being debased

Fixed amount
    - Bitcoin’s production process (called “mining”) limits the production of coins to 21 million over a period of approximately 150 years. Since the upper limit of bitcoins is fixed, over time bitcoins should become more valuable relative to other currencies as the supply of government-backed fiat currencies continue to increase. Its certain limited supply is a unique feature that stands in opposition to nearly every other traditional currency.

Use cases
- There are parts of the world that are facing double digit inflation with restrictive government regimes. Bitcoin presents a real use case above and beyond mere speculation that will persist for quite a while.
- Currently the best settlement tool for cross border transactions
- It is available to all without the need for an intermediary 
- Millions of unbanked individuals in Africa for whom Bitcoin has been the most accessible option for participating in the world economy. 
- Politically neutral alternative to what will undoubtedly be a bipolar intensely political choice between the US dollar and the Chinese Yuan. 
- Enables human rights, cross-border payments, low cost remittances, self-sovereignty, censorship resistance, and financial freedom for underbanked families across the world

Principles of sound money
- salability - the ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever it’s holder desires, with the least loss in its price. Salability across scales, across space, and across time.
- Store or value - for a good to be salable across time, it has to be immune to rot, corrosion, and other types of deterioration. For the good to maintain its value, it is necessary that the supply of the good not increase to drastically during the period which the holder owns it. The relative difficulty of producing new monetary units determines hardness of money, while easy money is money whose supply is amenable to large increases.
- Acceptability - the more people accept a monetary medium, the more liquid it is called and the more likely it is to be bought and sold without too much loss.
- Unit of account - having a single medium of exchange allows the size of the economy to grow as large as the number of people willing to use that medium of exchange. 
- Sound money is chosen freely on the market for its salability, because it holds its value across time, because it can transfer value effectively across space, and because it can be divided and grouped into small and larger scaler. It is money whole supply cannot be manipulated by a coercive authority that imposes its use on others. 
- It protects value across time, allows for trade to be based on a stable unit of measurement, facilitating ever-larger markets, free from government control and coercion, a unit of account is essential for all forms of economic calculation and planning and unsound money makes economic calculations unreliable and is the root cause of economic recessions and crises. Sound money is an essential requirement for individual freedom from despotism and repression, as the ability of a coercive state to create money can give it undue power over its subjects, power which by its very nature will attract the least worthy, and most immoral, to take its reins. 
- Sound money is a prime factor in there determining individual time preference, an enormously important and widely neglected aspect of individual decision making. Time preference to the ratio at which individuals value the present compared to the future.
- One of the key problems caused by a currency whose value is diminishing is that it negatively incentivized saving for the future. Only by increasing the return in the future will people consider delaying gratification. Sound money is money that gains in value slightly over time, meaning that holding onto it is likely to offer an increase in purchasing power. Unsound money, being controlled by central banks whose express mission is to keep inflation possible, will offer little incentive for holders to keep it, as they become more likely to spend it or to borrow it. 
- Sound money creates an economic environment  where any positive rate of return will be favorable to the investor, as the monetary unit is likely to hold onto its value, if not appreciate. With unsound money, on the other hand, only returns that are higher than the rate of depreciation of the currency will be positive in real terms, creating incentives for high/return investment and spending. Further, it’s increases in the money supply effectively mean low interest rates, the incentive to save and invest is diminished while the incentive to borrow increases. 

3 roles of money
- store of value, unit of account, medium of exchange

Store of value
- until Bitcoin’s invention, all forms of money were unlimited in their quantity and thus imperfect in their ability to store value across time. Bitcoin’s immutable monetary supply makes it the best medium to store the value produced from the limited human time, thus making arguable the best store of value humanity has ever invented. To put it differently, Bitcoin is the cheapest way to buy the future, because Bitcoin is the only medium guaranteed to not be debased, no matter how much it’s value rises
- Bitcoin, by not having any physical presence, and being purely digital, is able to achieve strict scarcity. No divisible and transports or physical material ever achieved this before. Bitcoin allows humans to transport value digitally without any dependence on the physical world, which allows large transfers of sums across the world to be completed in minutes. The strict scarcity of the Bitcoin tokens combines the best elements of physical monetary media, without any of the physical drawbacks to moving and transporting it. 
Individual sovereignty
- bitcoin holders can send large amounts of value across the planet without having to ask for permission from anyone
- It can never be completely impeded, destroyed, or confiscated by any of the physical forces of the political or criminal worlds.

I went all in on btc in January 2020 (initially enough to buy a medium sized apartment at the time) and have bought consistently since. Since then, I have DCAd more into it, progressively increased my income in fiat terms, but kept my lifestyle relatively the same. Always been a frugal person. I still buy, DCA every hour of every day these days and practically never sold any substantial amount. I have enough, looking at today's fiat value, to last me several lifetimes, spending more than my salary these days, and my savings rate is high, so don't even spend it all.

Even using a conservative FIRE withdrawal rate of 4% (which comes from a conventional 60/40 portfolio of course, so lower returns than btc, but also less volatility), it's plenty and actually more than I earn. I'm going part time at work in a few months, so will DCA less in the future, but I'm hesitant about spending. It always feels like I need more sats.

So far I've been picking a savings amount every month based on expected expenses, leaving enough margin for extra spending, and then when the salary comes, I send the money I don't need straight to the exchange to fuel the DCA.

In the future I'll probably switch to just spending the salary and if there's any left at the end of the month, I'll send that to the exchange. 

How do I deal with this? Are there FIRE calculators out there that take the high volatility into account? How do you switch the mindset from saving to spending?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

And somebody generates this address: 

* 1BZJC6khXhpUToNFHMZvv1WTS4yQQqEjWkh 

They send you dust, hoping you'll accidentally copy their address the next time you want to receive coins... thus having Bitcoin sent to them, instead of yourself. It seems like a ridiculous attempt to steal coins, but it must work every now and then, otherwise the scammers wouldn't do it. 

Someone deposited to my address for the second time (first attempt it never confirmed) 330 sats on 16 January, which has confirmed.

1) Would you include this UTXO when consolidating? Should I be paranoid?

Reddit,bitcoin,A fair value framework of bitcoin based on it's relative monetary value versus gold,2025-02-01 17:22:52,"While some may disagree - I tend to subscribe to the notion that BTC is effectively digital gold. Gold has finite supply (albeit with some unknowns about what that precise total of accessible supply actually is) much like bitcoin. For much of human history gold has been viewed the ""gold standard"" for an appropriate exchange of value in society (e.g., widely accepted universal ""currency"").

One major difference between gold and bitcoin however is that a portion of gold's price can be attributed to it's real-world utility (industrial and ornamental uses) with another portion of its price attributed to its pure monetary/currency value. Contrast this versus BTC, which for all intents and purposes, I assume all of its price is attributed to its monetary value.

With all that being said, I think an interesting framework to identify the fair value price of bitcoin is the following:

1.) Observe the total supply of gold (mined and unmined)

2.) Observe the current price of gold versus the US dollar

3.) Determine the total market cap of gold on earth (current price per ounce \* total ounces of supply)

4.) Estimate the portion of gold's price attributed solely to its monetary value (i.e., excluding the portion attributed to industrial/ornamental use value)

5.) Calculate the market cap of gold supply adjusted for solely its monetary value (total market cap \* (1- %attributed to industrial/ornamental value)

6.) Divide the total adjusted market cap of gold by the total maximum amount of BTC that will ever be available (e.g., 21mm)... This will give you a fair value estimate for the price of bitcoin.

I ask ChatGPT to run this for me. Below are the results. As of today, this frame work yields a fair value estimate for BTC around $500k. The difference between today's $100k value of BTC and $500k is largely explained by the difference in buy-in/adoption of the bitcoin versus gold. As BTC adoption grows I would expect a narrowing/convergence of BTC toward the gold-based fair value estimate.

From ChatGPT:

To estimate Bitcoin’s fair value based on the **monetary** portion of gold’s value while considering both **above-ground and unmined gold reserves**, we follow these steps:

# 1. Total Gold Supply (Above-Ground + Unmined Reserves)

* **Above-Ground Gold:** \~212,582 metric tonnes ([gold.org](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/how-much-gold))
* **Unmined Gold Reserves:** \~53,000 metric tonnes ([USGS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-gold.pdf))
* **Total Gold Supply:** 212,582+53,000=265,582 metric tonnes212,582 + 53,000 = 265,582 \\text{ metric tonnes}
* **Convert to Troy Ounces:** 265,582×32,150.7=8,532,644,582 troy ounces265,582 \\times 32,150.7 = 8,532,644,582 \\text{ troy ounces}

# 2. Total Market Value of Gold

* **Gold Price per Ounce (Feb 1, 2025):** $2,799.20
* **Total Market Value of Gold:** 8,532,644,582×2,799.20=$23.88 trillion8,532,644,582 \\times 2,799.20 = \\$23.88 \\text{ trillion}

# 3. Portion of Gold’s Value Attributed to Monetary Use

* **Jewelry Demand:** \~48.7%
* **Industrial/Technology Demand:** \~6.7%
* **Monetary Use (Investment & Central Banks):** 100%−(48.7%+6.7%)=44.6%100\\% - (48.7\\% + 6.7\\%) = 44.6\\%
* **Monetary Value of Gold:** 23.88×44.6%=$10.65 trillion23.88 \\times 44.6\\% = \\$10.65 \\text{ trillion}

# 4. Implied Fair Value of Bitcoin

* **Total Bitcoin Supply (Max Cap):** 21 million BTC
* **Implied BTC Price:** $10.65 trillion21 million BTC=$507,143 per BTC\\frac{\\$10.65 \\text{ trillion}}{21 \\text{ million BTC}} = \\$507,143 \\text{ per BTC}

# Conclusion

* **Implied Bitcoin Price (Based on Gold’s Monetary Value Including Unmined Gold):** **$507,143 per BTC**
* **Current Bitcoin Price (Feb 1, 2025):** \~$101,904
* **Bitcoin’s Market Value Compared to Gold’s Monetary Value:** **BTC is undervalued by \~5x under this model**.

This estimate provides a **realistic upper bound** for Bitcoin’s valuation if it were to completely replace gold's monetary function.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

But like any intelligent person, I also want to grasp the downside, the bearish viewpoint, the skeptic's take, even if I ultimately take the bullish path. My takeaways from a lot of recent consumption of extremely breathless content are, generally --

1. Institutions and governments are cluing in and buying
2. \#1 plus the new ETFs will drive unprecedented new demand for Bitcoin specifically
3. Bitcoin is scarce and finite
4. Bitcoin has had an incredible run, but we're in fact still very early in its lifetime
5. All these factors combine to mean Bitcoin will be worth (in USD terms) multiple $millions, maybe in a very short period of time, making today's \~$100k/Bitcoin look quaint much like the 4-figure Bitcoin now looks quaint.
6. It is the only asset class capable of providing returns that are meaningful in a life-changing way
7. Even ""non-crypto people"" should allocate some portion of their investment portfolio to Bitcoin

I don't need a dissertation in response, but would be most appreciative to hear a level-headed take that is bullish (believes everything listed above), but can still objectively assess the opposite case without prejudice. Thanks!

After some research and quite a bit of testing, my conclusion is that you really have to zero any drives that have ever touched your wallet if it is ever going to leave your custody.  A format is not enough, and a secure delete for that wallet instance isn't either, if the wallet was ever copied or written anywhere else on the drive.  A wallet file is a digital file that can be copied and duplicated over and over again.  This means there's even copies on backups.  You're probably safe, for now, if it is password protected or encrypted.

Reddit,bitcoin,PSA: Bitcoin Mempool is low – Clean Up Your UTXOs,2025-01-31 15:33:17,"Felt like creating a small PSA! The mempool’s basically a desert right now. Fees are stupid low, and if you’ve been stacking for a while, this is your chance to consolidate UTXOs.

**Why, what?**

* Every time you receive Bitcoin, you create a UTXO ( like a “chunk” of BTC in your wallet). If you’ve DCA’d for months, swapped on Lightning, you probably have dozens of tiny UTXOs.
* More UTXOs = bigger, pricier transactions later. Each UTXO needs a separate transaction (sort of)
* Right now, consolidating (combining UTXOs) costs pennies. Later? Not so much.

**How to Clean Up Your UTXOs**  
*You’ll need a wallet with “coin control” – Electrum, Sparrow, BlueWallet, or most hardware wallets (Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard).*

1. **Check Your UTXOs** Open your wallet, find the coin control/UTXO section. Look for clusters of small UTXOs (like 0.0005 BTC or less).
2. **Pick the Ones to Merge** Select 10-20 of those tiny UTXOs. Don’t grab everything – leave a few for flexibility.
3. **Send Them to Yourself** Create a new receive address in your wallet. Send all the selected UTXOs to that address in one transaction. Set the fee to 2-3 sat/vB (it’ll confirm fast right now, you might need to increase this later).
4. **Repeat If Needed** Do this in batches if you’ve got hundreds of UTXOs. No rush – just get it done while fees are low.

This isn’t urgent. Take your time, double-check addresses, test with small amounts first.

**Final Note**  
The mempool won’t stay empty forever. Bull runs always bring congestion, and fees *will* pump again. Spend 10 minutes today to save yourself rage and wasted cash later. It felt like a good exercise to break out my old ledger again today.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,bitcoin,Suggestions for lumpsum vs dca,2025-02-01 18:02:11,"I'm 30+, have been buying Bitcoin occasionally over the years, accumulating a modest amount—not life-changing. With a better job now, I’m considering selling a significant portion of my stocks to go all in on Bitcoin. The total investment will still be less than one BTC, but I see better long-term potential (10+ years).

For those with experience or some insights:

1. Should I invest lump sum or split 50/50 between lump sum and DCA?

2. If DCA, should I spread it over 12 months or a shorter period?

I know this is not a financial advisor forum but I want to know from those who would have done this previously.. I'm a bit nervous given the current bull run. What’s the optimal strategy?

Reddit,bitcoin,Looking for Beta Testers for BTC Notify App,2025-02-01 10:43:08,"Hi fellow bitcoiners!

I was to enslaved checking the bitcoin price chart all day, so I solved my own problem by building a simple android app which notifies me when the price crosses a certain price point. E.g. every 1000 in-/decrease. When the price stays in the same range I just don't get any notifications, which is really relaxing haha.

This is a free and open-source app, and to make it easy for others to install I wanted to publish it to the Play Store. The problem is that I tried multiple times with 12 testers to get it through but Google wants me to test it more. (Probably not enough usage since you just get notifications and that's it.)

I would really appreciate if you guys would join the Google test group, try the app, and leave some feedback! Here is how to join:

1. Join the Google group: [https://groups.google.com/g/btc-notify-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/btc-notify-testers)
2. Become a tester and install the app: [https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.bitcoin.btcnotify](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.bitcoin.btcnotify)

One thing I’ve read is how we left the gold standard because of how difficult it is to pay debts with a deflationary currency. My understanding is that in concept BTC would present this same issue, and even with its fractional nature, this could still be an issue. 

What are the arguments about how BTC will address debt crises? And is using a fiat currency alongside BTC as the hard standard the way of the future?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Monthly Optimists Discussion - February 2025,2025-02-01 10:04:29,"Welcome to the Monthly Optimists Discussion thread. As the title implies, the purpose of this thread is to promote discussion which is guardedly optimistic about cryptocurrency topics. This thread is intended to be a counterweight to the Skeptics Discussion thread and will be pinned when the markets are bearish.

Please read the rules and guidelines before participating.

&nbsp;

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence. For example, announcing an obscure online store is adopting coin X for payments and then speculate Amazon will adopt it next without evidence. Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Tarrifs resulting in BTC bump?,2025-02-01 22:48:09,"So, I'm pretty sure Monday's tarrifs are just the beginning of a major stock market reset (at best) and, after 20yrs of savings, on Friday I liquidated almost all my stock.  I called a couple people I generally invest with to tell them I wasn't going to be coming to meetings for the foreseeable future and was surprised to hear that they'd both done the same.  

All of us were basically discussing where to invest now.  We can't be alone here. I'm thinking a bunch of that money leaving the stock market is going to be put into BTC.

That's question one.

Next: I used to work for an export company that worked with eastern Europe and Russia.  When tarrifs were imposed (on their side) we'd use outside bank transfers to bypass them.  (I was a young intern working computers and thought this was totally legit).  Anyway, now we are the one imposing tarrifs and people are going to be doing lots of work-arounds.  Crypto is, by far, the easiest method to set up internationally.

So, the combination of people getting out of the market because they think it will collapse, plus people using crypto to bypass tarrifs....  Will that increase BTC?  Or am I just trying to convince myself it's a good idea?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why would you want a Federal crypto reserve? (other than short term gains),2025-02-01 14:29:13,"Cryptocurrency skeptic here (Hear me out).

 When I first heard about the plan for a Bitcoin federal reserve I had a lot of feelings, but one thought keeps coming back : Who cashes out first?

The plan as I know it is that the Fed buys 1 million bitcoin (5% of the current bitcoin circulation, value at posting of $100 billion USD) over 20 years (est $5 billion/year). Justifications include funding federal programs with the ""revenue"". But the only way to get money from cypto is to sell it. So when the Fed even whispers about selling the reserve, wouldn't the price crash? 

The top Bitcoin investors (who helped get the current president elected) have definitely thought about this scenario, so they definitely have a plan for capitalizing on their investment. The top 20 crypto holder control more than 19% of the bitcoin supply (not accounting for Nakamoto's estimated 5%), so this small group of finance professionals have significant control over bitcoin supply and demand. And the Fed must know that the investors know. 

Looks like we have a Mexican standoff. Whoever sells screws over everyone who owns a bitcoin. If investors decide to sell, the US taxpayer is left $100 billion in the hole. If the president (this one or the next) or the senate becomes crypto bearish and decides to sell, the investors lose a lot of value.

The only reason I can see the Fed going through with this is to setup a legal framework that keeps the investors from screwing them over. Which the investors would hate as the whole point of cryptocurrencies was that no single entity (nation-state or otherwise) would have complete control over the circulation.

This isn't even considering the possibility of a fork or other rug-pull that would prevent the Fed from selling.

Does any of this seem plausible? I'm certainly no expert in finance or cryptocurrency so if anyone has a plausible reason why this Mexican standoff would not happen, I'll listen.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What's the reason crypto community members tend to worship certain indivudals?,2025-02-01 10:29:31,"I've always found this one a bit strange, when you consider the nature of crypto.

Most crypto holders can agree on decentralisation, power to the people, F the banks and some even argue for lack of regulation in spite of scams.

So isn't it ironic that when you look at many of the top coins, many of those 'communities' tend to idolise 1 or even 2 people? Not to even go looking into shitcoins where the fantasy can get even worse sometimes (Look at HEX worshipping their number 1 scammer Richard Heart like a God, it's bizarre).

I'm going to list a few top examples, and if this touches a nerve with you well maybe you're in my example:

\- Cardano community members idolising Charles Hoskinson

\- Dogecoin and Elon Musk

\- Eth and Vitalik

\- AlgoNauts jumping to the defence of their Foundation every single time someone questions the dumping

\- In the past, Luna (""Lunatics community) and Do Kwon

\- Heck, even head over to Bitcoin sub and you will see not 1 but 2 individuals being worshipped, Saylor gets more mentions than Satoshi these days and weirdly gets praised for being a genius all the time (because he buys BTC and shills it? lol)

I know what some of y'all might probably reply, ""Of course the creator gets worshipped!"". But to me it's very weird to see an entire community of grown men worship another dude as if he's a celebrity, in a space where everyone raves about decentralisation but once you see something gets small criticism an army of these supporters come to the rescue of their hero or rich billionaire.

They are discussing this like it's a side hustle; just make a couple a week and sell on the way up, what is a meme, and which ideas could work. They are discussing websites and past dumps/rugs. They even talked about irl friends they would get into projects with and discord/telegram friends who could help them with this, along with their different wallets they set up to try and pull this.  

Obviously, I know this happens and anyone who's in their first week would realize this. Last cycle, the indicator we hit top was when normies were talking about crypto in public, do you think we're there? Or is the hustle of memetokens finishing up?

I recently just noticed the news of Kraken delisting USDT to comply with new European Regulations, MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets). I won't go into great detail on why and how they're trying to get rid of US pegged stablecoins, but Kraken announced that by the end of March USDT will be shelved.

I just can't seem to find more info about other exchanges like Bybit, because I have investments and plan to make even more investments in Bybit, I also love bots and copytrading on Bybit, which all require USDT - so that means those plans are dead?

EDIT: Also, here's what else I've found:
*The MiCA framework does not apply to the European Central Bank, EU national banks.*

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Buying alt coins that have vanished,2025-01-31 22:59:37,"Hi accountants, we can get tax deductions on our loses. After making profits in this cycle I want to sell or offset my loses by selling coins that went to zero in 2017. Literally $2000 down to $0.

But we can't sell, we have the coins in the wallet but coin has rugged and disappeared from this planet.

This coin has disappeared so how can we get a tax deduction with it? including the exchange saying you can't sell your tokens try transfering to another wallet. If I transfer to another wallet that doesn't do anything as coins are no longer in existence. The project is deleted.

Can we burn the coin or put in a fake address that goes to thin air in this case we can have a so called sell invoice to claim on tax?

Or is a screenshot of the value good enough for tax? Baught $2000 in 2017 - current wallet value $0 in 2025.

Thanks in advance.
....….......
(Offset my 2017 losses for this years profits to benifit tax.)

Edit: thanks for your comments.

I've emailed the exchange and they emailed me a receipt with 33cents lol, and removed the coins from my account with no fees. It's a win, it was worth zero on my side. Easy tax deduction on the zillion I made and will make this cycle. A few years ago they weren't this helpful which I was surprised they did it so easily this time, literally not even 15 minutes.

 Also shows how easily keeping coins on the exchange can be gone in a few minutes with their backend stuff.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

I received over 250 billion coins worth over $47,000. I panicked for second, thinking I accidentally bought more than I wanted and check the blockchain transaction. No, I really spent like $40 something dollars and my coinbase wallet was showing me $47,000 of coins. 

Problem is I’ve tried transferring to a stable coin to cash out, I’ve tried swapping it for another coin, bridging it to another network. Every time I try to move it, the value reverts back to what it would’ve been if I had bought $50. I’ve even tried to send $500 of these coins to a friend and it shows up in their wallet as a fraction ($0.11) of the coins my wallet is showing me I sent. 

I had an extra $14 worth of Polygon hanging out in my wallet so I bought more XEN. It added another $12,000 to my wallet.

I’m on Coinbase and Kraken but don’t quite understand how to use either pro app, tbh.

Anyway, this is what I’ve been doing.  I have a few that I’m holding xrp, ena, hbar, doge (I know..).  However, I’ve been trying to apply an anti fomo; when one is going up I either buy something new and cheap or something trending down.  Occasionally, I try and catch an upward wave.

What else should I be doing and who should I be studying from?  I feel like many of YouTuber are more like psychics than they are number runners.  I won’t lie, I’d like to make out like a bandit.  But, if I can diversify, have a few leftover in wallet, and come clean with my initial investment, I’d be happy.

Is there a way I can check the public address to see what's on there? The problem is I have no idea what block chain it's on. Or could I try a few hot wallets with the 12 word seed and see if any of them can 'connect'. I've kind of forgotten how all this stuff works so maybe that's not the right way to go about it.

The $20 million investment not only shows VC confidence in the future of Elastos but will help to drive the advancement of Elastos technologies and enhance marketing efforts.

Elastos has been merge-mined with Bitcoin since 2018 and currently has over 50% of Bitcoin's hashrate. It boasts a large ecosystem across multiple side-chains.

Any advice on the best way to handle this? I put my data into koinly and cointracker and they each calculated completely different capital gains. I’m feeling a bit concerned since I’d like to get it right but it seems every website I try gives different results.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Satoshi’s Grand Illusion: How Crypto Tricked the World,2025-02-01 12:20:27,"Imagine it's 2009. Bitcoin has just been launched, and Satoshi Nakamoto, its creator, offers you 10,000 tokens in exchange for your car. Naturally, you want to assess whether these tokens are worth your car, so you ask:

""What can they do?""

Nakamoto explains: ""They're digital items, intangible. They can't do what tangible items can.""

You counter: ""Sure, but we already have digital items like audio, movies, and books. Software is digital too. And these items do things, like providing music, visual experiences, conveying stories or knowledge, or performing tasks like text editing.""

Nakamoto replies: ""My coins don’t do any of that, but they can be used as currency. They can be traded for goods and services and facilitate transactions.""

You respond: ""I understand that. This is what we are trying to do right now - trade them. But first, I need to know if that trade is good for me. I need to know their use beyond trade.""

Nakamoto adds: ""They can store value.""

You're still not convinced. ""But that’s circular logic. It assumes that if I trade them now, I’ll be able to sell them for the equivalent value of my car. That tells me nothing about the worth of your coins.""

Nakamoto, now looking nervous, says, ""Okay, okay, but these coins are scarce. I won’t issue more than 21 million of them.""

You push back: ""Again, circular reasoning. It assumes that people need them and that there aren't enough of them to fulfill people's needs. But why would people need them in the first place? That’s what I’m asking. What needs do your tokens fulfill that other digital items cannot?""

Nakamoto grows anxious: ""Did you know that 97% of dollars today exist only as digital entries, just like my coins? Yet, you accept dollars every day without asking these questions.""

You reply: ""Yes, but I know that banks that issue them redeem them. They put dollars into circulation through loans or government bonds, and they withdraw them to redeem that debt, together with the collateral securing it. $10,000 can save my neighbor's car from foreclosure. In this way, I know exactly what $10,000 is worth. Do you issue your tokens as collateralized debt and then withdraw them to redeem that debt?""

Nakamoto shakes his head. ""No, I don’t. But my tokens are decentralized and securely stored in distributed databases. If you trade with me now, neither governments nor anyone else can take them from you.""

You challenge: ""But you're still assuming they have value without showing why. I could store my birthdate securely in a decentralized system, but that doesn’t make it valuable. No. People protect things because they’re valuable in the first place, because they satisfy needs, or are productive like stocks and bonds, or hold crucial information like financial records. So tell me: What makes your tokens valuable in the first place? Why would protecting them be necessary?""

Nakamoto answers: ""Because they’re portable, durable, divisible, and fungible.""

You respond: ""But those are just generic features that apply to many digital items, like virtual goods in games. The value of those goods comes from how they enhance gameplay. In other words, they're valuable because they do something. So, what do your tokens do that makes them valuable?""

Nakamoto shifts uneasily. ""They’re digital money, and they’re designed to be used in transactions.""

You push harder: ""But that’s just the management of tokens. You’re trying to convince me these tokens are worth my car, yet all we’re talking about is moving them around. Tell me about the tokens themselves.""

Nakamoto stammers: ""But you don’t need any third party to facilitate transactions. It’s the future of money.""

You respond, frustration building: ""It doesn’t matter how secure or decentralized they are if the tokens themselves do nothing - just like strings of random numbers.""

Nakamoto’s face tightens, and he struggles to come up with another point.

You continue: ""So you’re just asking me to trade a digital item that does nothing for something of real value, my car. And all you’ve offered are talking points about controlling and managing that illusion. That’s not value. That’s just the mechanics of trying to get something for nothing. Conversation ends.

And yet, the world fell for the illusion. People began pouring real money into digital tokens that had no utility, buying into the hype, not because the tokens had value, but because they blindly believed they did. From an initial price of $0.001 to over $100,000, every price point was just blind speculation, a cascade of belief without function. Nakamoto’s white paper, wrapped in technical jargon and revolutionary rhetoric, was just a well-crafted sales pitch. And in the greatest trick ever played, people didn’t just accept it, they convinced themselves that owning digital nothingness made them part of the future.

Bitcoin was only the beginning. The same illusion that made people believe in its value spread to an entire industry - cryptocurrency. Thousands of digital tokens emerged, each promising revolutionary change, yet none offering anything fundamentally different. The conversation never changed; the promises of decentralization, security, and scarcity replaced actual function, and speculative trading replaced real utility.

Altcoins, stablecoins, DeFi projects, and NFTs followed, all wrapped in complex jargon but fundamentally built on the same foundation: belief without substance. Crypto evangelists preached financial freedom while insiders cashed out. Institutions, fearing they were missing the next big thing, fueled the hype. And all the while, the question remained unanswered: What do these tokens actually do?

The answer? Nothing, except exist as objects of speculation, moving from one hand to another in a never-ending game of greater fool theory. Satoshi Nakamoto’s trick wasn’t just convincing people that Bitcoin had value. It was laying the foundation for an entire system where belief alone could create trillion-dollar markets. Crypto didn't just trick the world - it turned illusion into industry.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Ability to Delay Transactions and Call Them Back?,2025-01-31 20:33:47,"Hi everyone,

An Idea

With crypto becoming more and more mainstream. it got me thinking if there was a way to implement to delay a transaction and call it back? My thinking is if you start a transaction on Solana or ETH. You can select a delay period of your choice so 1 hour or even up to 24 hours. In this period the the transaction can be put on hold and also ""Semi-confirmed"" (Confirmed but waiting for the delay period) The crypto will be put on hold in neither your wallet or the recipients wallet. There will be a receipt in each wallet so you can confirm your funds will make it to the recipients wallet. In this period if you change your mind you can call the transaction back.

Why would you want this?

I've been in crypto for over 10 years. I see new people entering the market all the time. One thing I see all the time is people sending crypto to the wrong address or sending an unsupported crypto. With this approach you could confirm your funds will make it. Also you could call back the transaction if you realise you made a mistake. You could also set limits so anything over $1000 will always have a hold period of 1 hour or so! I think something like this could be a game changer for new people and folks with large amounts of funds!

Example

You could send the transaction with 1 hour conformation. You get a receipt and the merchant gets a receipt into there wallet. In your wallet you could have outgoing and incoming receipts for example. Your wallet confirms that the receipt has successfully landed in the merchants address. You can verify it on there website or on the block chain. This is known as ""Semi Verified"" you can either then wait 1 hour or push the transaction through.

What do you guys think?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Black Rock is positioning to control Crypto cycles,2025-02-01 02:26:06,"So Black rock, the multi trillion dollar entity that has it's fingers in all the stock market pies, has been buying up Bitcoin at an ever increasing rate.

Now it has ETF's and growing investors to fuel the buying, alongside a very disturbing amount of Bitcoin.

Black rock now owns 6% of all Bitcoin via it's ETF's.

This means it can create liquidation cycles just by selling Bitcoin.

It can position itself into alt coins that follow Bitcoins movements, and simply short them with precision timing, dropping the price of Bitcoin and then buying up those alt coin at cheaper prices.

Then it can buy Bitcoin again, enter the alt coins and grow those positions, eventually owning enough of a percentage, that it can drop the price of Bitcoin again and sell those alt coin positions off while simultaneously shorting them.

Rinse and repeat for control via ownership.

Black rock is setting up to completely take over Crypto.

And If crypto just essentially becomes the private banking institution for Black Rock, does it even matter if it's decentralized anymore?

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

The private key is any 256-bit number in [0, N] where N is the order of the curve. So if I have a random 64-byte stream, the probability of it being a valid EC public key on the curve is `N / 2^512 = 2^256 / 2^512 = 2^{-256}`. Does this sound right?

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"". So then how would I find the probabilty of a random 32-byte stream being a valid EC public key on the (secp256k1) curve? Does the probability remain the same?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Then the patient uses his/her private key to sign the data, and then the hospital encrypts it (page 5):

So I'm guessing (pk0, pk1) is probably from Ed25519 but (ak0, ak1) may be from X25519. The patient data is then encrypted using ak0, but isn't that something you aren't supposed to do? The paper doesn't mention the size constraints on patient data either.

It then says that:

>The newly generated data has to be validated before they can be added to the blockchain. These data are validated by the admin (doctor, pathologists, radiologists) following the process depicted in figure 5 using the admin private key ak1.

  
But figure 5 doesn't mention ak1:

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

I am wondering for any information on the security of SHA3 and its sponge function versus older hash functions like MD5, SHA1, SHA2.

What makes it more secure? How heavily studied has it been. The sponge function is still newer than the other constructions but its internal state is quite large.

I am looking for hash functions with good security margins.

BLAKE2 and SHA3 are so far the best looking but is there any reason I should look at SHA2 again because it’s well studied.

I would like to engage in a thorough discussion comparing these hash functions.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2025-02-02 00:54:19.336196

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)
