Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $108K: Can Bulls Sustain Momentum Against Bearish Signals? Bitcoin Ready For $150,000 Price Target – Analyst In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username Percival has touted Bitcoin to achieve a $150,000 price in the current bull cycle. Commenting on the present market state which might be unsettling to certain investors, Percival states that Bitcoin’s price trajectory, marked by sharp upward spikes and periods of consolidation, resembles the structural dynamics of any mature financial asset. In regards to future price movement, the analyst references a Fibonacci expansion from Bitcoin’s cycle low at $15,450 in November 2022 to the consolidation at $48,934 in 2024. In translating this historical data to the current market, Percival identifies a Bitcoin price target between $136,000 – $150,000 which is further supported by data from Bitcoin Realized Price Bands – a market metric that analyses supply based on different buying levels. However, for Bitcoin to trade at $150,000, the asset must attain a total market cap of $3 trillion. Currently, there is strong historical data in support of this postulation. For context, Percival explains that Bitcoin Realized Cap rose by 470% in the previous bearish cycle in 2021. Presently, the realized Cap has only grown by 111% suggesting more potential for market growth. Furthermore, the analyst identifies possible sources of demand to drive up the projected  $3 trillion market expansion, one of which is the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Notably, these investment funds registered nearly $40 billion in inflow during their debut trading year in 2024.  With the US expected to adopt a pro-crypto stance in the Donald Trump administration, institutional demand is also likely to surge stronger through these ETFs. In addition, Percival includes the Bitcoin Futures market which is currently valued at $95 billion as another potential bullish driver for the projected market expansion Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Extends To 1.1 Million BTC As Profit-Taking Continues BTC Price Overview  At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at 102,334 reflecting a 1.66% decline over the last day.

Looking forward, the analysts at Coincodex predict Bitcoin could trade at $113, 658 and $132,823 in the next five and thirty days respectively.

If given the green light, this ETF would enable investors to acquire direct exposure to Polkadot without the need to purchase and maintain the cryptocurrency themselves. The 21Shares Polkadot Trust, a proposed fund, is intended to be listed on the CBOE BZX Exchange. Coinbase will be the custodian for DOT tokens. Related Reading: Trump Effect? Solana Stablecoin Supply Jumps 73% Since Mid-January A Step Towards Increasing The Number Of Crypto Investment Options This ETF aims to make it easier for both large buyers and everyday people to buy Polkadot. The blockchain is known for its interoperability, allowing different networks to communicate and share data. 21Shares ETF filing with the SEC. Source: US SEC. 21Shares is trying to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world by offering an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This will make DOT a more attractive choice for investors who like controlled investments instead of owning cryptocurrencies directly. This follows rising demand for diversified crypto-based ETFs. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have garnered attention, Polkadot’s participation shows popular interest in alternative currencies. However, the success of this filing depends on how the SEC views Polkadot’s regulatory standing, a factor that could impact the outcome of the approval process. Market Performance Presents Obstacles Polkadot has encountered market obstacles, despite the enthusiasm that fueled the filing. The price of DOT has decreased by approximately 5% in the past year, and it has declined by more than 10% in the past month alone. DOT is currently trading at approximately $6.42, a significant decline from its previous all-time highs. The ETF filing acknowledges that the asset can be unstable and warns buyers about possible risks. Polkadot’s value could still be uncertain, even with an ETF setup, and there’s no guarantee that the token will rise or bounce back soon.

The SEC’s stance on digital assets is evolving, thus Polkadot’s security status may make it challenging for 21Shares to develop an ETF.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is The Crypto Market ‘Satiated’ For Now? Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move,2025-02-01 06:30:10+00:00,"As the first month of 2025 comes to an end, Bitcoin (BTC) continues moving within its post-US election price range but nears two historical closing candles. Some analysts weighed in on the market’s state, suggesting that it could be satisfied with good news for the time being. Related Reading: SUI Rally Eyes Double-Digits: VanEck Analyst Forecasts $16 Price By Year-End Bitcoin Near Historical Monthly Candle Despite the recent corrections, Bitcoin has been moving inside the $90,000-$108,000 range since December 2024, consolidating within the mid-zone of its price range for most of this period. Some analysts have pointed out that the flagship crypto has had a decent performance this month, not staying away from the $100,000 mark for long. Moreover, its recent recovery of the $104,000-$105,000 range is setting the stage for a historical monthly and weekly candle. As noted by analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin is hours away from closing the month above the $100,000 barrier for the first time and “printing a new Monthly Candle to confirm a breakout from its Monthly Bull Flag.” Additionally, Bitcoin could see a “historic Weekly Close” if it ends the week above $104,416. According to the analyst, similar closes above major weekly resistances at this point of the cycle have historically preceded a “continued upside to new all-time highs.” Nonetheless, Rekt Capital has also pointed out that BTC is most likely preparing for the second leg of its Post-halving Parabolic Phase, which suggests that a new Price Discovery rally could start mid-February. The second leg has historically started around the 16th week of the Parabolic Phase, the analyst explained, while BTC is currently in the 14th week, recovering from the First Price Discovery Correction. Based on this timeline, the flagship crypto is expected to continue gearing up for the rally for another week and a half, and investors are advised to “patiently HODL” BTC. Is The Crypto Market’s Confidence Shaken? Another market watcher noted that Bitcoin has been “stuck in rage for a while now,” adding that he expected to see some bullish momentum after the FOMC news. The trader considers that the lack of significant price movement suggests BTC’s price will “be sideways for the coming few days.” Recently, Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at Nansen, weighed in on the market’s current state. Barthere suggested that the market appears to be “satiated for now,” as most of the recent bullish news has been seemingly overlooked. The report highlighted the latest regulatory changes, including the overturn of SAB 121 and the executive order for a US Crypto Stockpile, have been “extremely bullish” and will likely facilitate a wider crypto adoption. Additionally, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is reportedly considering public blockchain to track and manage public expenses. However, the news has been ignored and followed by “underwhelming price action by BTC and the rest of the crypto market.” This suggests that the market is momentarily satiated and “more reactive to negative sentiment than positive news.” Barthere pointed out how the DeepSeek-triggered pullback from Monday bled into the crypto market.

Based on the price and volume action right after the shakeout, the analyst noticed “that ‘buyers’ confidence has been somewhat shaken,” resulting in an initially timid recovery.

This 1.2% increase over the past hour reflects renewed optimism in the market. Amid this price performance, Crypto Dan, a CryptoQuant analyst has shared his analysis of on-chain data and market behaviors that may shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the weeks and months ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outflows Signal Bullish Strength As Demand Remains High At $100K – What This Means Bitcoin Bullish Market But Caution According to Dan, the amount of Bitcoin held for less than six months continues to show notable growth with each market cycle. This trend suggests that as Bitcoin’s appeal widens, new capital inflows—particularly from the expected introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs—could further drive demand. Dan anticipates that both institutional and retail investors will ramp up their involvement as these ETFs gain traction by the first half of 2025. Additionally, while current indicators remain bullish, Crypto Dan warns that surging interest in Bitcoin and altcoins, paired with an influx of new investors, could signal that the current cycle may be nearing its peak. If Bitcoin pushes through its all-time high with significant momentum, and altcoins follow suit, it could trigger a wave of inflows that may mark the cycle’s final stages. Dan advises investors to start considering risk management strategies.

According to recent Binance data, retail investors have significantly increased their BTC deposits over the past month, with inflows reaching approximately 6,000 BTC. In contrast, whale activity on Binance has dwindled, with their BTC inflows dropping to around 1,000 BTC—a fourfold decrease. Darkfost notes that retail investors often use exchanges to liquidate their holdings, whereas whales’ reduced inflows suggest they are holding onto their Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters Ascending Phase After Cup And Handle Formation At $105,000, Here’s The Next Target This contrasting behavior offers insights into broader market sentiment: retail participants appear eager to capitalize on short-term gains, while larger, more established investors maintain a more cautious stance.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Stablecoins See Positive Momentum: Will This Lead To New Bitcoin All-Time High?,2025-02-01 03:30:31+00:00,"Data shows the stablecoins USDT and USDC have been seeing capital inflows recently, something that could turn out to be bullish for Bitcoin. Top 2 Stablecoins Have Seen Their Market Caps Grow Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the market caps of the top two stablecoins: USDT and USDC. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the data for the 30-day change in the market caps of the two cryptocurrencies. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day percentage change in the market cap of USDC has spiked to sharp positive levels recently, implying that the stablecoin has been growing at a rapid rate. Unlike USDC, which has seen sustainable growth for the last few months, USDT kicked off the year 2025 with its 30-day market cap change dipping into the negative territory. Since bottoming at around -2% earlier in the month, though, momentum has returned for the asset as the indicator has just turned back green. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Extends To 1.1 Million BTC As Profit-Taking Continues This means that at present, both of the two stablecoin giants are enjoying an increase in their market caps. Historically, growth in these fiat-tied tokens is something that has been bullish for Bitcoin and other volatile cryptocurrencies. The reason behind this is the fact that investors who store their capital in the form of stablecoins generally plan to invest into the volatile side of the market eventually. When they buy BTC with their stables, its price naturally receives a positive effect. The most bullish scenario for the sector occurs when both Bitcoin and the stablecoins witness a rise in their market caps. Such a setup implies both sides of the market are getting net capital inflows. When only one rises while the other goes down, it means capital is merely seeing a rotation between the two. The recent inflows into USDT and USDC have come while BTC has been consolidating sideways. This suggests the capital entering into the stables is fresh, as BTC would have gone down if it was otherwise. At the same time, BTC itself isn’t seeing any direct inflows, hence the flat price action. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Forms Signal That Last Led To 40% Price Crash Usually, stablecoin holders deposit to centralized exchanges when they want to purchase the volatile cryptocurrencies. Thus, the number of stable deposits into these platforms can tell us about whether large-scaling buying of this type is happening or not. An analyst has shared the data for the metric in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the indicator is following a flat trajectory right now. An increase in it, like the one witnessed earlier, may provide fuel for a further rally for Bitcoin.

The token’s price jumped from $1.98 on January 30 to $2.37 at the time of writing. Kraken Reintroduces Staking Services In Select States On January 30, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announced the relaunch of its staking services for US clients in 37 states and two territories. The exchange also noted plans to expand these services to additional states as regulatory conditions allow. Related Reading: Lido Finance Cements DeFi Lead, Expands To Optimism: Is LDO Undervalued? For the uninitiated, Kraken facilitates staking by delegating users’ staked tokens to network validators, who are responsible for transaction validation and block production. These validators then return rewards – minus fees – to clients who have staked their tokens with them. Commenting, Mark Greenberg, Global Head of Consumer at Kraken said the launch of this staking product in the US is a positive development for the entire US crypto industry. Greenberg added: Kraken serves as a bridge so people can access the crypto space and participate in an increasingly broad range of related activities from an interface and platform that they’re familiar with. Onchain staking is a key component of how we fulfill this role and we believe the resumption of staking in the US today will play a significant role in the development and mass adoption of crypto. Following the announcement, LDO experienced a sharp spike in buying activity, propelling its price above the psychologically significant $2 level. At the time of writing, LDO boasts a total market cap of $2.1 billion, making it the 63rd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Lido Soars 20%, What Do The Analysts Say? LDO’s surge has caught the attention of crypto analysts, many of whom see further upside potential. Crypto analyst World of Crypto noted that LDO is breaking out of both a bullish pennant and a descending broadening wedge. A successful breakout could send the token to the $7–$8 range within a few weeks. Related Reading: Lido Finance (LDO) Is Down 18% In 7 Days, Time To Buy The Dip? Similarly, crypto analyst Daan Crypto pointed to $3 as a crucial resistance level for LDO to break. He attributed the token’s outperformance to investors positioning themselves ahead of the Ethereum staking narrative. They added: It’s just a matter of time before we’ll see the first ETH Spot ETF filing with staking included. That should kick off the ETH & staking narrative and should help boost the performance on these Liquid Staking Derivatives coins. As a token closely tied to Ethereum staking, LDO’s price trajectory remains heavily influenced by ETH’s performance. Fortunately for LDO holders, analysts remain optimistic about an upcoming Ethereum rally. Earlier this month, crypto analyst Mister Crypto remarked that ETH looks ‘bottomed out’, potentially getting ready for a strong rebound. At press time, LDO trades at $2.37, up 19.1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from X and TradingView.com",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

The cryptocurrency had shown signs of a potential breakout, but key indicators have come into focus as the market evaluates its next move. The latest insights from analysts have raised questions about whether Bitcoin’s market momentum can overcome the resistance level at $108,000, its previous all-time high. Related Reading: MVRV Ratio Reveals Bitcoin’s Market Position Amid Short-Term Selling Pressure Analyzing Bitcoin’s Market Indicators Amid the price performance from BTC, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC has provided insights on the challenges and possibilities ahead for Bitcoin. Shayan noted that despite Bitcoin’s recent price increases, the funding rates—a critical on-chain indicator—have started to decline. This bearish divergence suggests that demand in perpetual markets may be weakening, casting doubt on whether the current bullish momentum is sufficient to push Bitcoin above its all-time high. Particularly, one of the primary hurdles for Bitcoin’s price to surpass $108,000 is the lack of strong market enthusiasm, as reflected in the funding rates. According to Shayan, typically, rising funding rates indicate an increase in long positions and market optimism. However, the current decline in these rates signals that traders are hesitant to bet on further price increases. Shayan emphasized that without a significant boost in optimism and a greater influx of long positions, Bitcoin’s resistance at $108,000 could hold firm, potentially leading to a consolidation phase or even a temporary price rejection. The analyst wrote: For Bitcoin to decisively breach $108K, the funding rates must rise further, signaling an increase in optimism and a greater influx of long positions. Without this market-wide enthusiasm, the resistance at $108K could hold, leading to potential consolidation or a temporary rejection. Indication from Long-Term Holders Metric On the other hand, long-term holders—investors who have maintained their Bitcoin holdings for seven years or more—have shown no inclination to sell their assets. Another CryptoQuant analyst reporting this in a post on the QuickTake platform noted: Holders who have held bitcoin for seven years or more sold some of their holdings before the end of the previous bull market. Long-term bitcoin holders have not yet moved their holdings to exchanges. This behavior highlights a trend seen in previous market cycles: long-term holders often remain resilient through price fluctuations, providing a steady base of support for the cryptocurrency.

Solana has been a significant actor in the crypto space for a long time; however, the release of this memecoin has sparked new interest, propelling the network’s stablecoin ecosystem to new heights.

More stablecoins are now available thanks to the rise of money entering the market, therefore enhancing Solana’s significance as a key blockchain for distributed finance. Its debut attracted new investments to the network and increased activity on Solana’s decentralized markets. The increase in money flowing into the market has led to more stablecoins being available, boosting Solana’s role as an important blockchain for decentralized finance.

SOLANA STABLECOIN SUPPLY SKYROCKETS 73% -WHAT’S DRIVING IT? Solana just hit $11.1B in stablecoin supply, jumping 73% since mid-Jan. Big catalyst? Trump’s memecoin ($TRUMP) triggering insane capital inflows + record DEX trading. Now Solana’s the #3 blockchain for stablecoins,… pic.twitter.com/9WAow0sKFd — IBC Group Official (@ibcgroupio) January 31, 2025 USD Coin Dominates Solana Stablecoin Market USD Coin (USDC) continues to be the most prevalent stablecoin asset in Solana, accounting for an impressive 78% of the network’s total stablecoin supply. The token’s widespread adoption across decentralized applications (dApps) and Solana’s ongoing relationship with Circle are both distinct indications of USDC’s dominance. In contrast, USDT, representing merely 12% of the stablecoin supply on Solana, bags the second place. This dynamic illustrates the impact of USDC’s preeminence on Solana’s stablecoin market, notwithstanding the sporadic appearance of alternative currencies like USDt. Solana’s Recent User Growth In addition to having an effect on Solana’s stablecoin market, the excitement around the $TRUMP token has significantly increased the number of on-chain users. Hundreds of thousands of new users have joined the Solana network in an attempt to join the $TRUMP frenzy.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Explodes 7,240% With 1.1 Billion Tokens Burned In 24 Hours, What’s Driving It?",2025-01-31 21:30:41+00:00,"The Shiba Inu burn rate has experienced a dramatic surge, exploding by an astonishing 7,240% in just one day. This massive surge has led to the removal of over 1.1 billion tokens from circulation, effectively reducing the token’s significant supply. The latest sharp increase in SHIB burns have also caught the attention of the crypto market, bringing focus to the factors driving this substantial surge and its potential impact on the meme coin.  What’s Driving The Surge In Shiba Inu Burn Rate  Shibburn, a token burn tracker, has reported a massive 7,240.75% increase in Shiba Inu burn rate in the past 24 hours. Astonishingly, this substantial token burn led to the permanent removal of approximately 1,104,706,719 SHIB tokens from circulation.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees Major 600% Jump In Only 24 Hours, Will SHIB Price Follow Suit? Notably, the driving force behind this massive SHIB burn was identified to be a single wallet. This anonymous wallet address, ox6d0cf1f…, was responsible for more than 95% of this substantial Shiba Inu burn, sending approximately 1,000,148,675 SHIB tokens to a dead wallet.  Following this, another address initiated a 100,000,000 SHIB burn, contributing to a significant amount of the burn activity. These combined efforts from Shiba Inu enthusiasts and community members have significantly impacted the circulating supply of SHIB, increasing the possibilities of a price surge in the meme coin.  Typically, token burns are executed with the intention to increase scarcity and potentially drive up the value of a token over time. Since its inception in 2020, a total of 410.74 trillion SHIB tokens have been burnt from its initial supply of 999.98 trillion.  Currently, the total supply of this meme coin stands at 589.2 trillion, reflecting a 41% decrease from its original amount. This reduction occurred in less than 5 years, marking a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. If burn rate continues to skyrocket, it could cause further deflation of supply, potentially leading to goals of many Shiba Inu community members, which is to drive the value of the meme coin to over $1.  SHIB Price Dips Seen As Golden Opportunity Despite the increase in Shiba Inu’s burn rate, its price has remained unaffected, even declining by over $8.3% in the past week. The doggy-themed meme coin crashed from its previous high above $0.00002 to $0.0000186 as of writing.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target While Shiba Inu faces this bearish trend, a crypto analyst SHIB Bezos, has highlighted the significant buying opportunities investors could take advantage of during this time. The analyst suggests that at some point, Shiba Inu will become oversold, and sellers will eventually get “exhausted”, leading to a rise in the price of the meme coin. Ahead of this increase, SHIB Bezos urges investors to take advantage of dip opportunities to buy more SHIB tokens at a discount and HODL for a long term growth potential of about 5-10 years.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Get Ready: XRP Set To Skyrocket To $4.39, Says Trading Guru",2025-01-31 20:00:57+00:00,"Renowned technical analyst Peter Brandt stirred up the XRP community on January 30 by posting a daily price chart (XRP/USDT) suggesting a “bull flag” continuation pattern. Brandt, whose reputation in charting spans decades, highlighted $4.39541 as the upper price objective based on the current market structure. “Hey XRP_pill_poppers. To be clear: I could care less what XRP is going to do. If it goes up I want to be long. If it goes down I’ve never shorted it, but prefer to troll the poppers. No other way right now to define the chart other than a bull flag. Of course this could change,” Brandt remarked. XRP Bull Flag Formation From the analyst’s vantage point, XRP rallied sharply earlier in January, pushing above $2.6040 before topping near $3.2140. Once this peak formed, the market entered a brief pullback, creating a series of lower highs and lower lows—visualized by descending trendlines on Brandt’s chart. This consolidation resembles a textbook bull flag, a pattern typically interpreted as a pause in an ongoing uptrend. Brandt’s projected breakout could target the next prominent overhead region near $3.5487, with his ultimate bullish objective in the vicinity of $4.39541. These levels—shown by green lines on the chart—indicate possible resistance areas if XRP extends its rally upon confirming the flag’s upper boundary. Two moving averages are visible on Brandt’s chart: The 8-day moving average (green line) is currently hovering just above $3.00. It is helping to define short-term support levels. The 18-day moving average (orange line) is sloping upwards from below $2.70 and reinforces the broader uptrend in play. Meanwhile, the ADX reading of 17.05 suggests that the overall trend strength is moderate, leaving room for greater momentum if price breaks decisively from the flag. A 30-day Average True Range (ATR) value near 0.2135 underscores the daily volatility, which has risen compared to earlier phases but remains contained relative to some high-beta alternative coins. Brandt’s post sparked discussion among traders, including HTL-NL (@htltimor), who noted bullish confirmations using Wyckoff analysis. “Using Wyckoff, it looks good too. Of course, if $TC takes a dive, everything suffers, but it’s one of the better looking alt charts atm,” he stated. Brandt replied with approval, stating “Good confirmation from a good source.” According to the Wyckoff-based chart shared by HTL-NL, XRP has been tracing a series of classic phases—Beginning with the Automatic Rally (AR) after a Selling Climax (SC), followed by multiple Secondary Tests (ST), and culminating in what appears to be a Sign of Strength (SoS). The SoS label often marks the point at which demand decisively overcomes supply, with price pushing above a key resistance level and maintaining support above previously tested zones. This behavior is further supported by volume signatures that show interest resurging during rallies and diminishing on pullbacks. In Wyckoff terms, a successful SoS within a re-accumulation structure typically paves the way for continued upside. The blue line labeled “BUEC” (Back Up to Edge of the Creek) suggests XRP has already retested its last major resistance as support. Should it hold these levels and confirm the SoS, Wyckoff analysts would anticipate a drive toward higher targets, aligning with Brandt’s bullish flag projection. At press time, XRP traded at $3.09.

Reddit,solana,The Billionaires are meddling in  crypto and reaping retail investors quickly and slowly,2025-01-31 22:41:14,"
The crypto market today is a battlefield dominated by billionaires running coordinated cons against retail investors. From celebrity meme coins to the AI narrative, from Murad’s list of “approved” tokens to the Bitcoin ETF hype, everything is designed to extract liquidity from everyday traders and funnel it into the hands of the elite.
	•	Celebrity Coins: These are blatant cash grabs where influencers launch tokens, pump them through social media, and dump on their own followers. The result? Retail gets wrecked, while the celebrities and their insider teams walk away with millions.
	•	AI Narrative: Every major financial cycle has its golden gimmick, and AI is the latest. AI-powered crypto projects are being marketed as revolutionary, but most are just vaporware with no real-world adoption.
	•	Murad’s List: Hedge funds and institutions play a different game, quietly accumulating assets before making them “investable” for the masses. By the time a coin makes it onto these curated lists, the upside is already gone, and retail is left buying the top.
	•	Bitcoin ETF Manipulation: The ETF approval brought a wave of institutional money, but it’s clear that the game is rigged. Institutions use ETF flows to control Bitcoin’s price, squeezing out retail traders and extracting profits through market manipulation.

The Only Real Play Left: Finding a Quality CTO Project

With all this noise, retail investors are left searching for the few legitimate opportunities that billionaires haven’t yet flooded with their capital. The answer? Finding a strong Community Takeover (CTO) project before it enters the mainstream. A successful CTO means that a project is no longer in the hands of a corrupt dev or insider VC firms but is instead guided by its community.

i randomly came across this site that lets you buy random stuff with crypto and it made me realize how wild it is that we can do this now.

Reddit,solana,Screwing with millionaire rugpullers,2025-02-01 09:03:16,"I am not sure whether this is allowed here. I got the impression that rugpulling is considered unethical, while there is also not much sympathy for people being rugpulled, because they should know what they are doing. The problem is: The more money these rugpullers earn, the more they can screw with others. And they DO screw with others. They will accept losses of 100s of thousends of dollars, just to make sure that no one else profits. And that is how they are vulnerable. An investment of 5$ per coin can cost them 100s of thousands. Which may lead them to adapt their strategies, if it happens every time. 

  
Anyway, some basics:

If you invest 100$ and can reliable earn 10% per day, you will have 128.330.558.031.335.400$ at the end of the year. Just to remind people of exponential growth. If there is only single instance with 0% growth (no loss, though), the end result will be 116.664.143.664.850.350 €. Meaning one instance where you could screw with an investor one time would cost them 12 quadrillion dollars. 

Of course that is a fictional example that can not be realized. I am talking about a real world example, where the address Htft4xNX3ZBZnkcHzH8xhtFekhHY5FaGZjDERYpKanGE invests around 700,000$ into Barron/Ivanka tokens. They will usually get at least 50% gains every hour. This doesn'T include fees and other costs, of course. But there will likely still a substantial gain. 

Let's say that entity can gain 25% reliably for 10 times. The end result will be 65.192.580$. If they gain 0% for one single time, the end result will be 60.160.979$, about 5,000,000$ difference. And you can manage that with just a 5$ investment. 

How? They track investors and don't want anyone alse profiting with them. If you invest in their coins, then sell after gains of 20%, then invest again, they will identify your account and blacklist it. After that, even a 5$ investment from your account will cause them to rugpull early, costing them a lot of money.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,solana,Tools to identify common holders of multiple Solana tokens,2025-02-01 09:27:57,"Hello,

I'm trying to identify insider wallets of different Solana tokens. I am following a certain Twitter account that might be involved in insider trading of multiple memecoins. I want to identify his wallets or some of the wallets that were very early in those certain tokens.

So the data I have is just: tokens launched and the date of launch.

I need to crossreferrence all the holders of several memes (or other chain information) to see which ones are common. But Solscan only lets me download as CSV the first 1000 txn of holders. That's not enough. The volumes are highly manipulated and there are a lot of MEV bots. Could not find a way to sort holders by % of token held or by date of buy. 

Any tools that might get the job done. The bottlneck is the data export capped to 1000 txn. I'd manage to do the rest in Excel, altough an automated tool or sowftware would be great.

Thank you.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

I want to convert it into Solana to send to my Solana wallet. How can I do this?

For what it's worth, I ended up sending this to another metamask on a different device browser which also has my solana wallet.

Reddit,solana,I don't understand some people...,2025-01-31 23:09:36,"I currently have 2 test tokens on sol's mainnet to play around with for the game I am making. It's an ode to Space Quest.

Players will earn the coin like they would XP. 

Eventually, I will change the contract once the game fully launches and renounce it. But until then it's 10M supply with a LP of only about 600 for my needs.

Reddit,solana,Most DeFi AI agents are just LLMs making API calls - here's why that's a problem,2025-01-31 20:11:50,"Working on MEV/DeFi infra past 2 years. Current ""AI agents"" are cope - just LLMs making API calls without understanding chain dynamics. Literally zero onchain intelligence.

Core problem is data architecture. These agents:

* Can't parse historical pool dynamics
* Miss manipulation patterns in L2 sequencer data
* No temporal analysis of state changes
* Zero understanding of account behavior over time

Without proper indexed chain data (especially around account states and SVM history), agents are just fancy UI wrappers larping as AI. Need proper data orchestration layer between chain and agent.

Reddit,solana,What do you think of Kamino Multiply to earn up to 30% yield on SOL?,2025-01-31 21:49:56,"Kamino's Multiply on Solana is a looping leverage strategy. Basically you deposit SOL or an LST, like jitoSOL, for example. Multiply increases the jitoSOL position by borrowing SOL, swapping to jitoSOL and repeating several times. So if you start with say 100 SOL, you can effectively hold I guess maybe 180 SOL worth of staked SOL, so you end up earning maybe 15% to 30% yield on your SOL instead of just 12%.

Here is what they say about risk:

>A Multiply position can be liquidated **if the borrow interest rate is higher than the LST yield for a sustained period of time,** thus increasing your debt relative to the LST enough to reach the liquidation threshold.

>Liquidation can also occur if the LST platform's smart contract is exploited.

>LST depegs can no longer cause liquidations for Multiply positions.

So what are the chances of liquidation? This is the important question that I'm struggling with.

Looking at the chart provided on the mSOL Multiply page, I see 4 times in about a year where the APY for 5x leverage spiked negative for maybe a day, then quickly recovered. Would that cause liquidations? They say rates need to be negative for ""a sustained period of time"", but that could be hours, days, weeks, months?

What do you think of Mulitply and the risks?

Any idea how to guesstimate the chances of liquidation?

Reddit,solana,Ship or Die - Key Aspects Of Solana Foundation Technical Product Strategy For 2025,2025-01-31 18:44:49,"**Source:** [https://x.com/pkxro/status/1885058457327345740](https://x.com/pkxro/status/1885058457327345740)

>**Ship or Die**  
  
The worst thing a high-functioning but successful organization can do is become complacent, opaque and inundated with process  
  
In an effort to be more transparent, I'm laying out some of our technical product strategy for 2025. Here's what we're focusing on:



>**1/** **Passkey Wallet Infrastructure**  
  
The secp256r1 precompile coming in 2.2 unlocks a new era for smart wallets on Solana:  
\- Sign with FaceID  
\- Passkey login and Signin  
\- MPC wallets w/ biometric backups  
  
We're looking for teams to build example implementations and are helping teams integrate. We’re also supporting teams building infrastructure around this new curve

>  
**2/ Gasless Relayers**  
  
The Solana account model makes it extremely easy to pay for fees for other users. We're building a new gasless relayer to make it easier to pay for fees and use fees as a loyalty play  
  
Check out the spec: [https://forum.solana.com/t/srfc-34-standardized-relayer-api/2876](https://forum.solana.com/t/srfc-34-standardized-relayer-api/2876)  
  
If you want to alpha, DM!

>  
**3/ Solana Onchainkit**  
  
Blinks did a great job at making it easier to interact with programs but we want to push this further. We want to build the universal [@Solana](https://x.com/Solana) SDK:  
  
\- Standardized interface for every program  
\- Easier program composition  
\- Better transaction building  
\- Domain Resolution, Swaps, Fund w/ offramp, mint, etc



>  
**4/ On-chain Attestation Infrastructure**  
  
T22 extensions and attestations enable true institutional-grade permissioned systems on a permissionless chain. We're building SAS (Solana Attestation Service) for:  
\- Anti-sybil checks  
\- Accredited investor verification  
\- Trusted KYC signaling  
\- Other use cases of trusted offchain data  
  
We're looking to help teams that want to use onchain attestations for products like permissioned vaults and accredited/non-sybiled airdrops

>  
**5/ SocialFi Tooling**  
  
SocialFi is making waves and generating real volumes. See the thread here:  or reach out to [@voteforpedrito](https://x.com/voteforpedrito) for more information  
[https://x.com/pkxro/status/1883252933128831202](https://x.com/pkxro/status/1883252933128831202)

https://preview.redd.it/jsdj4mvejdge1.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4150274bf4cd95ff208b677c734bb17a865d3a6

>  
**6/ Fixing The Read Layer**  
  
The Solana read layer needs an overhaul. We're building a new independent version of the RPC and are experimenting with a more plug-and-play version that work in specific modes. E.g. historical accounts, streaming, simulate or just just JsonRPC  
  
Looking for a lot of ideas here as we start to build the spec and share it with the community (especially wrt: geyser)

>  
**7/ Mobile Tooling**  
  
Crypto is going mobile-first and our tooling needs to be best-in-class  
  
We're putting a lot of effort into making:  
\- Wallet adapter  
\- Mobile wallet adapter (kotlin)  
\- Mobile wallet adapter (swift)  
  
Spec compliant, usable and taking advantage of native features like FaceId,  secure enclave, NFC and more



>**8/ Token Extension Tooling**  
  
As we push to get more T22 adoption and integrations, we need to facilitate better tooling for minting, composing upon and making T22 more usable in payments and defi  
  
As scaled ui amount and IBE tokens get more attention we need to make sure explorers, wallets and apps support them in a meaningful and similar manner

  


>**9/ Usage Billed APIs**  
  
Similar to HTTP 402 Payment Required we're looking to extend functionality to support SPL-based billing for consuming API calls. We're experimenting with durable nonces, payment state channels and escrows to charge API consumers in crypto as a reverse proxy that sits in front of your server

>  
**10/ Security**  
  
Last year, we had very successful outcomes for our Security RFPs for monitoring and static analysis  
  
This year, we're looking to extend this with formal verification, differential fuzzing and token and account risk analysis.   
  
Additionally, for our AI goals, we'll put time into code understanding (think fine tuned Solana models and OSS datasets) for web3js and on-chain program development

>  
If you want to get involved in any of the above, have feedback, think of new ideas, please reach out! We'll have RFPs, grants, bounties and working groups for many of these as we look to continue to make Solana the best place to build products with real users and meaningful volumes

Edit: For those of you asking if I’m new, I am new to meme coins. I’ve never seen any value. I am not new to crypto.

I’ve been in bitcoin since 2012 or so. I bought in because I worked as a cyber security engineer on an early ransomeware case. I ended up buying bitcoin to pay the ransom by meeting a guy off Craigslist to buy a few bitcoin to pay the ransom. Since I didn’t want to have to do this in the future I bought a few to hold as well. Not because I was investing in some crypto but because people have been hacking for years for fee, bitcoin allowed them to get paid. I saw that as a huge reason for a need of bitcoin. So while I didn’t think it would go up as much as it I’d, I certainly didn’t think it was going to go down so I felt ok buying a few thousand dollars worth (luckily I forgot about it and sold a few years later for an insane amount of money).

I'm working with the DexScreener API to monitor Solana/Raydium pairs, but I've run into a limitation. The search endpoint (`/latest/dex/search?q=raydium+solana`) only returns 30 pairs, while the web interface shows many more.

**What I've tried:**

- Using the search endpoint: `https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/search?q=raydium+solana`

- Attempted different queries and parameters

- Checked the API documentation

**What I need:**

- Access to all or at least more Solana/Raydium pairs

- Ability to monitor newly launched pairs

- Real-time or near real-time data

The web interface (dexscreener.com) shows many more pairs when using filters.

Has anyone found a way to get more than 30 pairs from the API? Or is there perhaps an alternative endpoint I should be using?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Reddit,solana,Pump.fun potential beyond rug pulling?,2025-01-30 02:13:09,"I recently launched my own token on Pump.fun (yes, I am part of the problem :p) to experiment with crowdfunding for a documentary project I’m working on. It got me thinking—why do so many people dismiss the platform as just a pump-and-dump machine? of course that is what it is currently being used for...but it could also be used for legit use cases, ignoring the desperate pump and dumpers.

Could a platform like pump.fun be a real tool for raising funds? If you're upfront to your fans about holding a token and using profits to build something valuable, is that really a rug? Or is it just a way for early supporters and the creator to actually benefit?

Think about a small music band. I used to follow obscure artists—some blew up, some didn’t, but supporting them felt meaningful either way. Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invest in a band early and see your stake grow as they did? Even if you never cashed out, you'd still be part of something bigger.

I truly think people are missing something here. After using Pump.fun myself, I see how it could be a powerful way to fund creative projects. (My main contention being - If your community supports you, why would you ever want to rug them?)

Curious ... Am I off base, or is there potential here? 

I am considering using it as a way to support my documentary making on Youtube, because it is very costly to make them - I feel like it could be a good alternative beyond Patreon - But I wanted to get actual feedback from people who are closer/more knowledgeable than I am.

Wether you know something like it that already exists, think its a great idea, think it's a shite idea, want to team up or steal the idea, all feedback is welcome.

So having been involved in a number of Memecoin CTOs there is often a call for the community to donate a small amount of SOL to a donation/marketing wallet that can be used to promote the project, pay for DEX etc. The issue is no one trusts anyone so deciding whose wallet the contributions go to is always a challenge.

The idea is to have a dApp that has a wallet that has funds that can only be released by a majority vote made by all contributors (possibly weighted by your contribution size). So as an example, we raise 5 SOL for a trending placement, but in order to release that 5 SOL all contributors need to agree.

I’ve been into blockchain tech since around 2014, but have never had time to really develop anything cool. I’ve been doing research into Solana and it seems easier to create your own tokens and it’s a hell of a lot faster and easier to build smart contracts (programs I know) on this chain then dealing with Solidity on Ethereum. 

I’ve had several ideas for tokens & programs that actually could do cool things. Stuff like some gamification and anchoring to real world events that offer tokens as rewards. I don’t want to launch coins that just screw people over, I’d rather make cool things that generate some revenue for me and other users. I’ve also been working for other companies for long enough and would love to start my own projects to help add some extra money for my family and friends. 

The documentation is pretty solid and rust is relativity straight forward. Before I get started, I was wondering what the “legality” of this stuff is? 

Many of you guys have coins you have created and are earning revenue. One of the few good things about the current administration is that they are very pro crypto and deregulatory - seems like the perfect time to start my projects.

The current wallet I found has about a 94% profitability but the transactions and activity don't really seem to be that of a bot. 

Based on the transaction activity, the operating hours of the wallet appear to be from 7:00 AM the earliest to about 8 PM the latest, which is a pretty normal time period for a human to be trading.  I've yet to see a transaction earlier or later than this time period. 

Also, the wallet makes very little transactions. The number ranges from 1-4 transactions daily. There are no sporadic number of transactions made, they are all early buys that are held and net amazing profits.

The amount of money invested isn't exorbitant or miniscule either. I've seen $400 on the bottom end to as much as $11,000. $11,000 is quite a lot, but in comparison to the profit the wallet has made, it's very small. 

The one confusing thing is that they seem to be a very very VERY early buyer in a coin, and most of the coins they purchasing range from 15x to 200x profits. 

Which pretty much concludes this wallet is a sniper but I'm unsure whether it's a bot or not and wanted to see what kind of bot and parameters could possibly net this kind of success.

Reddit,solana,How the hell do I send my USDt and SOL out from a wallet ?,2025-01-30 14:31:04,"Edit : SOLVED : scroll down for the solution



Hi everyone, I hope anyone can bring me some help here. I posted on the Solana Stack exchange a few hours ago but my post was deleted without further notice.

To put it simply, I bought USDt on a CEX to send to my Cake wallet. Worked like a charm, everything is on my Cake wallet. Now the tough part is I've been trying for almost 24h to swap those USDt back to some other coins, but the app told me everytime I didn't have the funds.

After searching a lot (there really isn't a lot of easily accessible documentation about using Solana from a wallet !!) I understood I needed gas in SOL. I bought .03 SOL and send it to my account. That should do it for the fees right ?

Now I'm able to proceed further for the swap, but it still gives me an error, though a different one :

`Error processing instruction 0: invalid account data for instruction.`

I'm kinda lost. My address is a Token account, but it's really not clear if it should be or not, and I also have a non-Token address but I'm out of my depth here. At this point I regret using the SOL network at all for my USDt transfer, and I just want out as simply as possible. I have links to transactions if that's of any help.

Hope this is clear enough and if I can provide any useful data I will !

Cheers

Edit : clarity

Edit 2 : Deleted the term DEX as I in fact only use Cake wallet and Kraken. Just to avoid confusion from me using the wrong terms



**SOLUTION :**

I swapped all my USDt to SOL using **a proper Solana wallet (Solflare)** and it worked first try. In retrospect maybe it would have worked on Cake as well, and maybe it was only straight USDt to XMR that was impossible. Guess we'll never know.

  
So after swapping everything to SOL I was finally able to swap SOL to XMR using Cake again. It took like 5 attempts before I figured out the correct fee, which was **my balance minus 0.002005 SOL**, including the 0.002 for the rent and the 0.000005 for the transaction fee.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,solana,Bot that buys and sells right the way destroyed my chart,2025-01-30 03:48:16,"I’m very new to this and recently started using the Photon SOL platform. I like how much information it provides but sometimes a bot will buy around 2k SOL worth of a coin and sell it the next second. When that happens, the price spikes dramatically, creating a huge candle on the chart. Because the platform tries to fit that massive candle on the screen, everything else shrinks so much that I can barely see the other candles. For example if the actual price is around 0.10 but the bot’s trade pushes it to 1.6k for a moment, my entire chart becomes unusable since all the normal price movements are essentially invisible.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

However on ETH this is not as directly possible. Hence, (according to Alex) ETH will be the go-to crypto token for future developers, who are skittish about government intervention.

**Is this claim warranted?**

I’m unfamiliar with the debate so thanks for reading!

The challenge is that I only have the recipient's **Ethereum address**, but encryption typically requires their **public key**.

Since Ethereum addresses are derived from the public key but don’t expose it directly, I’m looking for the best approach to encrypt data for a recipient without having their full public key beforehand.

How to tackel this any idea??

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

Reddit,ethereum,I cant understand all this.,2025-01-26 15:40:20,"I'm currently preparing for in campus placements, and working on data structure and algorithms for hiring rounds. Meanwhile two people of my class magically somehow appear announce events about web3 blockchain etc etc and I'm not sure how they started getting funding for it. They went to Bangalore for some meetup, conducted some meetups in my city and now they arr going to eth denver, one of them posted about the visa approval and tickets to the event. I was stunned. I talked to them and they have become literally so arrogant about giving information, and said they don't give a fuck to studies of college. I'm not sure what they are doing to achieve so but for student like me willing to study hard, and earn success gets insecure about not knowing everything hi fi going [around.Read](http://around.Read) more

Here's the x profile of one of them [https://x.com/Aniketsahu\_115?t=Eg3DDS1brESKGXjQbLs2jQ&s=09](https://x.com/Aniketsahu_115?t=Eg3DDS1brESKGXjQbLs2jQ&s=09)

The things they are doing, if done by me (leadership, event, club bla bla) will serve as a good repose for my statement of purpose for higher studies.

Reddit,ethereum,I've created a Game and hidden seed words throughout it.,2025-01-25 10:07:53,"Hi reddit, I challenge you all.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

We hope you love it and have a nice day. **�**�",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO. FYI CEO of this company is doing a fireside chat on Tuesday in case you wanna shill an $ETH MicroStrategy approach for him lol.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

 * Beyond Transactions: Ethereum goes beyond simple currency transfers. It enables the creation of smart contracts – self-executing agreements with built-in rules – unlocking a world of possibilities.    
 * Decentralized Applications (dApps): From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming and beyond, Ethereum empowers developers to build innovative dApps that are secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship.  
 * A Thriving Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts a vibrant and active community of developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Blockchain Co-Founder for Nonprofit AI Language Startup (2000+ African Languages),2025-01-23 10:02:59,"**The Problem:**  
OpenAI, Meta, and Orange recently announced efforts to build AI for African languages. But here’s the catch: Africa has 2,000+ languages, many with little to no digital data. Without datasets, even the best AI models can’t bridge this gap.

**What We’re Doing:**  
We’re a nonprofit team building a blockchain and tokenomics-powered solution to crowdsource, validate, and incentivize the creation of African language datasets. Think decentralized data ownership, community-driven contributions, and equitable AI access.

**Who We Are:**

\- A team of **4 founders with 27+ combined years** in product development, startups, and AI/data systems.

\- Backgrounds: **AI engineer, Data Engineer, Statistician, Product Engineer, Non-profit and Funding**

\- Committed to impact over profit (**nonprofit structure**).

**We Need You:**

\- Blockchain/tokenomics expertise (Solana, Polygon, smart contracts, token design).

\- Technical enough to lead protocol development.

\- Aligned with the mission: Solve the data desert for African languages.

\- Comfortable with early-stage uncertainty (we’re pre-funding).

**No Fluff:**

\- This isn’t a “get rich quick” project, it is for the long haul. If you want hype, look elsewhere.

\- We’re not here to compete with OpenAI or any other AI war-lord—we’re solving the foundational problem they can’t ignore.

\- Remote work, no location preference.

**If This Resonates:**  
DM me with:

\- Your experience with blockchain projects

\- Why you would like to join us.

\- A brief intro about yourself

Let’s build something real.

P.S. Already working on African language datasets, blockchain for social impact, or decentralized AI? Let’s collaborate, not compete.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,bitcoin,Read this if you don't want to get banned - Trumpcoin & off-topic political commentary is not allowed here,2025-01-25 21:28:36,"I'm sure that you've noticed that we've been locking politically related threads in here lately and I'm going to explain why. We've been locking these threads because many of the commenters can't manage to stay on-topic when posting in threads that have anything to do with current politics. Many of the comments in these threads used to be insults, arguing about politics, and off-topic political commentary, and not about Bitcoin. But now after Trump's meme coin was recently released, more of the comments in these threads end up being about his shitcoin. It's typical for half of the comments in Trump related threads to either be about his shitcoin or about politics now, and not about bitcoin. This is why we've been locking these threads lately.

This is the Bitcoin subreddit. This is not the Trumpcoin sub. So stop commenting about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin. Everybody in this sub is aware of Trump's shitcoin. You don't need to keep posting about it. If you want to post comments about Trump's shitcoin, then head over to the sub for it and stop spamming about it in r\/Bitcoin. **Anybody that posts about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

This is not a politics subreddit. Stop posting off-topic political commentary in r\/Bitcoin. There are countless political subreddits where you can post about politics unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not one of them. **Anybody that posts political comments that are not about Bitcoin in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

Subsequent rule violators will be banned for longer than 1 week if we notice that you're a repeat offender.

Reddit,bitcoin,“Bitcoin is not backed by anything”,2025-02-01 11:38:48,"I was recently watching a finance podcast where the host responded to a question by someone pro Bitcoin. The host responded that “Bitcoin is all speculation and is not backed by anything”. 

Having read the white paper Satoshi makes a mention of the value at least being that of the energy expenditure to mine bitcoin and secure the network.

I somewhat get the concept of proof of work and energy being tied to value but is there a better explanation to bitcoins value besides this and a good rebuttal to someone saying it’s purely speculation?

Another reason I ask this is I recently found out that between the year 2100-2200 there will only be one bitcoin left to mine, and so, 100 years is a lot of energy to pump into one bitcoin. So with this in mind it makes sense for the price to very closely be correlated to energy consumption cost - if energy becomes really cheap by then what does that do to the cost of a bitcoin?

Please correct me if any of my statements are incorrect or misleading.

**Why, what?**

* Every time you receive Bitcoin, you create a UTXO ( like a “chunk” of BTC in your wallet). If you’ve DCA’d for months, swapped on Lightning, you probably have dozens of tiny UTXOs.
* More UTXOs = bigger, pricier transactions later. Each UTXO needs a separate transaction (sort of)
* Right now, consolidating (combining UTXOs) costs pennies. Later? Not so much.

**How to Clean Up Your UTXOs**  
*You’ll need a wallet with “coin control” – Electrum, Sparrow, BlueWallet, or most hardware wallets (Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard).*

1. **Check Your UTXOs** Open your wallet, find the coin control/UTXO section. Look for clusters of small UTXOs (like 0.0005 BTC or less).
2. **Pick the Ones to Merge** Select 10-20 of those tiny UTXOs. Don’t grab everything – leave a few for flexibility.
3. **Send Them to Yourself** Create a new receive address in your wallet. Send all the selected UTXOs to that address in one transaction. Set the fee to 2-3 sat/vB (it’ll confirm fast right now, you might need to increase this later).
4. **Repeat If Needed** Do this in batches if you’ve got hundreds of UTXOs. No rush – just get it done while fees are low.

This isn’t urgent. Take your time, double-check addresses, test with small amounts first.

**Final Note**  
The mempool won’t stay empty forever. Bull runs always bring congestion, and fees *will* pump again. Spend 10 minutes today to save yourself rage and wasted cash later. It felt like a good exercise to break out my old ledger again today.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,bitcoin,Looking for Beta Testers for BTC Notify App,2025-02-01 10:43:08,"Hi fellow bitcoiners!

I was to enslaved checking the bitcoin price chart all day, so I solved my own problem by building a simple android app which notifies me when the price crosses a certain price point. E.g. every 1000 in-/decrease. When the price stays in the same range I just don't get any notifications, which is really relaxing haha.

This is a free and open-source app, and to make it easy for others to install I wanted to publish it to the Play Store. The problem is that I tried multiple times with 12 testers to get it through but Google wants me to test it more. (Probably not enough usage since you just get notifications and that's it.)

I would really appreciate if you guys would join the Google test group, try the app, and leave some feedback! Here is how to join:

1. Join the Google group: [https://groups.google.com/g/btc-notify-testers](https://groups.google.com/g/btc-notify-testers)
2. Become a tester and install the app: [https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.bitcoin.btcnotify](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.bitcoin.btcnotify)

It said my email was already registered, so I went through the process to get logged in.  Low and behold ...there sat $34,243.10 in my asset account!  I couldn't believe it...the questions that rolled through my brain...is this real....how had I completely forgotten about this...why didn't I buy a whole coin, or two...

Reddit,bitcoin,Time to refer to it as an 'exchange rate',2025-01-31 16:33:42,"I propose that we stop talking about the 'price' of BTC and start talking about it's 'exchange rate' with various kinds of fiat.

BTC is able to move up and down in orders of magnitude. Up until the $100k/coin and below order of magnitude (e.g. the $100 to $1k, $1k to $10k, the $10k to $100k), it was still smaller than most currencies in total market cap. That isn't true about the $100k to $1M range. At this range now, it is eclipsing the small currencies and closing in on the big ones. As such, it is now time to refer to it's change rate rather than price. You don't buy bitcoin with fiat as though fiat is the basic measure of value. You have exchange rates among the major stores of value. ",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

For context: I sold my car and moved to a walkable city last year, so this money is my “future fund.” I’m risk-aware but don’t want to gamble. My plan is to spread buys over 12-24 months, but I'm looking for some input here.

Everyone says “just DCA and hold,” but are there actually better methods for larger sums? I'm especially worried about entering at this point in the market with a lump sum for example.

Also, what exchanges are the go-to for Europeans? I keep hearing horror stories about withdrawals getting frozen.

Imagine this: you’re on a flight, texting your family that you’ll see them in 5–10 minutes. Then, in an instant, you're 50 feet deep in cold, dark water.

Personally, I store my BTC securely on a hardware wallet. I have a will set up with detailed, step-by-step instructions for my family to retrieve it. My wallet is protected with a passphrase (25th word), which only they and I know. Even if someone broke into my home and stole my instructions, my BTC would still be safe.

I have an excel spreadsheet (local file, not office365) that's password-encrypted with AES-256. That file exists on my local computer, and in the cloud (will explain)... and on a USB key that's in a bank SDB.

The local file and its cloud version get changed once a week for whatever reason. The bank gets a USB refresh whenever I wander in there in person (once every couple of months perhaps).

The cloud one is in my Apple Notes... the XLS is embedded into a Note, and the note itself is password-encrypted (AES-256 as well)... so to get at this, you'd have to crack into my Apple environment, find the note, crack its encryption (age of universe), then get the XLS and crack that again.

I'm very comfortable with this set-up, and don't mind telling people in detail because I have zero concern this is in any way vulnerable. 

But, maybe I missed something. Is there a crack in this armour?

Before i start, i apologize for my english, i hope i can make it thru to you anyway.   
Also, scammers dont even bother.   
I have the 12 word phrase, i got the pin-code.   
  
Me and my GF we're looking at some photos of me and my family when i was a kid. This box ive had since i moved away from home. I havent watched inside the box for many many years. I do invest some. Some crypto currency as a noob on coinbase, not understanding things at all but gaining some small profits. This i have been doing for 5-6 months now. 

While we are looking in the box opening alot of photo albums etc. I see that i have one box inside where on the box it says ""Never throw away"" i open it and its just more photos of me and my family and stuff i made when i was a toddler. Looking further i can see a envelope that says ""open in the future, dont be greedy 2013."" I do recall somthing like this. I cant pin point exactly wtf ive might put inside the envelope, but it got intresting. My GF obviously asap told me to open it, but i said idk i might keep it for some more years since im telling my future self to chill and not be greedy (yes, i guess i was greedy but imo 12 years is the future for me.) 

Opening of the envelope:   
Sure, im a noob on crypto and everything around it. But i understood what it was asap. I see the 12 words phrase and i can see the pin. Also theres some calculations pretty sloppy typed, basicly i think i did a easy calculation on how much it has to reach to be 1 milion in my FIAT value. 

Basicly, i dont remember shit of this. I do remember i had a nerdy friend from high school back then doing stuff like this. But mostly he bought drugs and sketchy shit from silk road etc also i remember he was always talking about bitcoin and how he could buy hes weed without being traced. Imo i just thought ""good for him"" since i didnt give a shit about what he does, i just do me and chill infront of my world of warcraft owning. 

Then it hit me. I do recall somthing with bitcoin. I cant really pin point exactly what i was doing. I did have a job, and always had some steady income monthly. I do save money every month and always had. But back in 2013 when i moved out from my family home to my own place, i do recall i did buy somthing on the internet who was to me back then, pretty sketchy cause this was not how transactions on the internet worked (to my knowledge). Since i cant remember exactly im not sure what i did. But i do know, after i did that buy, i told myself to never trust a transaction thru the internet if its not a company or bank (somthing that exist in the real world) 

  
Realizing more and more when im writing this text this might just be nothing at all. Maybe i did open a wallet to just see wtf this is or maybe i even tried to become a trader back then. I dont know...

  
For conclusion: I need help. Ive googled some and made it down to where i use Electrum or Bitcoin Core. No success tho. 

  
Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Monthly Optimists Discussion - February 2025,2025-02-01 10:04:29,"Welcome to the Monthly Optimists Discussion thread. As the title implies, the purpose of this thread is to promote discussion which is guardedly optimistic about cryptocurrency topics. This thread is intended to be a counterweight to the Skeptics Discussion thread and will be pinned when the markets are bearish.

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence. For example, announcing an obscure online store is adopting coin X for payments and then speculate Amazon will adopt it next without evidence. Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator. Please report shilling or any comments which violate the rules.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What's the reason crypto community members tend to worship certain indivudals?,2025-02-01 10:29:31,"I've always found this one a bit strange, when you consider the nature of crypto.

Most crypto holders can agree on decentralisation, power to the people, F the banks and some even argue for lack of regulation in spite of scams.

So isn't it ironic that when you look at many of the top coins, many of those 'communities' tend to idolise 1 or even 2 people? Not to even go looking into shitcoins where the fantasy can get even worse sometimes (Look at HEX worshipping their number 1 scammer Richard Heart like a God, it's bizarre).

I'm going to list a few top examples, and if this touches a nerve with you well maybe you're in my example:

\- Cardano community members idolising Charles Hoskinson

\- Dogecoin and Elon Musk

\- Eth and Vitalik

\- AlgoNauts jumping to the defence of their Foundation every single time someone questions the dumping

\- In the past, Luna (""Lunatics community) and Do Kwon

\- Heck, even head over to Bitcoin sub and you will see not 1 but 2 individuals being worshipped, Saylor gets more mentions than Satoshi these days and weirdly gets praised for being a genius all the time (because he buys BTC and shills it? lol)

I know what some of y'all might probably reply, ""Of course the creator gets worshipped!"". But to me it's very weird to see an entire community of grown men worship another dude as if he's a celebrity, in a space where everyone raves about decentralisation but once you see something gets small criticism an army of these supporters come to the rescue of their hero or rich billionaire.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Buying alt coins that have vanished,2025-01-31 22:59:37,"Hi accountants, we can get tax deductions on our loses. After making profits in this cycle I want to sell or offset my loses by selling coins that went to zero in 2017. Literally $2000 down to $0.

But we can't sell, we have the coins in the wallet but coin has rugged and disappeared from this planet.

This coin has disappeared so how can we get a tax deduction with it? including the exchange saying you can't sell your tokens try transfering to another wallet. If I transfer to another wallet that doesn't do anything as coins are no longer in existence. The project is deleted.

Can we burn the coin or put in a fake address that goes to thin air in this case we can have a so called sell invoice to claim on tax?

Or is a screenshot of the value good enough for tax? Baught $2000 in 2017 - current wallet value $0 in 2025.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: thanks for your comments.

I've emailed the exchange and they emailed me a receipt with 33cents lol, and removed the coins from my account with no fees. It's a win, it was worth zero on my side. Easy tax deduction on the zillion I made and will make this cycle. A few years ago they weren't this helpful which I was surprised they did it so easily this time, literally not even 15 minutes.

I received over 250 billion coins worth over $47,000. I panicked for second, thinking I accidentally bought more than I wanted and check the blockchain transaction. No, I really spent like $40 something dollars and my coinbase wallet was showing me $47,000 of coins. 

Problem is I’ve tried transferring to a stable coin to cash out, I’ve tried swapping it for another coin, bridging it to another network. Every time I try to move it, the value reverts back to what it would’ve been if I had bought $50. I’ve even tried to send $500 of these coins to a friend and it shows up in their wallet as a fraction ($0.11) of the coins my wallet is showing me I sent. 

I had an extra $14 worth of Polygon hanging out in my wallet so I bought more XEN. It added another $12,000 to my wallet.

As the title implies, the purpose of this thread is to promote rational discussion about cryptocurrency related topics but with an emphasis on skepticism. This thread is intended to be an outlet for critical discussion, since it is often suppressed. 

Please read the rules and guidelines before participating.

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator.

I can't find anything online; no cryptos called Shift. Maybe it doesn't exist anymore. Maybe it isn't actually called Shift as I've rewritten and reorganized my notes a few times since and may have mixed things up. 

Is there a way I can check the public address to see what's on there? The problem is I have no idea what block chain it's on. Or could I try a few hot wallets with the 12 word seed and see if any of them can 'connect'. I've kind of forgotten how all this stuff works so maybe that's not the right way to go about it.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Ability to Delay Transactions and Call Them Back?,2025-01-31 20:33:47,"Hi everyone,

An Idea

With crypto becoming more and more mainstream. it got me thinking if there was a way to implement to delay a transaction and call it back? My thinking is if you start a transaction on Solana or ETH. You can select a delay period of your choice so 1 hour or even up to 24 hours. In this period the the transaction can be put on hold and also ""Semi-confirmed"" (Confirmed but waiting for the delay period) The crypto will be put on hold in neither your wallet or the recipients wallet. There will be a receipt in each wallet so you can confirm your funds will make it to the recipients wallet. In this period if you change your mind you can call the transaction back.

Why would you want this?

I've been in crypto for over 10 years. I see new people entering the market all the time. One thing I see all the time is people sending crypto to the wrong address or sending an unsupported crypto. With this approach you could confirm your funds will make it. Also you could call back the transaction if you realise you made a mistake. You could also set limits so anything over $1000 will always have a hold period of 1 hour or so! I think something like this could be a game changer for new people and folks with large amounts of funds!

Example

You could send the transaction with 1 hour conformation. You get a receipt and the merchant gets a receipt into there wallet. In your wallet you could have outgoing and incoming receipts for example. Your wallet confirms that the receipt has successfully landed in the merchants address. You can verify it on there website or on the block chain. This is known as ""Semi Verified"" you can either then wait 1 hour or push the transaction through.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Black Rock is positioning to control Crypto cycles,2025-02-01 02:26:06,"So Black rock, the multi trillion dollar entity that has it's fingers in all the stock market pies, has been buying up Bitcoin at an ever increasing rate.

Now it has ETF's and growing investors to fuel the buying, alongside a very disturbing amount of Bitcoin.

Black rock now owns 6% of all Bitcoin via it's ETF's.

This means it can create liquidation cycles just by selling Bitcoin.

It can position itself into alt coins that follow Bitcoins movements, and simply short them with precision timing, dropping the price of Bitcoin and then buying up those alt coin at cheaper prices.

Then it can buy Bitcoin again, enter the alt coins and grow those positions, eventually owning enough of a percentage, that it can drop the price of Bitcoin again and sell those alt coin positions off while simultaneously shorting them.

Rinse and repeat for control via ownership.

Black rock is setting up to completely take over Crypto.

Bitcoin is no longer accepted to pay taxes, and business are no longer obligated to offer/accept Bitcoin payment. This was part of the IMF deal that Bukele had to do in order to get a needed rescue loan. The faith of the Chivo Wallet, a custodial wallet created by the salvadoran government, is still unclear. The following weeks are crucial to find out if the Chivo Wallet will be acquired by a private company or just shut down completely. 

Almost FOUR YEARS ago I predicted that the Bitcoin Law was going to fail misserably, because El Salvador doesn't have the infrastructure to deal with regular credit card payments, and adding cryptocurrency payments was never gonna take off. Besides that, salvadorans lack tech knowledge to actually use crypto for their every day activities.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Chainlink (LINK) Just Launched the DeFi Yield Index (CDY Index) - A Game Changer for Onchain Lending,2025-01-30 14:52:10,"Just came across with this Chainlink [Tweet ](https://x.com/chainlink/status/1884951234840240385)that announces a new data product they have launched, Chainlink DeFi Yield Index (CDY Index) which aggregates market wide DeFi lending rates using Chainlink standard.

This is a very important development for institutional adoption of DeFi tracking. As you know, data reliablitiy is very important and one of the biggest barriers for traditional finance (TradFi) users entering DeFi is the lack of reliable aggregated data on lending yields. CDY index goal is to solve this problem standardizing and simplifying access to real time on chain lending rates data. Now you dont have to manually track different protocols and compare them falling into a mess of different data. Now they can easily have a clear picture of DeFi lending opportunities at once.

https://preview.redd.it/oa56c8aw95ge1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abe4d384bc13743ee4bd6ded99292da6c045b232

To achieve this product they have used Space and Time (SxT) technology for the calculation process. This tech ensures that the index is robust, tamper proof, etc. making this data valuable for institutions. This whole process is also decentralized and makes the data also transparent, accurate and resistant to manipulation.

This tool is not only useful for institutions, it is also for individuals that want to compare yields across protocols instead of having to join multiple platforms to find the best rates.

Another step forward to reduce the gap between DeFi and TradFi and making things a lot more easier.

**What is lending yield?**

Lending yield is the money a lender earns from making loans and it is usually a %. It comes from interest and fees paid by borrowers.

Crypto, by its nature, does not meet the criteria of traditional financial markets. It is not regulated, and there are no standardized rules or frameworks governing its operation. Most of these shitcoins are created with little to no actual value backing them, and investors are well aware of this fact when they decide to buy. In fact, many people buy these coins knowing full well that they could be part of a pump-and-dump scheme, which is commonplace in the crypto space.

Given this context, if a CFA or any financial professional were to rug a shitcoin, they aren’t committing an unethical act. There is no fiduciary duty or regulatory oversight in play with such speculative and volatile investments. Crypto operates in a lawless, wild west environment where participants are fully responsible for their own risks.

As we enter 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape has evolved significantly, driven by regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and technological advancements. What was once considered a niche asset class has now become an integral part of the global financial system, reshaping traditional banking, investment strategies, and digital commerce.

# Regulation: A Double-Edged Sword

One of the most defining aspects of the crypto market in 2025 is the establishment of clearer regulations across major economies. The U.S., European Union, and several Asian nations have implemented structured guidelines that define how cryptocurrencies can be issued, traded, and taxed. While some early adopters feared that regulation would stifle innovation, it has instead provided legitimacy, encouraging more institutional investors and mainstream businesses to participate.

Governments have also made significant progress in implementing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which now coexist with decentralized cryptocurrencies. While CBDCs offer efficiency and stability, many crypto enthusiasts remain wary of potential privacy concerns and government control over financial transactions.

# Institutional Adoption and Mainstream Integration

By 2025, traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) are no longer separate entities but interwoven components of the financial ecosystem. Major banks and asset management firms have embraced tokenized assets, allowing investors to trade tokenized versions of real estate, stocks, and commodities on blockchain networks.

Leading payment processors now support direct cryptocurrency payments, reducing reliance on fiat currency for cross-border transactions. Retailers and e-commerce platforms accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins as common payment methods, further cementing crypto’s role in everyday transactions.

# Bitcoin and Ethereum: Still Dominant, but Evolving

Bitcoin remains the most widely recognized cryptocurrency, but its role has shifted toward being a store of value, akin to digital gold. Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network have enhanced Bitcoin’s scalability, making it more efficient for microtransactions.

Ethereum, on the other hand, has continued to dominate smart contract platforms, with Ethereum 2.0 fully operational and significantly reducing energy consumption. The shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has made Ethereum a more sustainable and scalable ecosystem, powering decentralized applications (dApps) across finance, gaming, and identity verification.

# The Rise of AI and Blockchain Convergence

Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have formed a powerful synergy in 2025. Smart contracts powered by AI enable more autonomous decision-making, reducing inefficiencies in supply chains, healthcare, and governance. Decentralized AI networks allow users to rent out computing power for machine learning applications, creating new economic opportunities.

# Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite these advancements, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty in some regions, security risks like smart contract exploits, and ongoing debates over decentralization versus control continue to shape the industry’s trajectory. However, the fundamental promise of cryptocurrency—financial sovereignty, transparency, and efficiency—remains intact.

As 2025 unfolds, the crypto industry stands at the crossroads of mass adoption and further innovation, proving that digital assets are no longer just an experiment but a permanent fixture in the global economy.As we enter 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape has evolved significantly, driven by regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and technological advancements.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies Aren’t Cryptocurrencies; They’re Cryptomarkers,2025-01-31 15:24:44,"
Imagine someone offers you a 100-unit Monopoly bill in exchange for your phone. Would you accept it? Probably not. But why?

It’s not because the bill is made of paper or because Monopoly is a game - it’s because those 100 units don’t represent anything outside the game. They exist only within the rules of Monopoly. There’s no way to compare them against real-world goods and services because they serve no purpose beyond their ability to be exchanged for them.

Now, imagine that instead of 100 units, the bill says 500 or even 1,000 units. Would that change anything? No. The number of units is irrelevant if there is no external purpose anchoring them to reality. Without something to compare against, a rational exchange is impossible. If you agreed to the trade, you’d essentially be giving away your phone for free, with the bill merely acting as a marker signifying that.

Cryptocurrency units have the same fundamental problem as the units on the Monopoly bill. What do they represent outside of just being assigned to addresses, signifying that holders of these addresses gave up electricity or another purposeful item? What purpose do they serve beyond mere exchangeability? None. Their entire existence is limited to moving from one market participant to another.

They are stored on blockchains, recorded in digital wallets, and assigned to addresses, but that’s it. Whether an address holds one unit or a million, those units don’t serve any external function and, therefore, don’t create any reference point for comparison against real goods and services.

Unlike Monopoly or cryptocurrency units, fiat currency units serve purposes beyond market exchange. Because they are created as debt, this provides them with an external reference point. They can:

A) Redeem bank loans. Commercial banks put these units into circulation through loans and accept them back to settle those loans. Borrowers use them for this purpose daily.

B) Redeem collateral held by banks. If borrowers default on their loans, banks foreclose on their property - cars, houses, land, etc. As financial institutions, banks cannot keep this property. They are legally required to close the issued but unpaid loans, meaning they must withdraw the units from the market. That’s why they redeem them at auctions for foreclosed property.

C) Redeem government bonds. Central banks put these units into circulation by purchasing government bonds, which is why governments need them to repay those bonds.

These functions create a reference point for currency units. For example, if 10,000 units can save a car from foreclosure, those units have a reference point in the car. If they can save a house, they have a reference point in a house. And because a car and a house have practical uses, like goods and services do, we can compare them to other goods and services. This makes it possible to measure the purchasing power of the units in terms of real-world items.

Since cryptocurrency units are not issued as debt, nor they have tangible uses like gold, there is no reference point to compare them against anything real. This makes them markers, not money.

But markers of what? Markers of participation in schemes where people give away purposeful items for free with the hope that other participants will give them more such items in the future. When you see something like “ETH/USD 3,100,” it is a fake market quote. It is not the price of an asset being exchanged since all assets have purposes outside market exchange. Instead, it represents a participant giving away 3,100 units of a real asset for free and being assigned one digital unit to mark their participation in the scheme. With no external purpose for the unit, the participant is left waiting for another participant to bring them something purposeful, continuing the cycle.

This operation is a classic pyramid-like, participation-driven scheme. The only difference is that instead of hierarchical lists, it uses digital markers to track participants. Since anyone with basic technical knowledge can create such a scheme and write code to track it, we are witnessing an inflation of these marking systems- falsely labeled as cryptocurrencies. The right name would be ""cryptomarkers."" All schemes tracked by these systems are bound to collapse, as they rely entirely on the continuous influx of new participants contributing purposeful items, with nothing sustaining them beyond that.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

The private key is any 256-bit number in [0, N] where N is the order of the curve. So if I have a random 64-byte stream, the probability of it being a valid EC public key on the curve is `N / 2^512 = 2^256 / 2^512 = 2^{-256}`. Does this sound right?

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"". So then how would I find the probabilty of a random 32-byte stream being a valid EC public key on the (secp256k1) curve? Does the probability remain the same?",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

It then says that:

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

Reddit,crypto,Is there a name for this ‘inverse MOV’ attack and does it work in specialised cases?,2025-01-09 11:41:49,"The MOV attack works by choosing an elliptic curve with a small embedding degree then using a Tate pairing to map from the curve to a finite field, where the discrete log is sub-exponential.

Can you go the other way? Choose an elliptic curve over a small (~ 2^24 ) finite field with a fairly large embedding degree (~ 125). Then present adversaries with a large (2^(24*125) ) finite field Diffie Hellman protocol, which you then map back to the small curve for which discrete log is easy?

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };
    
    struct xws initializer(__uint128_t x_init, __uint128_t weyl_init, const __uint128_t s_init)
    {
        __uint128_t x = 0;
        __uint128_t weyl = 0;
        __uint128_t s = 0;
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++)

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The latest version of the code can be seen in the PR: [https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9)",2025-02-01 12:16:21.948978
