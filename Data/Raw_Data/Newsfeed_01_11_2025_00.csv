Despite the drop, the popular meme coin still holds a bullish structure, keeping investors optimistic about its potential for recovery. However, the current levels are critical, as Dogecoin is testing key demand zones that could determine its next move. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? Top analyst and trader BigCheds recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that DOGE is testing crucial demand at $0.31 on the daily time frame. This level has historically acted as a strong support zone, and holding above it could set the stage for a bounce and continuation of its bullish trend. Conversely, a failure to maintain this level might open the door to further downside. Market sentiment remains cautious following the broader crypto market’s decline, but DOGE’s ability to hold current levels could restore investor confidence. All eyes are now on whether the meme coin can defend this key support and potentially pave the way for a new rally or if additional selling pressure will lead to a deeper correction. Dogecoin Holds Pivotal Support as 2025 Begins The start of 2025 has taken a different tone for Dogecoin compared to the explosive end of 2024. Beginning in early November, DOGE experienced a massive price surge, gaining over 230% in less than three weeks. This meteoric rise saw the meme coin reach significant levels, reigniting interest and optimism among investors. However, since finding a local high, Dogecoin has entered a consolidation phase, testing critical levels of support. Currently, Dogecoin is trading around $0.31, a key daily demand level identified by top analyst BigCheds. In his recent technical analysis, BigCheds emphasizes the importance of this support zone, as it could determine the next major move for the cryptocurrency. If DOGE manages to hold above $0.31, it sets the stage for a potential breakout into higher prices, reigniting the bullish momentum seen in late 2024. This consolidation phase is being closely monitored by traders and investors, as Dogecoin’s ability to maintain its bullish structure depends on this level. A clean bounce from the $0.31 demand could trigger renewed buying pressure, propelling DOGE toward new highs. Conversely, losing this critical support might signal a deeper correction, testing lower levels before any recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Downswing To $2,900 Could Be A ‘Buy-The-Dip Opportunity’ – Analyst Expects Bullish Surge As the broader market also finds its footing, Dogecoin’s performance at this pivotal level will likely influence its trajectory for the coming weeks. A successful defense of $0.31 could mark the beginning of another significant rally, solidifying DOGE’s position as a top contender in the cryptocurrency space. DOGE Eyes A Breakout Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.33, showing resilience after holding above the critical $0.31 demand level. This support has provided a foundation for DOGE to stabilize following the recent market selloff. However, the cryptocurrency remains at risk as long as it continues to trade below the $0.40 mark, a level that could reignite bullish momentum. For bulls to regain control, the price must reclaim $0.40 decisively. This would signal a shift in sentiment and provide the momentum needed to challenge the $0.43 mark. Breaking above $0.43 is a crucial milestone for Dogecoin, as it would likely trigger a significant rally into price discovery, attracting renewed interest from investors and traders. Related Reading: Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point Conversely, failing to reclaim $0.40 in the near term keeps DOGE vulnerable to further downside. Prolonged trading below this level increases the risk of a deeper correction, potentially testing lower levels of demand. The next few days will be pivotal for Dogecoin’s trajectory, as the broader market sentiment and DOGE’s ability to reclaim key levels will determine its direction. If bulls succeed in pushing above $0.43, the meme coin could quickly gain momentum, solidifying its place as a market leader in this cycle.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is Dogecoin’s 30% Decline A Chance To Buy On Discount? Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch,2025-01-10 23:00:11+00:00,"Recent price action has seen Dogecoin stuck in a correction path for over a month now, and the meme now finds itself trading just above the $0.3 mark. Particularly, Dogecoin has retraced by about 30% since it reached a recent multi-year peak of $0.48 in early December, and bullish traders are now patiently waiting for the next leg up.  According to technical analysis, Dogecoin’s recent confluence at the $0.3 price level presents an attractive opportunity to load up more of the cryptocurrency before an upward bounce from here. Dogecoin’s $0.3 Support Zone Holds Key Significance The $0.3 price level has emerged as a critical support zone for the meme coin moving forward, with multiple analyses referencing this price point. According to a technical analysis of Dogecoin’s daily candlestick price action on the TradingView platform, this level aligns with historical support zones that have previously served as reliable demand areas during market downturns. The technical appeal of this zone is more notable due to its correlation with broader market sentiment, as the Bitcoin price is currently hovering near its own significant support level. Related Reading: What To Expect After The Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 With this in mind, Dogecoin’s retracement to $0.3 could not only serve as a potential bottom for the current correction but also as a launching pad for the next bullish wave, provided Bitcoin and other market conditions align favorably. Furthermore, it provides traders the opportunity to load up more Dogecoin tokens at a 30% discount and position themselves for maximum gains before the wider crypto market recovers and resumes its upward momentum. Is A Broader Market Recovery On The Horizon? As one of the largest cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is easily influenced by market dynamics, including things like news updates and Bitcoin’s price action. Particularly, Dogecoin’s upward momentum in the last quarter of 2024 had no reason to be derailed if not for Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the psychological $100,000 price level.    Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Unsurprisingly, on-chain data shows some Dogecoin whale addresses might already be capitalizing on this discount in anticipation of this market-wide recovery. Whale transactions involving Dogecoin recently surged by over 400%. Furthermore, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin’s large transaction volume recently rose to over $60.9 billion in a 24-hour timeframe. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3328 and is down by about 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The $0.3 price level remains a pertinent range to keep an eye on, as a successful defense of this level paired with strengthening BTC prices could lay the groundwork for a renewed Dogecoin rally. A prudent approach would be to set stop losses below this level in case of a deeper correction, which could invalidate short-term bullish momentum.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Anthony Scaramucci’s 2025 Crypto Picks: Top Altcoins To Buy This Year,2025-01-10 21:30:30+00:00,"In an interview with popular crypto-focused YouTube channel Altcoin Daily, veteran financier and SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci revealed his top altcoins to buy and hold in 2025. Scaramucci, a former White House Communications Director and longtime Wall Street professional, provided his insights on various crypto assets—starting with his bullish stance on Ethereum (ETH) and expanding to a range of altcoins he believes will play a central role in shaping the future of decentralized technology. Ethereum: The Long-Term Crypto Winner Scaramucci began by identifying Ethereum as one of his key picks for the coming years. According to him, Ethereum’s market perception has undergone cyclical changes, which he likened to trends going “in and out of fashion.” Reflecting on his decades of experience in traditional finance, Scaramucci explained: Related Reading: Crypto Market Will Peak In Mid To Late March, Predicts Arthur Hayes “When I got into the industry, biotech stocks were hot, then it flipped over to insurance stocks, and then it was the world of alternative investing in hedge funds […] We go through waves and cycles of what’s in and out of fashion. And so weirdly, Ethereum is like out of fashion a little bit, which I’m surprised by because it’s got such great applications and it’s got a muscularity to it […] and it’s got dominance. So I do believe Ethereum is a winner, and I think it’s a long-term winner.” The billionaire investor underscored Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, highlighting its wide-ranging utility and established track record. His view is that while newer chains may offer speed and lower costs, Ethereum still holds a vital position as the smart contract platform of choice for countless decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Solana (SOL) After reaffirming his faith in Ethereum, Scaramucci turned his attention to Solana (SOL), touting its performance and cost-effectiveness: “I think that Solana—it’s cheaper and faster, and now that network is handling lots of volume. It’s got a good cross-section of different things going on […] We’re long a lot of Solana. I’ll be fully disclosed and tell you that.” Polkadot (DOT) Continuing his survey of promising altcoins, Scaramucci singled out Polkadot (DOT) for its potential in Web3 and gaming: “I own Polkadot. I like what Polkadot is capable of doing in the gaming industry, and I’m still a big believer that Web3 gaming will happen […] There’ll be sort of a Renaissance there.” Related Reading: Best Altcoins In 2025: Top Analyst Reveals His Picks He drew an analogy between today’s early-stage Web3 environment and the era of VHS tapes and Blockbuster Video. While it may be difficult to visualize the full potential of blockchain-based gaming experiences right now, Scaramucci believes Polkadot’s interoperability-focused platform could be instrumental in powering immersive digital ecosystems that lie just over the horizon. Avalanche (AVAX) Scaramucci did not stop there, briefly touching on Avalanche (AVAX) as another network he foresees doing well in the broader crypto market. Although he provided fewer specific details, his endorsement points to Avalanche’s known strengths—scalability, fast finality, and a growing suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. “I think Avalanche will do well,” he stated. Algorand (ALGO) Turning to Algorand, Scaramucci shared insights from his personal holding in the asset, which he’s maintained for four years. Acknowledging the platform’s management shifts, he nevertheless remains optimistic: “I think [Algorand] lost a step when they made some management changes, but there’s a guy by the name of John Wood there […] I think he’s a very, very, very smart guy, and he’s putting some stuff together there, and I think that one is undervalued.” Sui And Aptos Rounding out his altcoin picks, Scaramucci also named Sui (SUI) and Aptos (APT) as projects with solid long-term prospects: “Sui and Aptos—I’m a long-term believer in those as well. I don’t think there’ll be one chain.” Ultimately, Scaramucci illustrated his broader stance on the crypto asset landscape, underlining Bitcoin as the undisputed market leader, yet insisting that alternative blockchains will also play crucial roles: “Bitcoin is the pope, but there’s a college of cardinals… that will be very useful in terms of what their applications are and their networks ultimately become over the next five to fifteen years.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,319.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K,2025-01-10 20:00:17+00:00,"Bitcoin experienced significant selling pressure after successfully breaking above the $100K mark, a psychological milestone that had investors buzzing with optimism. However, the celebration was short-lived as BTC failed to hold this critical level, dropping as low as $92,500 in less than three days. This sharp downturn has reignited concerns about the market’s stability and Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its upward momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Downswing To $2,900 Could Be A ‘Buy-The-Dip Opportunity’ – Analyst Expects Bullish Surge Axel Adler, a prominent CryptoQuant analyst, shared valuable insights into the recent market activity. He revealed that the largest deleveraging in the past week took place between January 6 and 7, when Bitcoin’s price fell from $102K to $100K due to liquidations. This wave of forced selling pushed prices lower, allowing bears to regain control and drive Bitcoin’s price down further to $92,500. The current market conditions have left investors questioning Bitcoin’s next move. Will it stabilize and find support to mount another rally, or will the bearish momentum lead to a deeper correction? With the market sentiment teetering between fear and cautious optimism, all eyes remain on Bitcoin as it navigates this critical phase.  Bitcoin Regains Ground After Aggressive Sell-Off Despite experiencing an aggressive drop that saw Bitcoin plummet to $92K, the cryptocurrency has managed to find key support at this critical level. In the past few hours, BTC has pushed above this threshold, climbing to $95K, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. The ability to hold and rebound from this support level suggests potential resilience, but uncertainties remain. Prominent CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared insightful data on X about the recent market dynamics. He noted that the largest deleveraging in the last week occurred between January 6 and 7, when Bitcoin’s price dropped from $102K to $100K due to a wave of liquidations. This liquidation event wiped out overleveraged positions and set the stage for bearish activity. Capitalizing on the chaos, bears opened shorts, further driving the price down to $92K. Despite the recent recovery, Adler warns that the current 9K BTC reduction in open interest (OI) doesn’t provide a definitive signal of pressure easing in the market. This leaves Bitcoin’s next move uncertain, with investors closely watching how the price action unfolds in the coming days. Related Reading: Expert Sets $1 Target For Dogecoin Once It Breaks A Multi-Year Trend – Details The recovery to $95K is a positive sign, but BTC must reclaim higher levels to confirm bullish momentum and stabilize the market. Until then, traders remain cautious as the potential for further volatility looms. BTC Holds Key Level: Bulls Eye Higher Ground Bitcoin is trading at $95,000, holding above a critical support level and sitting just 2% below its 4-hour 200 EMA at $96,200. The 200 MA, another significant indicator, lies 3% away, adding further importance to Bitcoin’s current position. These technical levels are pivotal for assessing short-term market momentum and potential bullish recovery. For bulls to reclaim the uptrend, the $95K level must hold as a foundation for further upward movement. A decisive push to reclaim the $98K and $100K levels is crucial. These price points serve as key resistance levels that, once surpassed, could set the stage for a robust leg up, paving the way for Bitcoin to revisit its all-time highs. Failing to hold above $95K could open the door to increased bearish pressure, potentially sending BTC into a deeper consolidation or even testing lower demand zones. However, holding the line at current levels and building momentum could restore investor confidence and create the conditions needed for a sustained rally.

Based on this pattern, the analyst explained why the Bitcoin price could rally to as high as $169,000 in this cycle.  Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $169,000 As Fractal Pattern Appears In an X post, Master Kenobi predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to $169,000 as a similar fractal pattern from the previous bull cycle is again unfolding. The analyst noted that daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) measurements indicate that this fractal phase lasted 157 days last year.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not The End Of The Road As Analyst Shares Roadmap To $200,000 Master Kenobi further remarked that the Bitcoin price replicates this 157-day sequence for the current period, then this fractal phase began on August 5, 2024, and ended yesterday. Therefore, according to the fractal, this bullish phase should begin today. The crypto analyst added that the exact duration of this bullish period cannot be determined. However, after the 157-day fractal last year, Bitcoin entered a 51-day rally.  In line with this, he asserted that if the Bitcoin price follows the same pattern this year, the rally could end on March 2, with BTC reaching $169,000 by then. Master Kenobi also went further to analyze the charts. The crypto analyst mentioned that the accompanying chart has been slightly adjusted, with trendlines now originating from the peaks reached during the cycle.  For symmetry and additional confirmation of history repeating itself, the crypto analyst remarked that it would be ideal if the Bitcoin price action closes near the trend line that aligns with the same zone from last year. Although this is not essential, he explained that such a close would strengthen the fractal’s alignment. If this scenario unfolds, Master Kenobi warned that BTC could first fall to between $88,000 and $89,000.  Meanwhile, the crypto analyst noted that the number of days in this cycle may not be identical to last year and could extend slightly longer. This would allow sufficient time for the BTC price to reach its target along both the trend line and the horizontal yellow RSI line.  BTC Bull Market Still Intact In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto affirmed that the Bitcoin price bull market is still intact. He revealed that this bullish momentum will continue as long as Bitcoin maintains a monthly close above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level.  Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade The Bitcoin price has been on a downtrend since December last year and recently crashed below $93,000.

De prijs staat nu op $0,9352 en nadert kritieke support. Handelaren maken zich zorgen over de toenemende verkoopdruk en mogelijke verdere dalingen. In dit artikel gaan we dieper in op de impact van deze whale-sell-off en de koersverwachting van Cardano. Whale verkoopt 70 miljoen ADA Donderdag, 9 januari 2024, heeft een prominente crypto-expert op X (voorheen Twitter) gepost dat crypto whales maar liefst 70 miljoen ADA-tokens hebben gedumpt. De post op X vermeldde ook dat deze enorme dump zich de afgelopen 48 uur heeft voltrokken, wat erop wijst dat de markt crash is begonnen. De impact van deze grote dump is echter al zichtbaar in de ADA-prijs, die sinds het begin van de verkoop met meer dan 20% is gedaald. Op het moment van schrijven werd ADA verhandeld op $0,9352, een daling van 14% in de afgelopen week. Met toenemende onzekerheid onder handelaren rijst de vraag of Cardano het tij kan keren of dat verdere verliezen onvermijdelijk zijn. Impact van de sell-off op Cardano De whale-activiteit heeft geleid tot een scherpe daling van de ADA-prijs, die nu kritieke support nadert. De sterke verkoopdruk heeft de marktkapitalisatie van ADA teruggebracht tot $32,87 miljard, een daling van 6,08%, wat de omvang van de marktreactie weerspiegelt. Daarnaast is de Stock-to-Flow-ratio gedaald van 291,37 naar 288,50, wat wijst op afnemend vertrouwen van investeerders, terwijl schaarste- en vraagstatistieken lager uitvallen. ADA Stock-to-Flow Ratio Bron: Santiment Ook de derivatenmarkt toont significante bearish signalen. Op Binance daalde de Funding Rate van 0,01% naar 0,0055%, wat wijst op een afname van bullish sentiment onder traders met hefboomposities. Op de DYDX-exchange daalden de Funding Rates eveneens, van 0,000334 naar 0,000057, wat de afname in markt optimisme verder benadrukt. Deze ontwikkelingen suggereren dat handelaren hun posities aanpassen aan de verhoogde volatiliteit en neerwaartse risico’s. De MVRV ratio, een maatstaf voor winstgevendheid onder houders, is gedaald van 0,92 naar 0,769. Dit geeft aan dat ADA-houders grotere verliezen ervaren naarmate de prijs blijft dalen. MVRV ratio. Bron: Santiment Deze gecombineerde metrics tonen de impact van de whale-sell-off, die handelaren en investeerders met weinig vertrouwen in ADA’s prestaties op korte termijn heeft achtergelaten. Kan Cardano herstellen? Ondanks het bearish vooruitzicht zou ADA steun kunnen vinden bij de kritieke support van $0,8335, wat een technische rebound kan triggeren. Hiervoor moeten bulls echter de verkoopdruk opvangen en vertrouwen herstellen. Als deze support niet standhoudt, loopt ADA het risico verder te dalen, wat de verliezen voor investeerders zou kunnen verergeren. Cardano koers. Bron: TradingView In conclusie hangt het herstel van Cardano sterk af van het stoppen van de verkoopactiviteit door whales en de terugkeer van kopers naar de markt. Als ADA de kritieke support vasthoudt, is een rebound mogelijk. Gezien de huidige metrics die wijzen op bearish momentum, lijkt een snel herstel op korte termijn echter uitdagend. Veelbelovende crypto’s die Cardano kunnen overtreffen Gezien het bearish vooruitzicht voor Cardano is het verstandig om alternatieve crypto te ontdekken die er beter bij liggen.

This sharp recovery following a period of uncertainty, signals renewed strength and growing investor confidence in the asset. The move above $4.9 is not just a technical milestone; it represents a pivotal moment that could set the stage for further gains as market dynamics shift in favor of the bulls. SUI’s recent resurgence has sparked optimism about the potential for new highs, with the break above $4.9 fueling increased market interest. Traders are now closely watching if the token can sustain its momentum and overcome upcoming resistance levels.  With technical indicators supporting the rally, the next few trading sessions will be pivotal in determining whether SUI can capitalize on its current momentum or face challenges at higher levels. Bullish Momentum Returns: A Closer Look At SUI’s Rebound After failing to break below the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), SUI has made an impressive bullish recovery, breaking through the significant $4.9 resistance level. This surge signals a shift in market sentiment as the bulls regain control and push the price closer to its previous high of $5.3. Related Reading: SUI Breakout Alert: Strong Momentum Puts $4.98 Key Level In Focus Its price action highlights a strong rebound, demonstrating the underlying strength and potential for continued upward movement. The 4-hour SMA, which initially acted as a support level now serves as a key reference point for future price action.  If the momentum holds and buying pressure remains robust, SUI could not only test its previous high at $5.3 but possibly surpass it, marking new milestones in its bullish trajectory. With the current strength, it is important to keep a close watch on SUI’s next steps to see whether the rally can extend further, leading to even higher price levels. Additionally, SUI’s RSI is signaling continued bullish momentum, suggesting the possibility of more price increases. As SUI climbs above $4.9, the RSI maintains its upward trajectory well away from overbought levels, which indicates that the asset has room for additional gains.  This positive RSI trend strengthens the outlook for prolonged upside movement, with the potential to revisit previous highs as long as the indicator continues to show strength and no signs of a reversal arise. Will SUI Achieve Its Next Big Breakthrough? SUI’s price continues to climb, signaling the capability for new highs if the momentum is maintained. With further gains possible, the next target might be a test of the $5.3 peak. As long as SUI stays above $4.9, the bullish outlook remains intact and a breakout looks promising. Related Reading: SUI Skyrockets: Bullish Momentum Drives Push Toward $6 However, a failure to hold above $4.9 may weaken the bullish trend, leading to a shift in sentiment and a decline to $3.9. A breach of this support could dampen the uptrend and introduce downside risks, keeping the market cautious. Featured image from LinkedIn, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Solana scende sotto il livello psicologico dei 200 dollari: opportunità di acquisto?,2025-01-10 16:25:51+00:00,"Negli ultimi tre giorni Solana ($SOL) ha subito un brusco crollo, insieme al resto del mercato. L’altcoin ha accumulato una perdita del 12% nel grafico settimanale.  Il calo è stato alimentato da una serie di dati economici positivi provenienti dagli Stati Uniti, che hanno sollevato preoccupazioni riguardo a un possibile rimbalzo dell’inflazione. Tale scenario potrebbe ritardare i piani della Federal Reserve di alleggerire la politica monetaria. Il Dipartimento del Lavoro ha infatti riportato un inaspettato incremento dei posti di lavoro disponibili a novembre, mentre un ulteriore rapporto ha mostrato una crescita nell’attività del settore dei servizi a dicembre. I dati hanno mostrato una solida crescita economica che ha spinto i rendimenti dei Treasury decennali al 4,699%, il valore più alto dal 26 aprile.  Dopo la pubblicazione, Bitcoin ha perso la soglia dei 97.000 dollari, Ethereum è scivolato sotto i 3.400 dollari e Solana ha perso la soglia dei 200 dollari. Inoltre per SOL sia avvicina una data cruciale: la scadenza per le richieste di approvazione degli Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) Spot su Solana, presentate alla Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) degli Stati Uniti. Il 23 gennaio la SEC dovrà decidere se approvare o respingere la domanda presentata da Grayscale.  Secondo Nicolai Søndergaard, analista della società di ricerca Nansen, un ETF Spot su Solana debutterà sul mercato quest’anno, l’unica domanda è quando. “La vera incognita riguarda il numero di iterazioni necessarie prima che la proposta venga approvata, come è accaduto per Bitcoin e Ethereum. Tuttavia, sono convinto che nel 2025 ci sarà sicuramente un ETF su Solana”, ha dichiarato durante un evento sul 2024 organizzato da Cointelegraph. Secondo le scommesse sulla piattaforma di Polymarket, le probabilità che un ETF di Solana spot venga approvato nel 2025 sono del 74%.   Solana: Il livello di supporto critico da tenere d’occhio è la soglia dei 175 dollari Gli analisti ritengono che i trader stiano ancora operando in modalità “presa di profitto” in vista del discorso inaugurale di Donald Trump. Subito dopo l’elezione del candidato pro-crypto, il mercato crypto ha registrato un’impennata. La capitalizzazione del mercato ha superato i 3.000 miliardi di dollari, con Bitcoin ($BTC) che ha infranto per la prima volta la soglia psicologica dei 100.000 dollari. Solana ha raggiunto un nuovo massimo storico di 264 dollari, alimentato dalla convinzione che l’amministrazione Trump possa inaugurare un’era di politiche normative favorevoli al settore crypto e stimolare una maggiore adozione degli asset da parte degli investitori tradizionali e istituzionali. La narrativa è ancora in gioco ed è per questo che alcuni analisti ritengono che questo calo sia un’opportunità. Nel frattempo, se dovesse essere approvato un ETF Spot su Solana, miliardi di dollari provenienti da investitori retail e istituzionali potrebbero affluire verso il nuovo fondo e contribuire a spingere al rialzo l’altcoin. Per ora, l’ultimo movimento di Solana ha parzialmente annullato il breakout rialzista di un modello a bandiera che si è sviluppato nell’ultimo mese e mezzo. Il recente calo di tre giorni ha riportato l’altcoin all’interno della zona di consolidamento, indebolendo così la spinta rialzista. Attualmente, la resistenza chiave da superare nei prossimi giorni è posta a 225 dollari, un livello cruciale se i compratori dovessero riprendere il controllo del mercato. Se invece la pressione di vendita dovesse persistere, il supporto principale si trova a 175 dollari. Una rottura al di sotto di questo livello potrebbe dar luogo a un forte ritracciamento, riportando l’asset sotto i livelli raggiunti dopo le elezioni. Un’inversione così decisa del trend rialzista sembra improbabile, dato che i fattori macroeconomici che hanno spinto $SOL ai nuovi massimi storici continuano a favorire una crescita solida nel medio-lungo periodo. Solaxy (SOLX), il primo layer 2 sulla blockchain di Solana Nel frattempo gli investitori stanno puntando, oltre che su Solana, anche su un nuovo progetto: Solaxy (SOLX). Si tratta del primo layer 2 sulla blockchain di Solana.  La sua prevendita ha superato ogni aspettativa, raccogliendo oltre 9 milioni di dollari.  Solaxy non è solo un nuovo progetto nel panorama crypto, ma si propone di risolvere uno dei principali problemi di Solana: la congestione della sua blockchain. Utilizzando la tecnologia Layer 2, Solaxy riesce a migliorare le prestazioni di Solana senza compromettere la sua integrità. Le transazioni vengono elaborate tramite la rete di Solaxy, mantenendo però la piena compatibilità con Solana, consentendo al sistema di operare senza intoppi anche nei periodi di maggiore attività. Inoltre, Solaxy è una soluzione multi-chain che mira a integrare e sfruttare le migliori caratteristiche sia di Solana che di Ethereum.  Il token $SOLX è disponibile anche nella funzione “Upcoming Tokens” del nuovo wallet crypto Web3 Best Wallet.  ",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,4 of the Best Meme Coins Gaining Popularity Among Influencers,2025-01-10 15:44:12+00:00,"We all know how utility and credentials make or break cryptocurrencies, but is that all there is to it? A meme coin’s market hype, including what the most popular crypto influencers are saying, can have a massive impact on its presale numbers and, ultimately, on its performance once it’s listed. The meme coin market is thriving, with a 3.52% increase in total market cap in the last 24 hours, with fantastic gains for coins like PIPPIN (+201%), RAPTOR (+396%), and SPORE (+138%). With a potential bull run coming, your best bet is to position yourself behind projects that aren’t only fundamentally strong but also have the vote of confidence from influencers and retail traders alike. Here are 4 of the best meme coins that meet that criteria. 1. Wall Steet Pepe ($WEPE) $WEPE has quickly become a highly sought-after meme coin in the crypto community, with several influencers on platforms like YouTube and X championing its mission to empower small-scale investors. Drawing inspiration from the iconic Pepe meme, this coin blends innovation with humor, delivering real value to its holders. It’s currently in presale, where it has already raised over $45M. Such remarkable success speaks for $WEPE’s growing popularity among both retail investors and crypto influencers. The commitment of $WEPE in the crypto market sets it apart. Unlike traditional crypto ecosystems dominated by whales, $WEPE equips its community members with unique training insights and alpha trading calls. Typically, these resources are reserved for institutional players. However, $WEPE has a vision to level the playing field. The “WEPE Army,” or the “Frog Army,” based on the $WEPE community, is another factor contributing to the success of the coin. Influencers have already spread the message of collaboration and empowerment, which is fueling its viral growth. With strong support from the community and innovative features, $WEPE is well-positioned as a potential 100x meme coin in 2025. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) Solaxy ($SOLX) is the meme coin revolutionizing DeFi. It has rapidly emerged as a favorite among crypto enthusiasts and influencers, thanks to its unique combination of meme culture and practical utility. $SOLX has been built as a Layer-2 solution on the Solana network and addresses persistent challenges like spam transactions and scalability. It also simplifies issues like network congestion, which makes it an outstanding choice in the meme coin ecosystem. The Solaxy presale was launched in December 2024. Since then, it has raised an impressive $9.5M, which showcases the strong confidence among investors. The current price of $0.001596 is an attractive entry point for early investors, considering that prices are expected to increase within the next 24 hours. The innovative tokenomics of $SOLX allocates 25% of its supply to rewards, 30% to development, and 10% to liquidity pools. $SOLX is also gaining traction for its seamless integration with DeFi platforms. This meme coin makes transactions faster and more effective, providing a user-friendly solution for the expanding DeFi market. Currently, 2.8B $SOLX tokens are locked in staking rewards. This demonstrates the strong trust in its community and active participation. Influencers are excited about the robust ecosystem of $SOLX and its practical applications. This defines its potential for exponential growth in 2025, making it one of the best crypto presales to join in 2025. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) $FLOCK is another meme coin gaining a lot of traction among influencers due to its unique vote-to-earn mechanism. All token holders, irrespective of the size of their holdings, can vote on important decisions to decide the future of the project. The more you participate, the more $FLOCK tokens you earn. Simply put, it’s the token holders who get to decide the future of the project in a purely democratic way. Moreover, the platform has also been audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, ensuring that $FLOCK is 100% legit and safe. The project has already raised more than $9M in presales, with one $FLOCK currently priced at $0.006616. However, note that this price may increase as the presale is expected to end around 23 January. The token already has a strong following on X, with close to 30K followers, indicating both influencers’ and investors’ interest in the project. 4. SPX6900 ($SPX) SPX6900 ($SPX) is out of its presale stage and is currently trading live. It had a good bull run up until December, after which it went into consolidation. However, the year ended on a positive note for the token as it breached the $1 mark. The first week of January 2025 was particularly excellent, as it soared more than 80% in a single week and hit an all-time high with a $1.44B market cap. Currently, the coin is trading at around $1.25-$1.35, with a total market cap of $1.18B. Analysts believe it’s still early days for the coin, and it has a lot of potential in the next few months, with the price expected to cross the $2 mark. If you’re a long-term investor and can hold the coin for 3-5 years, you can expect the price to reach somewhere between $6-$10. It’s no wonder SPX6900 has become a rage among influencers and crypto enthusiasts. It has around 70K followers on X and over 16K subscribers on its Telegram. Conclusion With all the chatter around meme coins and their potential for massive returns, it’s important to stick to the basics of investing, which is to do your own research and put your money into projects that offer distinct advantages over the others in their segment. We also recommend not getting overwhelmed by a particular coin’s market hype or taking a crypto influencer’s word for it. Additionally, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your due diligence.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Analyst Highlights Strong Signals,2025-01-10 15:30:40+00:00,"Although the cryptocurrency sector is notoriously unstable, several analysts see hopeful signs for XRP. The Great Mattsby, a seasoned market analyst, is one of those who predict a significant gain in XRP. His most recent analysis focuses on a good chart pattern that indicates a possible rise to $9. Related Reading: Bitcoin As The New S&P 500 Of Our Time? This CEO Thinks So XRP Stability In The Face Of Market Fluctuations The current state of XRP is of great interest to the cryptocurrency community. Regardless, despite the market’s recent troubles, the digital asset has remained relatively robust. The price of XRP is $2.31 as of January 10, 2025, down 0.43% from the previous day. The fact that it has been able to maintain its position above critical support levels is encouraging for investors, according to The Great Mattsby. $XRP is so damn bullish that its one of the last coins that hasnt even touched the daily Ichimoku cloud yet.

This can only mean 1 thing. $XRP to $9 soon pic.twitter.com/3EWZUmGSXJ — The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) January 8, 2025 It’s important to note that XRP has not dropped below the daily Ichimoku Cloud. According to this technical sign, which analysts often use to find levels of support and resistance, XRP’s momentum has not changed. Even though there are negative trends, it has stayed on the same path. This could mean that better times are coming. Optimism Incited By Bullish Chart Patterns The Great Mattsby claims that a bullish reversal pattern is emerging in the price charts of XRP, which he feels has the ability to propel the cryptocurrency to new highs. Traders and investors alike are frequently delighted by these patterns, which typically indicate a shift from downward to upward trends. Related Reading: Funding Rates Down: Is Bitcoin Heading For A $90K Correction? He believes that the XRP chart shows a strong foundation for a price breakout, with the potential to reach $9 in the medium to long term. Mattsby concedes that his optimism is backed by past positive performance and current market signals, despite the fact that this outlook may sound overly ambitious. XRP market cap currently at $6.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Potential Strength The future direction of XRP will likely hinge on factors such as regulatory clarity, partnerships, and market sentiment. While some may see uncertainty, analysts like Mattsby see potential strength. Markets for cryptocurrencies are quite erratic, hence unanticipated developments can ruin even the most accurate forecasts. This is why The Great Mattsby and other analysts caution even with XRP’s bright potential. Investors should examine both technical analysis and more general market research including fundamental updates and macroeconomic trends if they are to really grasp XRP’s potential.

Fast forward some months of research and work I'm very close to launching my project. I really like this Reddit Solana community and I'm excited to share my dApp with you all as soon as I launch it.

Every time I see a so called CTO it’s the same story. “We got rugged but now want to keep the meme coin going because we build a community.” Funny how a community was built in days and how all the accounts seem new.

First of all I‘m honest and also benefit from this but you guys need to understand how fucked up this space is and why so many loose not less than everything.

Despite all the rugpullers or SOL influencers who are dumping on you, I lately had some personal contact to one of the biggest what you would call „insider“ sheme. The numbers are shocking and while most traders know aboit them I still think it‘s important to talk about this.

So these guys are working with 50+ devs who all know how to market a coin. They change their wallets for copytraders and just so nobody knows this project will be successful.
After the launch these guys gets onboard to give them a huge launch volume which usually leads the coins to some front pages.
Depending on the coin and market they cash out at 10-100x on every single on of them and then change wallets again.

This sheme just gets crazier everyday because they get more money to advertise all of these and are dumping on the whole community",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

88, 000 % increase in a day. ( an example). Then 6 hrs says 43%, and 1 hour says-3.2%.

Then when I go to check the price of the coin , the 24 hour increase is 7%. See such examples of this all the time.

The percentage increases are falsehoods to get your attention?

Reddit,solana,Educational Blog Post | Solana Token Accounts Made Simple: Why Should You Close Them? (Written by RayBot intern),2025-01-09 20:06:53,"**Source:** [https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9](https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9)

On Solana, associated token accounts (ATAs) are essential for managing tokens. But what happens when you no longer need a specific token account? That’s where the “close token account” transaction comes in. Let’s explore why and how you might close an ATA, and the benefits of doing so.

[https:\/\/t.me\/ray\_magenta\_bot](https://preview.redd.it/mrlvvwoqy0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8063f79b43829bc5d71e8607c2639023379f0acb)

# What Does It Mean to Close an Associated Token Account?

Closing an associated token account is like cleaning out a locker at the end of the school year. Once you’re done using it — say, you’ve sold all the tokens — you can “close” the account. This deletes the account and refunds the rent (SOL) used to maintain it.

>

# Why Close an ATA?

There are a few key reasons you might want to close an associated token account:

1. **You No Longer Need It:** If you’ve sol all the tokens and don’t plan to use that token again, closing the account cleans up your wallet.
2. **Save on Rent Costs: Each account you maintain uses a bit of SOL. By closing unused accounts, you can reclaim those funds.**

# How to Close an ATA

There are many tools that can help you close ATA accounts. Here’s how it works:

1. **Ensure the Account Is Empty:** Before closing an account, make sure it has a balance of 0. You can do this by transferring or selling any remaining tokens to another wallet or account.
2. **Use a Cleanup Tool:** Use one of the well-established tools to close your accounts. For instance, go to [Sol Incinerator](https://sol-incinerator.com/#/) (one of the most popular tools for wallet cleanups) and select “CLEANUP.” It will display all your vacant accounts. There are other tools offering the same functionality — do your own research (DYOR).

The “close token account” transaction is a simple yet powerful tool for optimizing your wallet on Solana. By closing unused accounts, you save money, keep your wallet organized, and contribute to the overall health of the network. Whether you’re a casual user or a developer, understanding and utilizing this feature can make a big difference in your Solana experience.

So next time you spot an empty token account in your wallet, consider closing it — your SOL balance will thank you!

https://preview.redd.it/b6u67k5n01ce1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a96b9488bb6a1f202aa4bc1c546346abb9bb3fab

We launched [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) in early 2024 with the goal of empowering developers to compete, experiment, and build products across a broad spectrum of crypto use cases through our online hackathons. In partnership with the Solana Foundation and numerous ecosystem organizations, we’ve built the largest hackathons in crypto and helped accelerate the rapid growth of Solana’s startup ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/f6354joq01ce1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf37ffc7659f232fb0275d195c444222b7040756

Following each major Solana hackathon ([Renaissance](https://www.colosseum.org/renaissance?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Radar](https://www.colosseum.org/radar?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), we accepted two accelerator batches each with 10+ winning teams. And to date, we’ve made pre-seed investments in 20+ startups. Reviewing thousands of hackathon submissions and working with talented founders in our accelerator program has given us an up close view of crypto's rapidly emerging markets. As the year comes to a close, we’re excited to share our perspective on 12 high-growth verticals where we saw exciting development in 2024, and that we believe will continue to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. In addition, we highlight the hackathon winners and teams we’ve backed who we believe are creating the markets that will drive each category forward.

*Note: Many of the projects mentioned below are currently on devnet, with mainnet deployments expected in Q1 and Q2 2025.*

**Non-Sovereign SoV Assets**

Over the past decade, Bitcoin has proven that a non-sovereign store-of-value (SoV) asset can gain global acceptance and secure a core position within the global financial system. While Bitcoin’s incredible success validated the concept, we believe it also opened the door for additional digital gold-like assets to reach escape velocity and meaningful liquidity in the coming years.

[Ore](https://x.com/OREsupply?ref=blog.colosseum.org) stands out as the most promising non-sovereign asset tailored specifically for onchain ecosystems. Strong community support, thoughtful economic design, and increased liquidity—fueled by “Boosts” on key trading pairs—[positioned Ore well in 2024](https://x.com/mattytay/status/1870887900663169059?ref=blog.colosseum.org). We’re excited to see the core team use these structural advantages to build new products that further its adoption in the broader onchain economy.

**Futarchy**

DAOs have long struggled with governance, often relying on 1-token-1-vote structures that can stifle progress, resulting in a waste of both human and treasury capital. MetaDAO offers a transformative “[futarchy as a service](https://metadao.fi/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)” framework, enabling organizations to make decisions through markets rather than traditional voting mechanisms.

[MetaDAO](https://x.com/MetaDAOProject?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is already integrated into leading projects like Drift and Jito. We believe futarchy will continue to solidify itself as the default governance module in the Solana ecosystem (and crypto more broadly) in 2025—one that overcomes entrenched governance challenges and accelerates dynamic decision-making.

**Decentralized Stablecoins**

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT have achieved widespread adoption, and crypto-native products such as Ethena are also on the rise. However, existing stablecoin implementations often sacrifice censorship resistance, capital efficiency, or both.

A new wave of experimentation is underway, with the aim of creating stablecoins that offer robust stability while also delivering more decentralization, transparency, and higher yield potential. [Reflect](https://x.com/ReflectCX?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Hylo](https://x.com/hylo_so?ref=blog.colosseum.org) represent two of the most promising protocols leading the decentralized stablecoin renaissance in 2025.

**Crypto’s Growth Stack**

As consumer-facing products begin to dominate venture funding in the Solana ecosystem, the need for sophisticated growth tools will increase in lockstep. Just as Web2 startups have grown up around powerful analytics and marketing tools, Web3 builders are now developing their own data-driven growth engines to meet their unique needs.

[Torque](https://x.com/torqueprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is one such product, providing a powerful onchain-native growth platform, enabling just-in-time user rewards based on a wide variety of behaviors. Prominent teams like Tensor and Metaplex already use Torque for targeted growth campaigns. Meanwhile [AdX](https://x.com/AdXso_?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team in our latest accelerator cohort, is building a decentralized ad exchange, granting both Web 2 and Web 3 projects direct access to effective distribution channels.

**High-performance Clients**

Currently, Solana’s network relies on two main node clients: Anza’s Agave and Jump’s Firedancer, the latter of which hasn’t been fully deployed yet. The Firedancer team has taken on the ambitious (and critical) effort of building a new client from the ground up, with a focus on high-performance. While we believe this will be a successful effort over the coming years, we also believe there are sustainable opportunities for monetizing more tightly-scoped validator improvements even sooner. 

[Rakurai](https://x.com/Rakurai_io?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team of experienced engineers from Apple and high-frequency trading, are capitalizing on one such opportunity. Building on upcoming Agave releases, their validator client will integrate an optimized transaction scheduler that has benchmarked at up to 5x the current block rewards and yield boosts of over 30% compared to existing clients. We anticipate a continued increase in competition amongst validator operators, leading to better network performance for apps and users in the years to come.

**Crypto Developer Tooling**

As crypto matures, development teams require increasingly advanced tooling to secure, monitor, and scale their products. In traditional tech, tools like HashiCorp’s Terraform made cloud infrastructure management far simpler and more reliable for engineers. In crypto, [Txtx](https://x.com/txtxrun?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is poised to offer similarly transformative infrastructure—improving security, reliability, and reproducibility of workflows involving onchain programs/smart contracts.

For monitoring and rapid bug resolution, [Tokamai](https://x.com/gotokamai?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has also emerged as a crypto-native equivalent to Sentry, empowering developers to maintain application reliability through every layer of the stack.

**Onchain Yield**

While DeFi has introduced overcollateralized lending, capital-efficient yield remains elusive. The next phase of DeFi will bring more sophisticated yield markets onchain, enabled through true prime brokerage-like functionality and liquid staking fundamentals.

[Asgard](https://x.com/asgardfi?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is laying this groundwork by building a suite of DeFi protocols, including a spot margin aggregator and credit synthesizer. [Pye](https://x.com/pyefinance?ref=blog.colosseum.org), another hackathon winner, is creating a marketplace that allows stakers to tokenize and forward-sell their staking yield—further extending the frontier of DeFi 2.0.

The final team we backed in this vertical is [Watt](https://x.com/wattprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is building a volatility farming protocol utilizing market arbitrage to generate real yield for users and foster liquidity for the ecosystem as a whole.

**Private DeFi Infrastructure**

Transparency is a defining feature of DeFi, yet certain market participants prefer selective privacy. PayPal’s integration of confidential transactions using token extensions for its PYUSD stablecoin highlights a growing demand for privacy-enhanced financial infrastructure.

We believe this foreshadows in a new era of embedded privacy primitives for DeFi. [Darklake](https://x.com/darklakefi?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a recent hackathon standout, employs zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy-first dark pool trading platform.

**Sports Markets**

Sports are rapidly financializing: stadiums are integrating casinos, online betting is thriving, and college athletes are now receiving substantial compensation. Crypto is poised to expand and democratize these markets—enabling direct ownership, unique betting models, and new forms of engagement.

In our newest accelerator cohort, [AlphaFC](https://x.com/alphafcxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is pioneering the tokenization of sports fandom through real ownership of an English football club, and [Pregame](https://x.com/pregame_hq?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is building a new platform for direct p2p sports betting. We're excited to watch both of these endeavors expand crypto’s role in the sports economy.

**Virtual Infrastructure Networks**

DeVINs (Decentralized Virtual Infrastructure Networks) gained momentum in 2024 and we continue to see top founder talent launch a diversity of products in the space.

[BlockMesh](https://x.com/blockmesh_xyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) empowers users to earn passive income by leveraging their unused bandwidth, and is well on their way to building a strong network with over 500,000 extension downloads.  Meanwhile, [MeshMap](https://x.com/meshmapxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is focused on building a 3D AR mapping network. Although mainstream AR/VR adoption is still in its infancy, we anticipate accelerated growth in these areas over the next 1-2 years. Finally, we also backed [DBunker](https://x.com/Dbunker_Network?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is an aggregator and marketplace giving users the ability to participate across many DeVINs.

**Energy Markets**

Rising global energy demand and increasing climate pressures create volatility and opportunity. Southeast Asia, in particular, has seen high demand for innovative solutions to support a growing population with an aging energy grid. We’ve backed 2 India-based teams who are building novel token-incentivized infrastructure to serve this demand.

[DeCharge](https://x.com/DeCharge__?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has deployed over 150 EV charging stations within just a few months, and is expanding to the U.S. in Q1 2025, and [GreenkWh](https://x.com/GreenKWh?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is using battery packs to coordinate off-grid energy—both projects exemplify how crypto can reshape global energy infrastructure.

**Social Markets**

After a 2024 boom in memecoins, founders are now exploring deeper integrations of social media, token issuance, and gaming. The following teams are exploring use cases across a spectrum of community engagement to gamified token economies:

* [Banger](https://x.com/bangerdotlol?ref=blog.colosseum.org): An app that enables users to buy and sell “tweet tokens,” Curators to profit from high-volume tweet markets, and Creators to earn for their viral posts.
* [Peek](https://x.com/peekdotcyou?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A platform that leverages liquid crypto markets to gamify TikTok videos and content.
* [Supersize](https://x.com/supersizegg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A Mini-clip style gaming platform building an onchain PVP game where token communities wager and compete for dominance to become the largest “blob” on the map.
* [Monsters](https://x.com/monsdotgg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A new game for memecoin communities, blending Pokémon-inspired mechanics with high-stakes betting.
* [Teamplay](https://x.com/teamplay_games?ref=blog.colosseum.org) (with Midcurve): A platform for creators to host private gaming sessions and contests, tightening community engagement and opening new revenue streams through a token-enhancing toolkit.

**Looking Ahead**

As we prepare to run more hackathons for the Solana ecosystem in 2025, we’re eager to learn from the next generation of founders and support the creation of novel crypto markets. One emerging force we’re closely examining is AI weaving its way into crypto landscape. While we don’t view AI as a standalone use case, we do see it as a transformative layer that will enhance all verticals.

# 🚀 Investments and Themes for 2025

Colosseum launched in early 2024 to help developers compete and experiment across a wide spectrum of Solana-based products through online hackathons. 

Since then, the team has reviewed thousands of submissions, accepted multiple cohorts into its accelerator, and made pre-seed investments in more than 20 promising startups. 

Drawing on that hands-on experience, Colosseum has identified 12 high-growth verticals that are set to shape the Solana and broader crypto landscape in 2025, each one addressing real-world challenges.

A key theme running through all twelve verticals is a renewed focus on real-world utility and sophisticated market design. 

Whether it’s a sports fan token that unlocks new ways to engage with your favorite team, or a next-gen aggregator that forward-sells staked yield, these protocols aim to bring deep liquidity, better user experiences, and new revenue streams on-chain. 

And while Colosseum doesn’t see AI as its own siloed vertical, the team expects AI to become an indispensable layer across each of these categories by streamlining data insights, risk management, and user onboarding in ways we haven’t even imagined yet.

For developers and builders looking to stay ahead, these areas offer opportunities to create new markets and leverage existing ones. Expect these verticals to play an outsized role as we move into 2025 and beyond.

# ➰ Accounts Lattice Hash

Solana developers have introduced a proposal to tackle the [state growth problem](https://x.com/aeyakovenko/status/1789009684378382404?ref=blog.colosseum.org) by implementing a lattice-based system known as the Accounts Lattice Hash. 

According to the proposal ([SIMD-215](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0215-accounts-lattice-hash.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), ""the main goal is to scale Solana to billions of accounts and compute a ‘hash of all accounts’ in practical time and space.” 

One of the core changes involves homomorphic hashing, a method that verifies only the accounts that have changed, rather than reprocessing every account on the network. 

>Think of it like cleaning a house. Instead of scrubbing every single room every day, you only tidy up the spaces that got messy.  
\~ Republik Labs

At the end of each epoch, Solana’s Epoch Accounts Hash mechanism must rehash all accounts. As the size of Solana state grows, this process becomes increasingly resource-intensive.

In contrast, the lattice-based method accumulates individual account hashes directly and updates only the accounts that have changed. 

By eliminating the need for full recalculations, the approach will reduce computational overhead. This upgrade also aims to preserve the network’s existing security level, offering a path to global scale without sacrificing safety.

If the community approves this improvement, Solana’s infrastructure could set a new benchmark for blockchain scalability.

[**New Solana proposal aims to fix scalability issues with ‘lattice’ system**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-solana-proposal-fix-scalability-issues-lattice-hashing-system?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🛡️ Quantum Resistant Winternitz Vault

Google’s quantum computing project [Willow](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) made headlines recently and raised concerns in the crypto world. 

Blockchains use cryptographic systems built on mathematical problems that quantum computers could solve much faster, ultimately making it possible to reverse-engineer private keys from public keys.

While we're still a long way off from that ever happening, Solana developer Dean Little has introduced the Solana Winternitz Vault, an optional quantum-resistant vault that leverages hash-based signature technology.

The Solana Winternitz Vault is essentially a specialized account system that uses hash-based signatures instead of traditional elliptic curve cryptography. 

The idea is simple: Each time a user makes a transaction, a new private key is generated and revealed, minimizing the chance of a quantum computer exploiting previously exposed public keys. 

Under the hood, it leverages Winternitz One-Time Signatures (W-OTS) along with a Merkle root structure for added security and tamper-proof verification.

While the vault is an entirely optional feature, its hash-based signature approach shows an awareness of quantum threats and a commitment to protecting user funds as quantum computing continues to advance.

[**Solana can be quantum-resistant today, here’s how**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solana-can-be-quantum-resistant-today-heres-how-614544fbccd8?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🗳️ Solana Founder Survey

Lightspeed polled 42 anonymous Solana founders on a variety of topics in the Solana space. 

Many founders remain bullish on Solana’s trajectory and culture, even saying if Solana didn’t exist, they wouldn’t be in crypto at all. 

However, among those open to other ecosystems, Base and Sui ranked as the most appealing. 

Founders also shared concerns about MEV on Solana, noting it drives up costs and makes transaction ordering more complex.

Memecoins got a “mostly good” label from respondents where AI agents were called “overrated” and seen by some as mostly hype. 

On the infrastructure side, founders said the demand for blockspace is growing fast, and they want bigger blocks to keep fees manageable.

Overall, founder sentiment highlights excitement about the future of Solana, a desire to fend off rising MEV concerns, and a readiness to innovate with new use cases.

https://reddit.com/link/1hxlesq/video/5ww2c88hu0ce1/player

>**2/** 🙏 Firstly, a massive shoutout to our incredible angels: Solana founders [@aeyakovenko](https://x.com/aeyakovenko), [@rajgokal](https://x.com/rajgokal), fmr Coinbase CTO [@balajis](https://x.com/balajis), along with [@BigBrainVC](https://x.com/BigBrainVC), [@MonkeDAO](https://x.com/MonkeDAO), [@santiagoroel](https://x.com/santiagoroel), [@akshaybd](https://x.com/akshaybd), [@tamgros](https://x.com/tamgros), [@Austin\_Federa](https://x.com/Austin_Federa), [@kashdhanda](https://x.com/kashdhanda), [@TheOnlyNom](https://x.com/TheOnlyNom), [@R89Capital](https://x.com/R89Capital) to name a few❤️



>**3/** The Challenge: How do we onramp “the next billion users” to stablecoins if they live in countries where cash is still king?

https://preview.redd.it/iqgkjfrnu0ce1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa827818d26ff9774736ee751229742fc138015b

>**4/** 💡 The Solution: Leveraging existing “agent banking” networks

>• Mobile money agents form a hidden financial superhighway spanning all developing countries

>• Globally, 18M agents process $560B cash over the counter every year

>• These agents normally process cash for people’s bill payments, mobile topups, money transfers, remittances, etc



>**5/** 📈 Scaling our own agent network

>• DePIN incentive mechanisms allow us to programmatically scale token rewards by neighborhood, city and country

>• Early agents earn higher rewards, accelerating critical mass as we launch new markets

>• QR stands act as miniature billboards, sparking curiosity for digital dollars from all the foot traffic

>  
**6/** 📈 Massive untapped demand

>• DePIN platforms typically have trouble scaling demand side

>• However, emerging markets have massive unmet demand for dollars due to their scarcity through traditional channels.

>• People often pay 5-10% premiums to get their hands on dollars just to stuff them under their mattress or hide them in the closet.

>• ZAR democratizes access to the world’s strongest currency through easy access to stablecoins



>**7/** 🔍 How ZAR works: 

>1. Find nearby agent with the best fx rate

>2. Scan QR to trade 

>3. Hand over cash 

>4. Receive digital dollars instantly



>**8/** 🌐 Cash onramp infrastructure for all  

>• Our SDK enables any web3 app to integrate ZAR’s onramp/offramp 

>• Think of us like a MoonPay, but for cash onramping 

>• Building the Western Union/Moneygram of Web3

Reddit,solana,On how to build a wallet watcher,2025-01-09 02:43:42,"Every game in the world is won by knowing something the other players don’t. Crypto is no different. With the blockchain being public your job is to either be the winner with your own ideas or find the sharp plays made by the sharp accounts. Finding sharp accounts is still on you. But I’m here to share some insight into how to monitor these accounts with automation.

I’ve done a few YouTube videos sharing what I’ve learned about monitoring Solana transactions and I’ve done one about this topic. But with this subreddit’s understandable change to move away from links and self promotion I’ll be sharing this information in text format. 

This is just one way, but I think this is the fastest way to spin up a wallet watcher. The premise is that we can leverage a service provided by a company called Helius to monitor the transactions and alert an application we spin up with new updates from a wallet or account. Helius is one of the most reputable services to interact easily with Solana. Their free tier is generous and they offer a service that utilizes Webhooks, meaning that when Helius detects an account made a transaction, it will alert our application. Our application has to be hosted to receive webhooks. For my own use I am using Cloudflare Workers. It also has a generous free tier. But you can find hundreds of options for this part. 

I kept my tracker simple, when Cloudflare/the app receives the webhooks, it parses out the transaction and I have mine alert me via Telegram. 

That’s pretty much it. Helius to a quick Cloudflare Worker to Telegram. All you need to get started. I’ll try and update the post with the code later without a link for safety. But if you have any questions, my DMs are open. Best wishes ",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,solana,"Are meme coins quite literally only a giant pyramid scheme, please explain if not
",2025-01-08 16:11:37,"Edit: perhaps not a ‘pyramid scheme’ but rather MLM marketing 

I was initially thinking meme coins have value to them defined by the strength of the community and what we see today is a decentralization of marketing — if that makes sense.

For example, useless companies/brands are being sold for millions only due to the large audience it has accumulated. Now only a few at the top profit and everyone else gives all their money to them.

With meme coins (ideally speaking) everyone gets a stake of the profit sharing. No one cares about celebrities anymore — so whatever money they could have extracted from us we decided to just form our own community with it and we all have a chance of building together. Also, memes can be viewed as leverage to buy btc (which also implies the coin will have a short lifespan from an individual 'investor')

Of course, I’m leaving out the rug pulling as I’m talking of the what meme coins are supposed to be imo and not what inevitably happens to 99% of coins. But to answer the rug pulling, this is a byproduct of minimal regulations. As the sector grows and some regulation takes place, meme money will converge to the best memes that have proven its proof of concept.

Cool. But here’s where I’m at right now:

1. Memes have almost no intrinsic value
2. People buy a meme for its growth
3. Memes are not a store of value
4. Memes run on another crypto’s blockchain

These equate to the same very thick ceiling for all memes. Once a meme hits a certain MC, it’s basically a wrap for the meme. People don’t see it having quick growth anymore, it’s not a store of value, what if it grew so much you need to spend 1 SOL just to get a fraction of a meme, hey it’s dipping and there actually is not intrinsic value to any of this —> dump

So far, going long on any memecoin after initial hype almost always results in failure. Long as in 5yrs+. Doge is doing ight (although I’m sure most got burned) but only because of Elon.

So, given the above how can meme coins not be a giant pyramid scheme? I’m not even talking about rug pulling here. After an its growth, you have to cash out because memes don’t store value. They only Caveat I see is no one knows when it stops growing — but at the moment mc is a huge indicator.

My only optimistic conclusion so far is Solana just has to explode to increase the ceiling of these coins, and there needs to be a huge barrier for minting new memes thus other coins will have long term value. And I think memes are going to be around because gambling hasn’t gone anywhere.

My question is though, is a ‘strong community’ actually enough to support a meme coin, long term? People want to buy a meme, forget about it, come back 5yrs later and still be up.

* UK-based fintech firm Revolut became the first banking data publisher to join the multi-chain Pyth Network.
* Revolut will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth price feeds, allowing DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

Crypto-friendly fintech firm Revolut has become the first banking data publisher to join the Pyth Network.

 — a provider of real-time market data for onchain applications.

Revolut, which boasts over 45 million users across 200 countries, will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth’s price feeds, enabling DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

“Our partnership with Pyth is an important milestone in Revolut's journey to modernize finance,” Revolut Global Business Head of Crypto Mazen Eljundi said. “By working with Pyth to provide our reliable market data to applications, Revolut can influence digital economies by ensuring developers and users have access to the precise, real-time information they need.”

As a Pyth oracle network publisher, the digital banking platform will help secure the operations of hundreds of dapps, which can now access over 500 real-time feeds for digital and traditional assets, responsible for more than $1 trillion in total traded volume during 2024, according to a statement shared with The Block.

Other Pyth data publishers include Amber Group, Binance, Bitstamp, Bybit, Cboe, Cumberland DRW, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, Jane Street, OKX, Raydium and Wintermute.

“Pyth’s collaboration with Revolut is part of a larger trend we’re seeing, where traditional banking institutions, trusted by millions of customers globally, are recognizing the value of decentralized finance and digital assets,” Michael Cahill, CEO and co-founder of Douro Labs, core contributor to the Pyth Network, said. “Together, we are driving the future of finance, where transparent and reliable data empowers the next generation of financial applications.”

Originally designed for the Solana blockchain, Pyth Network now operates across more than 80 blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Aptos and Sui, providing real-time market data for cryptocurrencies, equities, FX and commodities.

# Revolut’s expanding crypto initiatives

In May 2024, the fintech firm launched a standalone crypto trading platform, Revolut X, in the UK, subsequently [expanding](https://www.theblock.co/post/326175/revolut-expands-crypto-exchange-30-markets) to 30 European countries in November. In September, Revolut was also [reported to be](https://www.theblock.co/post/317166/uk-fintech-firm-revolut-intends-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin-report) in the process of launching its own stablecoin.

Revolut [secured](https://www.theblock.co/post/307389/crypto-friendly-fintech-revolut-secures-banking-license-from-uk-financial-regulator) a banking license from the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority in July 2024, after a three-year application process. Obtaining a UK banking license is notoriously difficult due to the stringent regulatory and compliance requirements imposed by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority.

For several decades, the UK banking sector was dominated by large, established institutions, and no new banking licenses were granted until Metro Bank in 2010. The Bank of Dave campaign following the 2008 financial crisis highlighted the challenges of entering the sector, and subsequent reforms helped pave the way for several other new banks, including Monzo and Starling, which disrupted the market.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,solana,Had to use all my Solana funds to pay a vet bill,2025-01-07 22:26:53,"My Dog (16 months) has been biting at his backside and back legs for the last almost two weeks. For a while it just looked like he was chasing his tail so I didn't think much of it but over time he was doing it more and more and then he would start chewing on his back legs while whining so I ended up to him to the vet and it turns out he had parasites (most likely from eating something off the ground outside)

The bill ended up being almost $300 and my work always slows down to a crawl in the beginning months of the year so I had to use whatever I had in my solana chain which was around $200 to help cover the cost. I'm happy I was able to get my dog the help he needed but I'm also devastated that my crypto is gone.

This is my first time getting into crypto and this setback just makes me think that this isn't for me. Has anyone else struggled from not using their crypto so it can actually grow? And if so how did you come back from losing it all?",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,solana,Solana team or insider setting up trade bots raking in millions if not billions,2025-01-08 00:29:53,I’ve come to the conclusion that solana chain company or an insider has thousands of MEV trade bots scamming people out of millions if not billions. There are so many of these bots constantly trading making millions of profit within a month and they move faster than any other bot program you can think of.. meaning they have direct access to the data hub/ nodes as possible. I may have to hang my hat on this memecoin trend.. haven’t fully decided. Not as bullish as I once was. This will all come crashing down at some point.,2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734
Reddit,solana,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-07 13:22:55,"Hey fam, happy new year. This was popular on r/Solidity, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT:*** *The deadline to apply was just extended from to January 11th!*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

LMK if you have any questions, the team or I can try to give more info.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,solana,Re: looking for assistance coding flash loan arbitrage bot,2025-01-08 06:50:51,"Posted last week and got scammed. Looking for a couple of people to join a team to test and develop a flash loan arbitrage bot for sol and SPL tokens on raydium orca serum and jupyter. I understand arbitrage but need some assistance with the more technical aspects of coding the bot. Looking forward to learning a lot on my own and contributing what I can to the project. All code will be shared in a private github repo so that the developers can use it on their own machines or servers once it is working and tested. No telegram. I will host a discord server or something else that cannot be taken down. Everyone can fork the repo as long as it remains private and all forks are private when we are finished. No one will be asked to contribute money at any time. Everyone will work on either planning, logic, coding, or optimization. Your payment is the finished project which only the small dev team will have access to. My knowledge is limited so don't be intimidated, just ready to learn and contribute what you can. There are no time constraints. It will be done when it is as profitable as we can practically make it. Again, no money or crypto will be exchanged between any members of the dev team. Wsl, debian based hyperv or other vm, or bare metal Linux will be required. Knowledge on Linux is not required as it is easy to learn for what we are trying to do. No scammers allowed. Got burned and not letting it happen again. Leave helpful comments with suggestions for finding a team or if you are interested in joining the team. Let's try to make some passive income and learn a little along the way. ",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

I connected the same wallet to radium on my laptop and the transaction was not on my history but only on my phone. I have linked a photo below of what it looks like.

The USDC from my account is gone but the grass tokens are nowhere to be found.

Reddit,solana,Solana's SIMD-215 Proposal: A Major Step Toward Blockchain Scalability and Quantum Resistance,2025-01-07 16:19:23,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my thoughts on an exciting development I came across in the blockchain space: Solana's SIMD-215 proposal. This update aims to solve some of the most significant challenges in blockchain scalability.

At its core, SIMD-215 introduces Solana's Accounts Lattice Hash system, which addresses inefficient account state updates. By using homomorphic hashing, the network only updates what’s changed, instead of recalculating the entire state from scratch. This approach allows for:

Improved efficiency 👍

The ability to support billions of accounts 😳

Enhanced security, with 128-bit encryption and quantum resistance

What stands out to me is not only how Solana is solving current scalability issues, but also how it's preparing for future threats, like quantum computing. This could be a game-changer in making blockchain networks more secure and scalable for widespread adoption.

What do you all think about this approach? Do you believe scalability is the key to blockchain reaching mainstream adoption, or are there other factors at play?

Reddit,solana,Rust (Now Go) Trading Platform from Scratch - Update 3,2025-01-07 19:12:57,"The second update:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust\_trading\_platform\_from\_scratch\_update\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust_trading_platform_from_scratch_update_2/)

Moving these posts over to here instead of r/algotrading  because I think there are some folks here who could benefit from it.

I've been building an algotrading and fraud detection/chain analysis system in Rust for the last several months. Despite loving Rust, I immediately started running into some significant issues with the language and this application.

**the issues**

Rust is very good. It's very fast, incredibly memory efficient, and has lots of libraries required to build onchain. Solana is built on it, obviously.

The issue that Rust has is working with unstructured data, or data whose structure is pretty difficult to define. I wanted to build out a custom parser for transactions, and the going was incredibly slow and painful. Between parsing bytes and converting them to different data types to dealing with weird memory footguns, it became so annoying to write that I genuinely left the project alone for a week or two.

Everyone on r/algotrading was recommending Golang. I'd written some serverless lambda applications in Golang, and really liked it. It's like taking the ease of use of Python and adding the speed and power of Rust or C. Yes, it's garbage collected and therefore probably a wee bit slower than Rust, but the difference was basically ""not finish a very fast solution in Rust"" or ""finish a fairly fast solution in Golang"" and I've seen how dumb a lot of ya'll are, I'm not going to need breakneck speed to win in this market and do a lot of the analytical work I'm trying to do. I also have a vision of a system where Golang does all the data fetching and structuring and Rust does all of the data analytics, but that's long down the road.

**golang rules**

I started the Golang conversion yesterday, and I'm already close to achieving relative parity with my Rust codebase. I also get to use Raylib for data visualization, which seems to be much more mature than Bevy, the game engine I was using in Rust.

**lesson: dev speed isn't just about how quickly you can get something out there**

The dev speed in Rust was so bad that I literally found myself not wanting to work on the project. I spent ages just figuring out how to make the memory management work instead of adding features. I still believe Rust is a fantastic language, but I don't think I'm going to go back to it for projects that require a lot of unstructured data parsing. I just develop better software, faster, using Go right now.

**the overall plan**

I'm going to get the basics of wallet visualization and management working first and then work on the trading engine. I've got a shared RPC node with a ton of available bandwidth, so I've got a lot of leeway to test and gather data with.

After that, I'm going to build out the data vis layer at the same time as the trading engine. I think it'll be helpful to be able to visualize other wallets and their strategies while I develop my own, and I have a few wallets I want to look into.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,ethereum,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-09 13:11:10,"Hey folks, happy new year. This was popular on r/ethdev, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT***\*: They just extended the application deadline to January 11th, so I’d apply ASAP if interested\*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

For this reason, today the integration of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) in staking offers a more resilient and decentralized alternative that addresses concerns about the deficiencies in traditional centralized staking platforms.

  
Options?:

  
\* SafeStake

\* Obol

\* Diva Protocol

\* SSV Network

\* Lido (=??)

\* Rocketpool (=??)

Anyways yhe article was from 2 years ago or so. Some big brain and was actually very cool and informative (almost certain it was published on Medium). The cover image stuck with me though

Title was something like:

Ethereum is like a space colony // defi is like a base on mars // web3 is like a space station

I tried searching a bunch of alternatives. Idea was that all these separate moving parts make up this cool ecosystem like a space colony. Maker was in it, Uniswap, other big protocols had their own little base or building and thing were connecting. I think newer protocol was landing it’s ship and plugging in

Pretty sure is was specifically about Ethereum and not all of defi/web3.. but throwing it out there it could have been. The colors of the cover were light and similar to general EF tones.

Been searching for days and can’t find, hopefully someone remembers the actual article (cause I’d like to re-read it as well as reference the cover lol)

Reddit,ethereum,Built a tool for managing & sharing ETH/ERC-20 addresses professionally (Satosh.me),2025-01-08 20:02:47,"Hey Ethereum community! Built something I think could be useful for everyone dealing with multiple ETH/ERC-20 addresses.

**What it is:**

A simple tool ([Satosh.me](http://satosh.me)) that gives you a clean profile page (satosh.me/yourname) to organize and share your Ethereum addresses professionally.

**Key Ethereum Features:**

\- Support for ETH and all ERC-20 tokens

\- Clean way to share different addresses for different tokens

\- Support for ENS domains

\- Track which addresses are being engaged with

\- Dark mode interface (because Web3)

**Why I built it:**

\- Managing multiple addresses for different tokens was getting messy

\- Needed a professional way to share addresses with clients/community

\- Wanted analytics on which addresses get used

\- Tired of copying/pasting addresses from different places

**Technical Details:**

\- No custody of private keys

\- Just manages public addresses

\- Built on Next.js/React

\- Simple dashboard for address management

Everything's free for basic use, with a Pro tier for advanced features (30-day trial available).

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept 3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

Reddit,ethereum,A few questions to staking Ethereum,2025-01-05 03:55:29,"Starting to take crypto seriously after taking a break for 2 years after investing in altcoin. Now mostly Ethereum.  
  
A few questions I have about staking and cold wallet.  
I know most people here likes to stake in Rocketpool because of decentralization.

1. Why must one convert from ETH to rETH to stake? why can't we just stake ETH?

2. How do I safely stake my ETH directly from my cold wallet?

3. Won't there be depegging from ETH to rETH?

4. I know there are risks, but what are the chances of my funds being lost in Rocketpool?",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,ethereum,"""Vitalik Buterin Deserves a Nobel Prize in Economics for His Work on Crypto and Ethereum."": Bankless Co-Founder Ryan Sean Adams",2025-01-03 14:32:32,"In a tweet Ryan Sean Adams - co-founder of Bankless - said that Vitalik Buterin should be recognized with a Nobel prize in economics for his contributions to Ethereum and the entire crypto space. He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

I wonder if one day Vitalik will be remembered as one of the greatest economic innovators of our time",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

I've used etherscan gas tracker and used the current gwei to calculate the price, but it is out by a factor of 100 from what I am quoted by CoinBase.

21000 \* 8 = 168000 = 0.000168 ETH = £0.49

CB total cost = £40 / £20 of this is network fee

I simply just do not understand how to calculate this fee or the total cost and CoinBase aren't much help.

Reddit,ethereum,The Next Upgrade and Global Adoption 2025,2025-01-02 05:29:45,"##**Tech and upgrades coming in 2025**

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

Can someone explain the difference between EIP-7702 – *which will be included in the Pectra upgrade* – and EIP-4337 – *which has been deployed in 2023* – regarding Account Abstraction (AA)?

As far as I understand it, EIP-7702 will allow:  
\- gasless transactions / gas sponsoring: the user could pay in another token like USDC.

\- transactions budling

  
But I thought this was already possible with EIP-4337. What does EIP-7702 brings on the AA, compared to EIP-4337?

I did the exact same thing for Eth.

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

I am no crypto expert, can anyone here help me  find my money ?

Ps : wrote to revolut, they said they don’t know where is the money, and that they are looking

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

Please help

EDIT : Turns out Gatehub sent BTC and ETH on XRP network which is not managed by Revolut. But they still found a way to recover the funds !! So money is safe for now 🤙🏼

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

I’ve been messing around with Solidity and doing some tutorials to get a feel for how everything works. My goal is to eventually create my own project—something small and manageable for now, but hopefully useful or at least a good learning experience.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

I’m looking forward to learning from this community and (fingers crossed) sharing something cool soon!",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Considering debt is one of the largest markets on earth beyond derivatives, I can't help but ask - how can we build non-collateralized debt markets on Ethereum? Are there any current leaders I should be looking out for? How do we hold addresses and users accountable for credit debts? Could credit agencies or banks start working with the Ethereum blockchain? Is it even possible to do this? Looking for any and all insights! ",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,ethereum,Those living in Canada: Do you save up in USDC?,2024-12-28 18:33:37,"Hi!

With the decline of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, are you considering creating your emergency fund in USD?
For sure, you can open an USD account in a traditional bank but do you also consider buying USDC (or other tokens)?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to have a discussion regarding **how relevant (or nor) is it to save up in USDC for a Canadian.** I know a lot of Canadians are already investing in USD anyway.
**Does saving up directly on a USD stablecoin make any sense?**


How I see it:

**Advantages**
- less fees (maybe not, I really don't know what are the fees for a USD account opened in Canada)
- easy to buy 

**Disadvantages**
- **taxes implications?** If you pay your transaction fees in ETH, technically you may have to pay taxes on it (depending on your ACB). Plus, since ERC-20 tokens are considered assets in Canada, you should pay taxes if you make a gain when you spend your USDC (*if USD(C)/CAD goes up in value across time, which is the current consensus*)
- **not easy to spend USD** outside of Crypto space (but crypto cards are democratizing)",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to run a state only node ?,2024-12-28 12:11:33,"Hey,

I'm not really sure how different Ethereum is from Bitcoin in client logic. From my understanding, there are transactions and state (smart contract values, etc...).

In my case, I need to access the read-only features of some smart contracts without spending too much on hardware. 

My current solution was to use an rpc provider, request the state of contract x, then listen for new blocks and update the state on my end based on the transactions received. This is necessary to avoid hitting rate limits, as my usage uses a large number of requests.

The problem is that the ""sync"" part can take days with the current rate limit because I'm using contract calls, which probably isn't the best solution. So I wanted to know if it was possible to run a node without the whole blockchain, just with the state, the goal is not to verify transactions but to know more efficiently the state of specific contracts.

Do you know if this is possible? if not, is it difficult to create my own implementation to request this directly on the network like real nodes do, and include my logic instead?

A kind of ethereum client that  sync only a specific part of the state and does not store or verify transactions",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734
Reddit,ethereum,Can somebody explain how people are still paying $23 or over that for gas fees in the second half of 2024?,2024-12-27 17:18:42,"Hi. I was just following an ETH thread in the cryptocurrency subreddit and various people are claiming they are paying about $30 or even more than that for their gas fees for L1 transactions.

For example, [I saw this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hm4k11/comment/m3tigd0/
):

> Yeah I try to swap $45 worth of ETH for a coin I want and it's costing me $23 gas fees. No thanks. 

I have read other comments in the past few weeks of people still paying something like upper $20 range for gas fees, and I assume their transactions were recently?

How is this possible though?  Checking the gas fee chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#1y, the highest average gas fee in the last 6 months was $14 USD on November 13th.  The gas fee has generally been lower than that in the last 6 months for Ethereum.

I haven't seen any average gas fee over $20 USD since March of 2024 according to that chart.  So how are people still paying like $23, or even in the upper $20 range for their gas fees lately?",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

In the 2,100 days his total investment of $2,100 is now worth $11,883 for a multiplier of 5.65X.

Bitcoin is $94,800 as of today January 10 2025.

He continues to buy $1 daily but has not updated with a new video so we can assume that his numbers are higher.

The power of compounding and DCA. 

However, a lumpsum of $2,100 back in Feb 2019 at $3,400 per BTC would have given him 0.617 BTC. 

The lesson here is regardless of when or how much you buy, the answer is just buy some.

Reddit,bitcoin,"I mined bitcoin for a month in 2011, lost most of it to MtGox, cashed out the rest this month",2025-01-09 22:47:39,"Story Time:

I heard about Bitcoin in 2011, it had just spiked to an ATH of $8, so I thought I would give mining it a try.

The first few days, I was mining 1BTC/day.  Mining rate slowed drastically as BTC gained popularity.

I was sending my BTC to MtGox as it was mined, until the price of BTC crashed again.  I evidently lost interest, and promptly forgot about the \~$20 of BTC I had accumulated.

Come 2014, MtGox shuts down, taking 2/3 of my BTC with it.  I wrote it off entirely, lamenting my loss of a couple hundred $.

2021 rolls around, BTC is at an ATH of $50k.  I hear about the Mt Gox settlement, wondering if I still have my account info.  I can't find it.  
What I *do* find is my old wallet, and see there's still 2BTC in it.

Last month, when BTC hits $100k, I finally decide it's time to cash out the majority of it, for a down payment on a house later this year.

Reddit,bitcoin,The US Government wanting to hold Bitcoin is the biggest inflation warning of my lifetime.,2025-01-09 22:15:51,"They can't call it a strategic reserve. The issuer of the most powerful currency in the world can't just say to the world, ""We're going to hold Bitcoin as a hedge against the dollar ... but it's cool. Just go about your business."" They can't openly undermine the only currency that they can print themselves. It would panic the world. It's basically an admission that they're going to try to print their way out of the debt crisis. 

Everyone else in the world can hold Bitcoin and it's OK. Every other country can accumulate it and it will just be seen as prudent. But not the USA. We are the only ones with control over printing the dollar. The more Bitcoin that the US government tries to quietly accumulate, the more you'll know that the dollar is in big trouble. And the US is f\*\*ked ... because they're the only ones who can't protect themselves. (Not openly anyway.) 

Addendum:
Lots of debate in this thread about the true meaning of a strategic reserve. I will offer this definition for anyone that feels like I'm misunderstanding ""strategic reserve"": 

A strategic reserve is a stockpile of a commodity, like oil, that a government or organization holds back from normal use to be released during unexpected events or disruptions in supply, allowing them to manage crises and stabilize markets by providing a readily available source of that commodity when needed; essentially acting as an emergency buffer against sudden shortages. 

But we don't have to debate the purpose of this reserve.  It's stated explicitly in the bill. 

(3) Just as gold reserves have historically served as a cornerstone of national financial security, Bitcoin represents a digital-age asset capable of enhancing the financial leadership and security of the United States in the 21st century global economy.

(4) The acquisition and long-term storage of substantial quantities of Bitcoin by the United States can strengthen the financial condition of the United States, providing a hedge against economic uncertainty and monetary instability.

(5) Bitcoin, as a decentralized and finitely scarce digital asset, offers unique properties that complement existing national reserves, strengthening the position of the United States dollar in the global financial system.

(6) Diversification of the national assets of the United States to include Bitcoin can enhance financial resilience and position the United States at the forefront of global financial innovation.

It's all about strengthening the US dollar. It isn't farm equipment.  It isn't cheese. It isn't even gold. It's a non inflatable store of value that will presumably shore up the dollar. (While undermining the reputation of the US dollar. ",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734
Reddit,bitcoin,Orange Pilled My Partner,2025-01-10 11:31:56,"This week I orange pilled my girlfriend.

A little backstory here. I have been buying Bitcoin since 2020 and dabbled in other shitcoins at the time. The past 2 years I woke up and have been purely buying Bitcoin, bought a hardware wallet, backed up my seed phrase on stamped metal washers and have been DCAing the entire time.

My partner has always been poor with money and has a fairly large chunk of debt through stupid pay day loans and overdrafts so in Autumn last year, she sold her car in order to clear some debt. Over Christmas and going into this year she had struggled without a car (we live rurally and have no public transport links) so she wanted to buy a new car to use for work.

We found a car, but as she'd put all her money into paying off debt, she has no savings. So, I leant her a chunk of money for a deposit on a sensible reliable car and she was going to pay me back each month.

I have spoken a lot about Bitcoin with her but she never really understood it, but I've given her an incentive to buy some. I got her to set up an account with Strike and have requested for her to DCA into Strike instead of paying me back and she has done exactly that.

Now she keeps asking more and more questions about Bitcoin and she's really starting to understand the benefits that it can offer to all of our lives. The next step is getting her set up with a hardware wallet, but that is another topic for later!",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,bitcoin,A new (Bitcoin) approach to DCA - introducing BCA,2025-01-11 00:11:51,"DCA is defined as dollar cost averaging - as in you buy some bitcoin every day or week or month with a fixed amount of dollars (or any other fiat).

Now don’t laugh at me but I think as bitcoins we ought to ditch DCA for BCA.

The idea came to me because I have been into bitcoin since Sep 2021 - approx 3.3 years. And in this time I have managed to stack nearly 3.3 bitcoins.

So, it turns out that I have been BCAing in at the rate of 1 bitcoin per year.

BCA means buying a fixed amount of bitcoin periodically - every day or every month or every year?

I know, I know …. The odds of my continuing to BCA at the same rate of 1 BTC per year seem bleak now unless:

1) I up my game, OR
2) There is another bear market soon

But there you have it fellow bitcoiners, BCA instead of DCA! What do y’all think?

However, I always get even more skeptical when I see too many people too excited over something. I don’t know many people who buy bitcoin outside of Reddit, but the things I see people say in here make me question if I’m just caught up in the hype sometimes. 

I even visited the buttcoin sub to see if there’s anything that would make me change my mind. So far, nothing changed my opinion on buying crypto. But both bitcoin and buttcoin subs seem a tad too…emotional? About their beliefs.

I normally lean towards the opinion that would recognize both pros and cons. But the things I see on Reddit are either “we will all become billionaires so hodl to your last breath” or “these idiots will lose every penny and they deserve it” type of stuff. 

That genuinely baffles me. Bitcoin does seem to have a lot of potential to be much bigger in the future than it is, but I’m not even sure if the posters in here buy it as a mean to save their money or to satiate their gambling needs.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Assume the password itself isn't crackable, at least for the purpose of this discussion. Though I'm open to hearing your thoughts on the password if indeed that remains the one big barrier to keeping a seed on the cloud. 

What's the best container? Does RAR have useful exploits? Is there something else that would be pretty universal to access, and not controlled by a single proprietary source? I mean, I'm putting trust into ledger at this point (a different discussion, I know!) surely there's an anywhere accessible way of storing your seed that would take a bunch of complicated and unlikely steps for a hacker to even know about, let alone access.

Now, my question is, given that my home setup has limited bandwidth (data-wise), I have already limited the usage using maxuploadtarget=500MB in my Bitcoin Core configuration. This limits the number of historical blocks that can be downloaded from me by other nodes. 

In the very unlikely scenario that I find a proper block, would these settings be compliant? What I mean is, if my node has already done a 500MB upload, will it still be able to push my newly found block to other connected nodes?

Reddit,bitcoin,My son set up his first cold wallet,2025-01-09 19:40:07,"I'm proud to share that my son set up his first cold wallet yesterday. Most of all I'm proud of the questions he asked during the process and the decisions he made to manage the risks of self-custody.

He generally followed Coinkite's ""medium grade"" instructions for initializing a ColdCard hardware wallet, including verifying the authenticity of the device itself and the latest firmware, and for updating the firmware on the device using an air gapped microSD card. He used dice rolls to add randomness to the entropy from the device's TRNG, and added a passphrase to the seed.

He recorded all of the recovery information, including the derivation path, the wallet's fingerprint and first four addresses on paper, then reset the ColdCard (using the ""destroy seed"" command). He then recovered the wallet on the ColdCard and verified the fingerprint and the first four addresses. All of this was done offline, powering the device from a USB adapter rather than plugging it into a computer. (He tried using a USB battery brick but the one he had kept shutting down due to too little current drawn by the ColdCard.)

Having proved that his recovery information was complete and accurate, he exported the extended public key as an Electrum watch-only wallet file onto a microSD card and imported it into Electrum on a PC that doesn't leave the house. In Electrum, he verified the wallet's fingerprint and the first four addresses.

He stamped his 24-word seed mnemonic into numbered, stainless steel washers and sealed the washers in a watertight container which will be stored in a non-obvious but easily memorable location at home. His passphrase is stored digitally in a reputable cloud password keeper. We're evaluating options for secure storage of second copies of both the mnemonic and the passphrase in geographically separate locations. He's also considering putting a small amount of coins in the passphrase-less wallet that one would get from only the mnemonic as a ""tripwire"" to detect that the mnemonic has been compromised (especially after he puts redundant copies of it in other geo locations).

Having created permanent, accessible copies of the mnemonic and passphrase, he then reset the ColdCard a final time. Since he has no plans to spend from his wallet for at least five years, he decided he doesn't need a ready-to-use signing device, and he doesn't want a PIN--another secret which would need to be stored securely--to be the only thing that prevents someone who might find the ColdCard from stealing his coins. 

**There are now ZERO devices in the world that can sign transactions from his cold wallet.** There are no single points of compromise (where someone who finds *some* of the recovery information can easily discover the rest of the recovery information) and soon there will be no single points of failure (where the loss or inaccessibility of one of his stored secrets will prevent him from recovering his wallet).

He's ready to make his first Bitcoin transfer from an exchange to the watch-only wallet. I think he's covered his bases for privacy, redundancy, theft-proofing and seizure-proofing appropriately.

Reddit,bitcoin,Should I Stick to My Bitcoin Investment?,2025-01-10 19:50:52,"Hey everyone, I've had a question on my mind for a while now, and I'd like to share it with you. Currently, 75% of my portfolio is in Bitcoin. I've been steadily increasing my investment in it for the past 5-6 years. The remaining 15% is filled with promising altcoins, while the last 10% is made up of highly risky coins with no solid projects or logic behind them — basically, a bunch of meme coins.



Now, here's my dilemma: Should I gradually reduce my Bitcoin investment to around 50%? Let me explain why I'm considering this. Lately, I've been making a lot of money from altcoin trading, but at the same time, I just can't seem to let go of Bitcoin.

Reddit,bitcoin,California Fires and Bitcoin,2025-01-09 16:45:39,"First responder and Bitcoin maxi here. There is nothing like working for the government to make you not trust it. I cannot express the amount of devastation I've seen over the last two days. It felt like I was in the middle of a war zone. Fires, explosions, power outages, injured people, people refusing to leave their residences as they were going up in flames, helpless people trying to recover what they could—99 % of what they owned gone in an instant.

It's important to note that these people did not live in the mountains or hills. We are several miles from the base of the closest mountain. These are populated communities. This could happen anywhere at any time, something I did not fully understand until the last two days.

How is this relative to Bitcoin.

1. Seed phrases and self custody.

I've preached this several times before. If you self custody any meaningful amount, you should use multi-sig with geographically dispersed keys. Splitting one key in half or three locations is not a good idea. Suppose you lose one part of that; you won't be able to recover anything. You can also look into Bitcoin-only companies who assist with multi-sig. Unchained and SWAN are two off the top of my head. You hold two keys; they hold one. You can still recover your funds if you lose or have one key compromised.

Edit: Put your keys onto fireproof steel. Then you have a chance to recover it. That being said, we have also had some looting. If your house burns down and you can't get back to it for a day or two, your seed (if recovered) may already be compromised. This further enforces the multi-sig point.

2) Bitcoin is a safer investment than real estate.

""You can't live in a Bitcoin"" - Very true. But I can rent and put the excess money into Bitcoin. I hope insurance helps people who have lost everything. Even if they are compensated financially, the process will take years, and they will never truly make up for the property they lost. Bitcoin does not have nearly as much counterparty risk. Matthew Kratter has two great videos on this subject: [https://youtu.be/0l-mlHw3Bz0?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/0l-mlHw3Bz0?feature=shared) and [https://youtu.be/7uYVcDa\_t6M?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/7uYVcDa_t6M?feature=shared) . Although I had already watched these videos and agreed to some extent, the last few days have hammered these points home.

Just remember, devastation like this can happen to you, no matter where you are. Plan accordingly.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Now comes the tricky part: I had some KYC BYC from an exchange. Without thinking I sent those sats to the same wallet and address where my non KYC BTC are stored. In doing so, did I mix my stack and is it tainted now? Or can I still keep my non KYC sats separated from the KYC ones? So far I have not sent any sats from the Electrum wallet to any addresses.

So obviously for a currency to work it needs to have enough units in circulation to buy basic things. Bitcoin is capable of being lost forever and this is considered not a problem because it just drives the value up of each individual unit, thus making sats more valuable. As of right now, they’re worth very very little. But lets say enough bitcoin is lost that an individual sat is worth too much to reasonably purchase a cheeseburger or other common low cost goods. 

Imagine a world where all but 1 bitcoin (100,000,000 sats) is lost. Would this ruin the value of bitcoin as a currency? Or is it possible to change the source code so that it could be divided even smaller? ",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

I would like to run a Bitcoin Full Node on my Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit). The Pi is booted from an external 2TB SSD which, before imaging the OS, I formated to ext4 and on which I would run the whole node. The Pi is only intended for running a full node. I only want to run the full node to support the network.Even though the Pi is only connected to my guest wifi, I would like to not display the IP adress openly, so I would like to run it via Tor. 

I'm quite a tech noob, so even though I'm trying to follow several different tutorials througout the last days, I somehow does not get it set up properly, especially because all tutorials I found so far connecting the concept of full node & tor are for older version of bitcoin core or older Pi's and somehow sth is always not working the way it seems in the tutorial or it seems as if some step is missing or the tutorial is just the closest I get to my setup but always different enough that at some point the path they take and the path I have to take seperate.

So is there maybe someone that can kind of lead me through the process maybe?  
It's kind of weird that I can't find anything about this so far, because I can't imagine it being that complicated - in essence, I guess, it should be sth along the way of   
1. install tor  
2. install bitcoin core  
3. change torrc  
4. change bitcoin.conf  
5. run bitcoin core, download blockchain and then just let it run

but I kind of just can't get it set up. So can someone maybe help me with this?

additional: I can't grasp the whole thing about the portforwarding. Is this necessary for supporting the network and if so, isn't this a security risk for my network/device? How can I minimize/eradicate this risk or is using tor already a good security measure for this?  
Maybe necessary info: my wifi is secured with at least WPA2 (maybe WPA3, I'm not quite sure right now) and a pretty strong password (the whole long as hell, different characters, numbers, blabla stuff).",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Can't store your private keys on your phone. It's a piece of paper people often keep it where it's safest (their homes). Aside from breaking ins and theft, fire hazard is the biggest risk. Wouldn't wish it on anybody to go for a trip and then come back to a burned down house where possibly a piece of paper inside is worth more than the house and land. Well, unless you have one of these metallic private keys but I think not everyone has them. Also it's easier said than done, but finding a piece of tiny square amidst a burned down house with tons of ash, debris, wood, etc. is harder than you might think.

People are reporting house values but we still don't know what the crypto values are and I'm sure they must have kept some there.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"PSA 10 Charizard Card Fetches $200,000+ on Courtyard.io",2025-01-10 14:55:19,"In an unprecedented event in the world of collectibles, a PSA 10 graded 1999 Base Set 1st Edition Holo Shadowless Charizard card has been sold for at least $200,000 through the blockchain-based marketplace, Courtyard. This sale not only marks a significant moment for Pokémon card collectors but also highlights the growing intersection between traditional collectibles and modern blockchain technology.

I'm unsure of the exact price as there is conflicting data out there - a twitter post reposted by Courtyard says $220K, while on Courtyard's site the winning bid says $200K. I've reached out to the Courtyard team for confirmation and will update when I get clarity. Regardless, $20K doesn't make that much of a difference in terms of what this means overall for RWAs and onchain assets.  
EDIT: On Courtyard, the buyer pays a 10% premium. So that card sold for $200K, which went to Polygon, and the buyer paid $220K, $20K which goes to Courtyard. That's why there are the 2 different numbers.

The card, renowned for its rarity and perfect condition, is one of the most sought-after pieces from the Pokémon Trading Card Game's initial release. Graded Gem Mint 10 by the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), this Charizard card is from the very first edition of the Pokémon card game, making it a collector's holy grail. The 'Shadowless' designation further elevates its value, as it refers to an early print run where the card did not have a white border around the artwork, a feature that was added in later prints.

Courtyard, a platform that tokenizes physical collectibles into NFTs on the Polygon network, facilitated this sale. This particular card was tokenized while being physically stored in a Brink's vault, combining traditional security measures with the transparency and security of blockchain tracking. It can be redeemed at any time by the owner. The NFT gets burned and the card is sent to owner.

The auction attracted collectors and investors from around the globe, showcasing the increasing interest in high-value collectibles in the digital age. The final sale price of set a new benchmark for onchain physical card sales, indicating the high demand for rare Pokémon cards in both physical and digital formats.

This is validation for the growing market for tokenized assets. ""This auction isn't just about a Charizard card; it's about showing how blockchain can revolutionize the collectibles world,"" stated Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, underscoring the broader implications of this sale for the collectibles market.

The implications of such a sale extend beyond just Pokémon cards. It signifies a shift towards integrating high-value physical assets with digital ownership, potentially paving the way for more traditional collectibles to enter the blockchain space. As the market for NFTs and tokenized assets continues to mature, this sale could be remembered as a pivotal moment where the worlds of traditional collecting and digital innovation truly converged.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"The recent post about burning homes and self custody, has made me realize the incredible changes crypto is bringing. We suddenly have all these new options for our security, this new way to control our money, with choices.  It can be overwhelming to go from no choice to extensive choices",2025-01-10 17:42:17,"The post was full of comments about so many different options and different things you can do to secure your funds. Not just from a fire, but to secure your money in any way you want.

Growing up with traditional finance, like most people, I never had to worry about choices, because I didn't really have any. I handed my money to the bank, and handed over custody. It's now their way or the highway. It's not like I can pick how a bank should secure itself.

But it would be nice to have more options and adaptability.

Crypto opens up a world of options and adaptability.

You still have the option of going the traditional way with your crypto if you want, or the option of control.

There's not much limit in how creative you can get with your security once you have that full control. Basically, just about every type of security system in the world becomes available to you and becomes an option for your security. That's the power of integration of crypto. It's a purely mathematical system, where something as simple as a 24 word phrase can recover your funds.

I can have simple security, and boost practicality if I'm more interested in easy 24/7 access from my home. Or I can focus on security with worldwide access. Or I can focus on top notch level of security that would make a bank deposit box seem as unsafe as an unlocked Tesla parked in the middle of San Fransisco.

Once you have control of a tool that has this level of integration, has already top notch encryption, decentralization, and a worldwide secure network, then you have unprecedented power over your funds.

Blockchain and decentralization took out the key caveat that have always stood between our full control and security.

It's a system that puts the control back in your hands, which means that it's a system that's only limited by you.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Have business owners here added crypto to a means of receiving B2B payments? How well has it been adopted?,2025-01-10 16:47:10,"For various regulatory reasons some foreign clients are having a hard time EFT-ing payments to us, such that we've had to resort to - \*cough\* taking cheques \*cough cough\* instead. This is a completely legitimate industry, no hanky panky here, but some American banks are hyper-sensitive (due to their state locale) and won't play nice with foreign EFT remittance.

I'd really rather not take a foreign cheque as it's a long processing time (up to 2 weeks) and a real administrative hassle. So the idea of taking crypto, like USDC has come up in our internal discussion.

To the business crypto crowd, has anyone implemented crypto as a means of B2B payments for your services/products? How was the adoption, did you get a meaningful % of users? Did you get scoffed at by any clients because they felt crypto was a laughable way to do business? Were there other hurdles, like inexperience on their end of even getting set up with a crypto account?

The inclusion of digital assets in the GMC’s strategic reserves will enhance the SAR’s economic resilience, and is an evolution of the jurisdiction’s involvement in bitcoin mining.

For its strategic reserves, GMC intends to recognise digital assets that have large market capitalisations and deep liquidity to ensure that they can be easily bought and sold with minimal price impact. In addition, GMC will look to recognise digital assets that are issued on more mature, secure blockchains that support monitoring of on-chain transactions.

Here’s the deal: this token isn’t mined with rigs or algorithms. It’s mined by voting. Yep, voting. Every vote you cast contributes to something they call Coin Mining Progress (CMP). Hit 100 CMP, and you’ve completed a block. The reward? Freshly minted tokens.

But here’s the twist if you don’t own their “Mining Voting Machine” or a short-term Mining Pass, those tokens go to the platform’s treasury instead of your wallet. Fair or frustrating? You decide.

The whole thing is built on a capped supply of 21 million tokens, with a halving mechanism to keep it scarce. And the platform actually gives the tokens utility buying stuff in-game, trading, or just holding on for future value.

It’s refreshing to see a project with a concept beyond hype. Voting to mine tokens feels innovative, even if it’s a bit quirky. So, is this the future of crypto or just another experiment? I’ll leave it to you to decide.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Even my fiancé still thinks crypto is a joke and her eyes glaze over when I go into any detail about it.

I feel that most of women who got involved in crypto so far happened in the peak of the bull market cycle and most of them likely got burned.  How do we get more females involved and excited about crypto in the future to help balance out the demographics?  Will they always view it as too risky of a category to invest or does it simply take more marketing and education through the right channels?  Just think how much more adoption for the masses we could achieve even if female crypto investors climbs to 30% or 40% this cycle.

Say it does get regulated, institutional money is going to be in the driver’s seat from then on- and I hate to say this, but I’m 99% sure they are not investing in anything without utility for real world purposes. With saying that however, maybe retail does continue trading and swinging memes. Nobody knows.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Reddit,crypto,Hashing conundrums,2024-12-20 20:49:23,"I have two questions about hashing that I thought might as well be merged into one post.

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

I wanted to reach out and apologize for removing my recent post about AMBER256. Upon reflection, I realized that I currently lack the necessary expertise to develop a robust cryptographic algorithm. My intention was never to spread an unsound or insecure algorithm, and I believe it's important to prevent the dissemination of potentially flawed cryptographic methods.

Before I revisit this project, I plan to dedicate significant time to studying existing implementations and understanding possible attacks. My goal is to ensure that any future contributions I make are both meaningful and secure.

I am sincerely sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. I also want to thank everyone who offered support and constructive feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your understanding.

Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to engaging with the community again once I have gained more knowledge in this field.",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734
Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21).

And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-11 00:53:26.305734

To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, *maybe, eventually,* someone will need to *start thinking about* migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack.

Given SHA256 is supposed to be random and well distributed, is it true to say that essentially each output can have an infinite and relatively equal number of collisions generated by infinite inputs.

i.e. given in reality we have infinite inputs to feed the function (think arbitrary long binary numbers), can we assume that a properly functioning hash function has ""even and reachable"" collisions across it's output space?
