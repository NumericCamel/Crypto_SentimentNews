Supporters are rubbing their hands in glee that their beloved pet project, a CBDC for the Euro, may finally become a reality. It’s been languishing in legislative limbo since 2023, as lawmakers were skeptical of the project. The chances of the digital Euro being ready by the end of this year are slim at best. Even so, with major pro-crypto moves on both sides of the Atlantic, it’s a good time to get your crypto wallet ready. And while you’re at it, claim all the early-adopter benefits of Best Wallet’s $BEST token. An EU Central Bank Digital Currency to Keep Capital Onshore President Trump’s support of crypto stablecoins seems to have lit a fire under Brussels. The EU Parliament is fearful that Trump’s plan to let people pay with US stablecoins could empty European bank vaults, as they move their money across. So the digital Euro project is back on again to make sure Euros stay in Europe. An EU stablecoin would be backed by the European Central Bank (ECB), providing a bulwark against any attempt by the US to destabilize European currency markets. The success of the project would most likely result in many more national stablecoins being launched in the future. Even though Trump has banned the creation of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC) for now, that could change in the future. Then it would definitely be game on. Good News For Non-Custodial Decentralized Wallets If government-backed stablecoin currencies become the norm, we’re all going to need a crypto wallet. Preferably one that’s non-custodial, no KYC (Know Your Customer), and fully decentralized. Step up, Best Wallet. Our Best Wallet review found this wallet app gives other top crypto wallets a run for their money – promising everything future CBDC users will need to participate in a crypto economy. Unique selling points include the promise of a debit card and 8% cashback on every offline transaction. And now, with the launch of Best Wallet’s own coin – the Best Wallet Token – the $BEST ecosystem could indeed go onto achieve its ambition of grabbing some 40% of the $11B+ crypto wallet market by next year. Time to Buy Best Wallet Tokens If Best Wallet is about to become the Daddy of crypto wallets, now would be an excellent time to get in while the $BEST token is still in presale, and therefore much cheaper, (now at $0.0239). As a $BEST holder, you’ll also get extra benefits like cheaper transaction fees when using the Best Wallet app, higher staking rewards (currently at 185%), and voting and governance rights. To buy into the future, just head over to the official Best Wallet Token presale, connect your wallet, and buy your coins with either a crypto balance or a credit card. But you need to be quick – you have just over 24 hours to get your tokens before the price increases again. Never Use Funds You Can’t Afford To Potentially Lose The outlook for an EU CBDC and for Best Wallet Token is certainly bullish, but nothing in life is guaranteed except death and taxes. That’s why you need to always stop for a moment, take a breath, and review your options. We can only make recommendations, not guarantees. That said, as global crypto adoption surges, we think $BEST could be worth a second look.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

This change is a sign that the market is maturing and attracting more institutional investors, who had previously avoided its volatile price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bold Prediction: XRP Holders On The Path To Millionaire Status—Analyst Bitcoin 3-Month Volatility Down To New Lows According to the most recent data from Glassnode, the cryptocurrency’s three-month realized volatility has fallen to all-time lows. The days of jaw-dropping 80–100% price swings are over. With volatility staying below 50%, Bitcoin is still moving in a fairly stable direction today. This newfound stability isn’t just a fleeting moment – it’s reshaping the entire market landscape. Institutional Powerhouses Step Up With a solid $40 billion in net inflows, the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs has completely transformed the market. In addition to countries making calculated investments in Bitcoin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is spearheading this institutional push. The market’s reaction has been intriguing: rather than the typical peaks and troughs, Bitcoin now exhibits a “stair-stepping” development pattern, with price surges interspersed with consolidation periods. The Impact Of Whales On Market Dynamics An interesting trend can be seen in a recent data: Over a hundred new wallets containing at least 100 BTC units were added in February, whereas nearly 138,000 smaller ones suffered a decline in holdings. This development provides important insight into the mood of the market. While newer traders who joined within the last six months are selling due to short-term market swings, large investors, commonly referred to as “whales,” are discreetly accumulating Bitcoin during price falls.

A key change in the cryptocurrency world is how Bitcoin has transformed from a highly unpredictable investment to a more dependable option. Bitcoin might be starting to become a reliable financial asset if big investors keep putting money in and large holders continue to buy more.

According to an analyst, the cryptocurrency’s recovery and ongoing retests of this crucial level could lead to a rebound in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility ‘Relatively Low’ Despite Market Shakeouts – Analysts Eye This Crucial Level Aptos Recovers From 6-Month Low Aptos has recovered 24% from the recent market correction, which sent Bitcoin to $91,000 and most cryptocurrencies to monthly lows. On Sunday, the token briefly nosedived 34% from its daily high above $7 to its lowest price since August 2024. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that APT has been moving within two horizontal levels since its launch. The higher horizontal level ranges from $15 to $17, while the lower zone ranges from around $4.80 to $5.45. During the pullback, Aptos “didn’t quite sweep the August lows” but “held on to that same ~$5 area again,” Daan pointed out. Similarly, Crypto Analyst Rekt Capital analyzed the cryptocurrency’s recent performance, explaining that “APT has now dropped into the Macro Wedge Bottom, holding support there while producing downside wicking below it.” APT’s Macro Wedge Bottom is also the “technical uptrend line dating to early 2023,” which is crucial to maintaining the technical uptrend and the macro market structure in general. Rekt Capital suggests that the cryptocurrency must print Weekly Closed above this line, at around $5.97. However, he noted that, in the monthly timeframe, APT appears to be in a Macro Range. The analyst explains that, in this Macro Range, APT seems to be developing a third cluster, but the price needs to hold the crucial $5.45 support zone to maintain this range and rebound. If the cryptocurrency holds continued stability above this level, it could reverse in the following months, as previous clusters saw “several after three monthly candles at the Range Low.” However, the price could see several retests before a rebound. He pointed out that the previous consolidations included a “downside wicking below support.” APT To Breakout In Three Months? If Aptos reverses, its price must break its 11-month downtrend. According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, a rejection from the downtrend line, followed by a drop to the Range Low, could “spell that the rebounds from the Macro Range Low are getting weaker, signaling weakening support there.” As a result, APT needs a strong rebound from this Macro Range Low “to go against the diminishing returns” that seem to be developing from this range. The 2023 rebound saw Aptos bounce 211% from the range lows before facing resistance near ATH levels, while 2024’s price rebound recorded a 145% jump before retracing from the $13 mark. Related Reading: Memecoins Crowned As ‘Defining Narrative Of 2024’, What’s The Next Key Sector To Watch? This suggests a potential diminishing in returns from the range low, signaling that Aptos must climb 95%, above the $11 resistance, to break out of the downtrend line. The analysis concluded that price stability at $5.45 is vital for the cryptocurrency’s rally, and a Monthly Close above this level is necessary for a future price rebound and retest of the downtrend. As of this writing, APT trades at $5.74, a 23% decrease in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse Is Still Signaling A Bull Market In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the latest trend in the Coinbase Flow Pulse for Bitcoin. The “Coinbase Flow Pulse” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of BTC that’s moving between Coinbase and other exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means coins are flowing from wallets associated with other exchanges to those connected to Coinbase. On the other hand, the indicator being under zero implies Coinbase is going through outflows. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Crash To $1,700 If This Support Fails, Analyst Says Now, here is the chart for the Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its 30-day and 90-day simple moving averages (SMAs) over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day SMA of the Bitcoin Coinbase Flow Pulse surged above the 90-day a few months back and has since maintained its steep climb, creating distance between the two lines. Historically, this type of crossover has signaled a shift toward a bull market phase for Bitcoin. Clearly, BTC hasn’t seen the reverse type of crossover yet, so this signal could still be considered active. The 30-day MA crossing above the 90-day MA implies that inflows into Coinbase are gaining momentum. The reason this acts as a bullish signal for BTC is that the platform is primarily used by institutional entities based in the US. Whenever coins are flowing into Coinbase, it’s a sign that these American traders are interested in the cryptocurrency. As the analyst explains, Currently, a bullish phase prevails, driven by strong institutional interest. The absence of significant red zones indicates no large-scale outflows typically seen in a bear market when capital shifts from the spot market to futures. While a transfer of wealth from other exchanges to Coinbase is a positive sign for Bitcoin, exchange inflows that occur from self-custodial wallets can be a bearish sign instead. Fortunately, BTC doesn’t have to worry about this for now as the BTC Exchange Reserve, a metric that measures the total amount of the asset sitting on centralized exchanges, has plunged.

Today, Bitcoin hovers just above $98,000, marking a nearly 10% decline from its all-time high of over $109,000 recorded last month. Interestingly, while BTC’s price has slowed, its exchange reserve has faced the same fate, with data showing a continuous decline from this metric. Related Reading: 49,700 Dormant Bitcoin Just Moved—What’s Next For BTC’s Price? Does This Suggest An Incoming Rebound For Bitcoin? ShayanBTC, one contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTae platform, particularly pointed out this trend in a post titled “Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge: Is Supply Shock Driving the Next Rally.” According to Shayan, there is a chance that this reserve plunge will become favorable for BTC in the near term. In the post, Shayan disclosed that exchange reserves—the amount of Bitcoin held on trading platforms—have steadily decreased. This trend often signals an accumulation phase by investors, as more market participants withdraw their BTC from exchanges to secure long-term holdings. This reduced circulating supply can create a “supply shock,” potentially driving higher prices in the coming weeks. “As shown in the chart, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been on an aggressive decline, signaling an accumulation phase by investors,” Shayan explained. The analyst added: Given that exchange reserves serve as a supply-side indicator, this persistent decline could contribute to further price appreciation in the coming weeks.

A positive premium can indicate strong buying pressure on Coinbase, signaling institutional demand. The latest data shows that in recent days, the Coinbase Premium Index broke through the critical “0” resistance level with substantial volume, an occurrence that traders closely monitor. TraderOasis, another CryptoQuant analyst, highlighted that this breakout area also functions as a support/resistance level, making it a crucial point of interest.

It started a pullback from the $619 high, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a drop below the $600 support zone. The price even dived below the $580 level. A low was formed at $559 and the price recently started a decent recovery wave. There was a move above the $570 level.

There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $578 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading near $580 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $590 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $619 swing high to the $559 low. The next resistance sits near the $595 level. A clear move above the $595 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $605. A close above the $605 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $632 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $590 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $570 level. The next major support is near the $560 level.

The analyst also revealed the price level, which he believes is ideal for market participants to buy and hold XRP.  XRP Price Eyes 40% Gains As Analyst Reveals Key Level In a TradingView post, ProjectSyndicate predicted that the XRP price could witness a 40% move to the upside soon enough. This came following his analysis of XRP’s 4-hour chart. He noted that the outlook remains bullish despite the current pullback in progress. The analyst added that buying low is still a perfect trade setup with low risk.  Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Descending Triangle On The Daily Chart, Why $1.95 Is Important Project Syndicate remarked that the price is currently in correction mode after the retest of the all-time high. He added that there is limited upside at the current market price of $2.50. In line with this, he asserted that the pullback isn’t complete and predicted that XRP could still drop to as low as $2 before it records the 40% gains that he predicted.  Based on his strategy of buying low, he recommended that market participants should look to buy and hold the crypto when its price drops to $2. He also advised that they should take profit when XRP records the 40% gains as it rebounds to $2.80.  The XRP price has suffered one of the worst pullbacks among the major caps amid the current bearish sentiment in the crypto market. As a result, XRP has also lost its spot as the third-largest crypto by market cap, dropping to number four behind USDT.  However, amid this pullback, crypto analyst ColdBloodedCharter has also stated that now is a great opportunity to accumulate XRP. He highlighted $2.50, between $2.25 and $2.30, and between $1.90 and $2 as buy-the-dip levels that “make sense.” This Pullback Could Be The Final Low Before Liftoff In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades raised the possibility of this pullback being the final low before a price liftoff. She asserted that there has been no change to the overall bullish setup on XRP, although the crypto is now targetting Wave 3 down extensions at $2.16, $1.87, and $1.57 for the next major support.  Related Reading: XRP’s Price Breakout Sets The Tone For A Historic Bull Run To A New All-Time High The crypto analyst opined that the XRP price is in the fifth wave of C within an ABC pattern for a large Wave 2. She added that the sell-off massively extended the asset past C targets, but the pattern still needs to be completed. With this development, CasiTrades stated that this means that XRP could be at the final low before a massive Wave 3 up begins. She added that this would send the altcoin past previous all-time highs (ATHs) with minimal resistance.  At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.45, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Network Activity Slumps To One-Year Low – Is BTC Overpriced?,2025-02-07 03:30:12+00:00,"According to a recent CryptoQuant Research post, Bitcoin (BTC) network activity has slumped to a 12-month low, with CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index currently at its lowest level since February 2024. Bitcoin Network Activity Drops As Market Consolidates Data from CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index shows that activity has declined by 15% from its peak in November 2024. As of February 5, the Index stands at 3,760, marking its lowest level in the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Hour RSI Hits Oversold Zone – Is A BTC Rebound Near? The decline in network activity is primarily attributed to a sharp drop in the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. From an all-time high (ATH) of 734,000 transactions in September 2024, the total daily transaction count has fallen by 53% to 346,000. According to CryptoQuant, this downturn in BTC network activity is largely driven by a decline in the use of the Runes Protocol for minting tokens on the blockchain. The post explains: This is evident in the total daily number of OP RETURN codes in Bitcoin transactions, which the RUNES protocol uses to write data about token mints and transfers on the network. When the RUNES protocol emerged in April 2024, the daily number of OP RETURN codes spiked to 802K. However, the number of OP RETURN code has plummeted since, with only 10K OP RETURN codes used. For the uninitiated, The Runes Protocol is a new token standard for BTC, designed to enable fungible token creation directly on the network without requiring off-chain data or complex smart contracts. It aims to be more efficient and scalable than previous Bitcoin tokenization methods like Ordinals and BRC-20. Further evidence of reduced network activity is visible in Bitcoin mempool traffic. The total number of pending transactions waiting to be confirmed in a Bitcoin block has plummeted by 99%, from 287,000 in December 2024 to just 3,000 as of February 5, 2025. Notably, this is the lowest level of mempool traffic since March 2022. Is BTC Overvalued At Current Price? The analysis suggests that, based on network activity, Bitcoin’s fair value currently falls between $48,000 and $95,000. This implies that BTC’s current market price of around $98,000 may be overvalued. Related Reading: Bitcoin Withstands DeepSeek Dip And FOMC Volatility – How Close Is A New ATH? However, another CryptoQuant contributor argues that the current Bitcoin price presents a strong buying opportunity for investors looking to dollar-cost average their holdings. Similarly, another analyst suggests that BTC’s recent market performance indicates it is in the distribution phase of the market cycle. Despite short-term concerns, the long-term outlook for BTC remains bullish. A Standard Chartered executive recently predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $97,914, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Price Stuck in Slow Gear: Will a Breakout Come Soon?,2025-02-07 03:28:36+00:00,"Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,650 zone. ETH is now struggling to clear the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,620 zone. The price is trading below $2,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,800 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Could Soon Fade Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $2,550 level, like Bitcoin. ETH was able to surpass the $2,600 and $2,620 resistance levels to move into a short-term positive zone. The price was able to surpass the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. However, the bears seem to be active below the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels. The price is again moving lower. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,770 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,800 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,050 resistance zone or even $3,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,800 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,630 level. The first major support sits near the $2,600 zone. A clear move below the $2,600 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Reddit,solana,"Why Liquid Staking is Better Than Staking on Centralized Exchanges (and Why You Should Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase)",2025-02-06 22:52:53,"Hey,  
I have been seeing a lot of questions about staking lately, especially around liquid staking vs. staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, or Bybit. I wanted to share my thoughts on why liquid staking is the better move and why you should avoid staking SOL on Binance (bSOL), Bybit, or even Coinbase.

**1. Liquid Staking Gives You Flexibility**  
When you stake SOL through liquid staking protocols (like Marinade, Lido, The Vault or Jito), you get a liquid staked token (e.g., mSOL, stSOL, or jitoSOL, vSOL) in return. This means you can still use your staked SOL in DeFi..lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity while earning staking rewards. It’s the best of both worlds: you’re securing the network and earning yield, but you’re not locked out of using your funds.

With centralized exchanges, your SOL is locked up. You can’t do anything with it until you unstake (which can take days). That’s a huge opportunity cost, especially in a fast-moving ecosystem like Solana where DeFi opportunities are everywhere.

**2. Decentralization Matters**  
Staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase means they control the validators. This centralizes power and goes against the whole ethos of crypto. Solana is all about decentralization, and by staking with independent validators (or through liquid staking protocols that delegate to them), you’re helping keep the network secure and decentralized.

**3. The Vault Supports Decentralization by Delegating to Community-Driven Validators**  
One thing I love about liquid staking protocols like The Vault is that they actively support decentralization. For example, The Vault delegates to validators that are actively involved in the Solana community. These validators aren’t just big players with massive stakes, they’re smaller, community-driven operators who contribute to the ecosystem. By staking through The Vault, you’re not just earning rewards; you’re helping grow a more decentralized and resilient network.

**4. Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase**  
This is where it gets sketchy. Binance’s bSOL and Bybit’s staked SOL are essentially IOU tokens. You’re not actually staking on the Solana network, you’re trusting Binance or Bybit to do it for you. This adds unnecessary counterparty risk. What happens if Binance or Bybit gets hacked, goes down, or decides to freeze withdrawals? You’re stuck.

Coinbase isn’t much better. I used to stake my SOL on Coinbase because it was “easy,” but I quickly realized I was getting a lower APY compared to liquid staking or even direct staking. Plus, Coinbase takes a (35%) cut of your rewards, so you’re leaving money on the table. And just like Binance and Bybit, you’re trusting a centralized entity with your funds. If Coinbase has issues (like they did during the SEC lawsuit), your staked SOL could be at risk.

**5. Better Yields with Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking protocols often offer competitive APYs, and you can boost your returns even further by using your liquid staked tokens in DeFi. For example, you can deposit vSOL or jitoSOL into a lending platform or LP pool and stack yields. Centralized exchanges can’t compete with that.  


I used to stake on Coinbase because it felt “safe” and familiar, but once I learned more about how staking works and the risks of centralized exchanges, I switched to liquid staking. Now I use The Vault, and it’s been a game-changer. Not only am I earning better yields, but I can also use my vSOL in DeFi to maximize my returns. Plus, knowing that my stake is supporting community-driven validators through The Vault makes me feel like I’m actually contributing to Solana’s growth. It’s a no-brainer once you understand the benefits.

What do you guys think? Anyone else make the switch from CEX staking to liquid staking? ",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Simming the position of SOL-RAY on Metrix shows that if you were to put down $10k based on a reasonable exposure percentage you're looking at about 100% APR give or take across 90 days. 

Is it me or do these seem to be too good to be true? You're looking at a full return within 9 months if compounding. 

Has anyone had experience of this pool? I'm looking for pools that correlate well to minimise impermanent loss etc.

Thanks.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

I've been researching recently about how much im making from trading and how much fees im paying for a possibility of running my own.

So I started a fresh wallet with 3 SOL, hoping that'll make reviewing PNLs easier. After 4 days of trading I checked GMGN and while my wallet holds 19.43(16.43 profit) sol my PNL shows I have earned 26 sol, so about 10 sol off. I assume that 10sol was due to fees.

Now I need some info incase im missing something on the costing of running my own bot.

\- VM to run code base. I assume I dont need some heavy stuff here 100$ a month budget might be too much?  
\-Node, here is where things get complicated, Ive seen nodes under 49$ that claims to have optimisation for trading, others suggest getting a dedicated node(2500$).  
\-And the thing im most concerned about is if there would still be percentage fees to execute my trades.

Best case im looking at 150 USD worst would be 2500+percentage fee, with my worst case scenario making the project moot. So info on my third point would be highly appreciated.

Reddit,solana,Is Berachain a Threat to Solana? Seeking Insights!,2025-02-06 00:58:43,"Hey everyone,

I recently came across Berachain, and it got me thinking—could this be the next big thing that challenges Solana? From what I’ve seen, it’s gaining traction, but I don’t fully understand the technology behind it.

Solana is known for its speed and low transaction costs, making it a favorite among developers and traders. However, it has faced its fair share of network congestion and downtime issues. If Berachain offers a more efficient and scalable solution, could it take market share from Solana?

I’d love to hear from those who understand Berachain’s architecture better. How does its consensus mechanism work? What makes it different from Solana, and do you think it has the potential to outperform it in the long run?

Looking forward to some insights from the community! 🚀",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Connect and interact with a private node easily
Execute transactions faster than public RPCs
Automate processes like trading, token interactions, or copy trading

Reddit,solana,From being addicted to gambling to meme coins,2025-02-04 17:34:47,"I’m 30 years old, wife, no kid yet. My wife and I make decent salary compared to cost of living. (Midwest, not in a big city, have a home we bought June 2023 that has appreciated $45,000-50,000 since then at least). My wife and I are both government workers who will get a pension and make about $130,000 combined (my pay will max out at over 6 figs eventually) 

My wife is debt free as of a couple months ago and I have about $4,000 credit card debt. (I have a 1.3k tax refund coming so I’m still being positive) 

But I started sports gambling about 2021. It was bad, because back then cost of living was a tad lower, we had an apartment that was under $500 a month so even though I made less at that time I had a paid off 2011 car as well. I made $2600 month take home back then, so a lot of money to throw around (never was good at saving). I got into sports gambling, started with winning $20 parlays to turn into $350 etc. 

I made some decent investments in sports cards etc and made about 8-10k. We used this money to travel Europe where I proposed and I also started a side hustle (inflatable rental business company that I still run in summers, I don’t plan on growing it and only use it for side cash) 

I guess where my addiction was amplified was when i applied to get approved for an IDHA loan through my state (first time home buyer loan), they asked for bank statements. I applied in March of 2023. They denied me at that time saying “we see that up until March you’ve made $1800 sports gambling, we have to be fair with this loan and in our calculations we assume that you will be consistently winning $900 per month throughout the year which would push you over the income limit for the loan”

The lender told me I either need to wait until
June to reapply and not gamble at all till then so they won’t calculate future gambling winnings or to make a very large bet and lose on purpose.. so I made a $1,800 bet - 3 pick parlay on nba. I got lucky and that hit hit and paid me about $7,500. I took that money and used it for a down payment. We got the home inspected and will love our house. But the home inspector fucked us and on day one our ac/furnace wasn’t working which cost us $8500 total. 

I got into a tcg early and went to Gen con in Indiana and made some investments in that game early and made about 8-10k so we could pay it off. Around this time I started getting crazy with bets $300-1000 bets at a time on DraftKings. I’m still technically up, maybe 4k total. But I have recently banned myself from the sports betting apps because although I started betting smaller $25-50 bets I was going on a long losing streak and realized that I was spending more time looking at my parlays and tv to watch the game than not being present with those I love.

About 2 weeks ago I got into meme coins
My wife did warn me that it seems like what I’m doing is just something to replace my sports betting gambling. I started with $600 in SOL and built it into about 1k. My goal was to just build up to $1,200 to double my money and move stuff back into traditional crypto to help me pay off my $4,000 in credit card debt I have. 

About 2 weeks ago my brother (who invested $1,000 usd) and cousin (who invested $500 usd) got in early on a coin on Sol called $Ainti when it was announced at under 1 cent. 2 weeks ago Janice mcafee tweeted and the coin pumped up to $.42 cents - 100m market cap. My brother (who is kinda already rich) turned his $1,000 into $115,000 usd when he cashed out and my cousin (who’s broke and had debt) turned his $500 into about $75,000 usd. I guess this is what initially gravitated me toward phantom wallet. I tried telling my cousin it was luck and he would get pissed saying it was months of research (he’s only been in crypto since October 2024. 

I figured if they can’t 400x their money why can’t I 2x mine? 

The thing is, they did get lucky.. but I didn’t know it at the time.

I started with $600, turned it into $1,000 slowly. I played safe generally buying into coins wity $30-50 and getting out after making 20-30% increase or so

I also got rugged a couple times and lost money. I got rugged out of $600 yesterday and it.. hurt lol. The thing I didn’t realize is meme coins are way riskier than sports gambling even. It’s not other traders you are going up against. It’s scam artists. People constantly rug pulling 90% of projects and you don’t know when it will happen. 


I had fun with this, I’m not here trashing meme coins. Even though I lost, it was entertaining, but I’m now realizing this was just another scapegoat to replace me banning myself on sports apps. I gotta be done with both though lol. 

I guess some people get lucky and get that 1000x like my brother and cousin and maybe my luck will come later in life in some other way. lol. (I was on a 3 way phone call with them while their money was exploding up to $75,000 and $115,000 within 1.5-2 hours. I was happy for them, but also slightly jealous).

I’ve been putting paying off these credit cards for too long due to me not wanting to address them and pretend as if they’re not there.. so I will lay low and have a boring life until those are paid off now lol. ",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,solana,I want to code a bot and need to know if this strategy is viable.,2025-02-05 05:13:28,"Some backstory: I got really lucky with my Solana investment. I got in ridiculously early and have DCA'd into a really good position, more money than I would ever need to spend really. But now I want my solana to work for me. So I'm coding a simple bot. Thing is, I'm not a greedy man. I don't want to hit 100x on a meme coin or screw around and risk my Solana. I really just want a small, passive income to pay my bills with. So, essentially, my plan is to ""short"" my Solana through the daily ups and downs of the price. The bot I'm coding will simply take the price at the start of the day (4am) and convert my Solana to USDC, then every hour it will check the price, if it dips around 0.5% within that hour, it will convert the whole amount back to Solana, do a little calculation and then transfer the difference into a separate wallet. Leaving my original amount of Solana untouched. It will only do this once a day and only when it has reached its daily threshold of -0.5%. I don't need a lot of money. I live a very cheap existence, so I'm calculating I'd only need about £70-£100 a day to survive comfortably and pay my taxes. But is this viable? I've backtested a few weeks of Solana prices and it's looking doable. But I thought I should run it by you lot, to make sure.

Edit: Staking is not legal in the UK, so please don't point out that I could probably make just as much if I staked the Solana.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

I joined the industry a couple of weeks ago and started learning all about crypto and the blockchain technology.

All these sites take fees. And I learned trading with low amounts (like under 0.1 SOL makes you lose more money than make any profit)

How can I trade meme coins on blockchain directly to avoid those ridiculous fees ?

Reddit,solana,To all newcomers: BE VERY CAREFUL IN WHO YOU TRUST,2025-02-04 20:20:27,"Sooo, I'll start this by saying don't be retarded like me and NEVER, NEVER FUCKING EVER do what I just did. And I'm not a beginner, I'm in crypto since 2017, and in sol I'm a pumpfun dev since july last year. And I FUCKED UP. I FUCKED UP BADLY.

So in the beginning I had no idea what I'm doing, had no budget, managed to take 3 tokens to ray by livestreaming for days in a row, but only got more or less a breakeven on them cuz I spent most of the money on bumps, useless callers, botted kols, and so on. Anyway, at least I learned. I learned how to use a bumpbot, I learned how to set up the telegram bots, like d.raidbot, majorbuybot, safeguard, rose, I learned how to use trojan for buy and sell, how to do better website designs, animated banners, and so on. But most importantly, I met people that were in this game for a way longer time than me. Some of them I became friends with, others tried to scam me, others had a weird vibe, so I stayed away from them, and with some of them I started doing token launches together... What could go wrong, right?

Well, besides 3 real life friends that helped me with the launches (mostly to make profit from them, while I did most of the work... but that's another story) I met a few ok guys and we did some good launches together, they helped me as part of the team, with marketing funds, raiding, modding on tg, and I helped them on their launches too. With them, everything went fine and we're still keeping in touch even tho some of them quit pumpfun/sol because of the toxicity and overall bad nature of the space.

But I also met another guy... He helped a lot, not gonna lie, we talked now and then, he taught me some stuff, we did two great launches, one was a cto done after Ray, the other was an organic launch started on pumpfun, no bundle, nothing but the livestream, bumps and so on. On both of them he managed the marketing and funding (spent over 20 sols on each project, the cto even had a 500x boost), he used Fatality, he spent for trendings, kols, and so on. Meanwhile, I handled the twitter raids, telegram modding, hyping up the people and I also livestreamed on thelaunches. So I started to trust him. He was always the guy willing to do marketing and make a project work, he had the marketing experience and money, while I handled the people interaction and modding aspect, and was the face of the project. There's no way he would scam me, right? Right?

Well, it all started to go downhill in late November I think... He kept talking about launches not working anymore, and using his ""custom made futures bot"" to trade on Binance (I knew the guy works in cybersec and builds his own bots, so I believed him), so I sent him 2 sol so he can trade them, and make me a bit of extra profit to use for future launches and so on. Anyway, left him that money to trade... Then before Christmas, he told me that he made 3 sols profit, so I had 5 sols, but Binance had locked his funds, and showed me screenshots from the discussions with the customer support, etc. Sent him 4 sols to buy presents for family and stuff, cuz he told me his funds are locked and he can't buy anything and he's desperate. That should have been a big red flag (that he still had my 2 sols + asked for more) but I'm retarded, emotional, I trust and try to help people I know sometimes and he seemed desperate... Then I said that maybe, after he fixes the binance stuff, he might trade the other \~10 ish sols I had, to make an x2-x3, and to use the money for some bigger launches... I was greedy, I was retarded, I didn't think straight... He told me he can't use binance, but he can trade with another bot made by him that makes less profit... 

Sent him the money, and kept 0.6 sol for myself, to have for the new years eve and so on. He told me to tell him the exact dates when I need the money+profit back, so he knows when to send them... Told him to send me 3 sols on 3-4 Jan, cuz I had to go to the dentist the week after that, and to send me another 4 or 5 sols on 12 jan, so I can pay my rent and bills on 15... And that's when he started with the bullshit.

  
He kept delaying and delaying, saying that he can't send the money because they're stuck with some other guy, and that guy is busy and will come back in a few days (he sent me screenshots, probably fake ones where he talked to himself on another account...). And he kept delaying... I canceled my dentist appointment. I got left with \~7$, and I had to ask some friends for money to buy food. I had to ask the landlord to postpone my rent for the next week. I had 3 major mental breakdowns, on one of them I went nuts and sent 1370 messages to the guy, while I was crying and swinging between wanting to punch walls or jump off the window and kms :/ He kept saying that he's gonna send the money, soon, it's gonna be fixed, while I was slowly losing my fucking mind.

Eventually I paid the rent using the security deposit from the landlord, but I had to move out cuz I couldn't pay the rent anymore... Some friends helped me with food, a bit of money, and now I moved into a friends place, I'm staying in their living room for a while, until I figure out what to do next. Most likely I'll try to launch a token and try to recover some of the lost money, and then try to slowly climb up the ladder and try to get out of the trenches once again.

Soo yeah, be super careful in who you trust...

Anyway, TL;DR: lost everything cuz I got scammed by a guy that I trusted, I did launches together with him, he always had money, so I didn't think he would go that low and scam me... It's a reason they're called the trenches, everyone is out to get you unfortunately :/

Also, I'll attach some screenshots with the conversations if I can, maybe it will help other people not to fall for scams like these:

In other words, I want to go through some service like Myetherwallet into my wallet and put my full name next to the address, as well as with the opportunity to show in the service itself a transaction originating in the past, and regarding it, so that the screen shows that the wallet belongs to me.

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?


Thx for your responses mates.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,ethereum,🚀 Major Update: Wanchain’s ETH XFlows Now Integrated with Polygon zkEVM! 🚀,2025-02-03 14:56:23,"https://preview.redd.it/mnxzuga2uxge1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=930d2fb712a78a211091fca9262c13d3acd8fdb9

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to encrypt data inside a smart contract on Ethereum?,2025-01-30 22:00:52,"Hello, everyone!

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

So, my question is: is there any way to encrypt data within Ethereum using another person's public key, whether with RSA, ECC, or some other approach? Has anything been developed to achieve this?",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

I have always sort of understood what they are but not completely. These other tokens on Ethereum like a gaming coin like axie infinity or any of the hot AI Coin’s are basically smart contracts that have been given their own tokens? 

Bitcoin and XRP have way smaller ecosystems because they don’t have smart contracts so they don’t have a reason to have all those tokens? 

If this is correct, are smart contracts always tokenized? Or are there smart contracts that can be carried out in Ethereum alone?",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Meanwhile two people of my class magically somehow appear announce events about web3 blockchain etc etc and I'm not sure how they started getting funding for it. They went to Bangalore for some meetup, conducted some meetups in my city and now they arr going to eth denver, one of them posted about the visa approval and tickets to the event. I was stunned. I talked to them and they have become literally so arrogant about giving information, and said they don't give a fuck to studies of college. I'm not sure what they are doing to achieve so but for student like me willing to study hard, and earn success gets insecure about not knowing everything hi fi going [around.Read](http://around.Read) more

Reddit,ethereum,I've created a Game and hidden seed words throughout it.,2025-01-25 10:07:53,"Hi reddit, I challenge you all.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

We hope you love it and have a nice day. **�**�",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO.

 * Decentralized Applications (dApps): From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming and beyond, Ethereum empowers developers to build innovative dApps that are secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship.  
 * A Thriving Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts a vibrant and active community of developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

I want to start out by saying I am sorry for this post. I have somewhere between .5-1 BTC sitting on an exchange. I’ve been DCA’ing for several years now. And I am absolutely *terrified* to move it off the exchange. 

I know I need to do it. I see the constant comments about supply shock and the rapid removal from BTC from exchanges. I know mine isn’t safe where it is. 

The problem is, I’m so scared to move it. I work in tech, and I’m still not comfortable moving it. Then to top it all off, I have the memory of a fish. I’m scared I’ll lose my keys.. even though I do have several backup plans for those. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this initial fear? I just can’t be the only one who feels this way… 

Anyone who also faced this same issue want to share what worked to make you comfortable doing this? 

Anyone who DM’s me is going to get blocked. I read this sub like the morning paper and I’m overly cautious of being scammed (outside of my BTC staying on the exchange)🤡",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

I paid off all my debts and started aggressively saving towards my 401k and bout 0.1 BTC and some other crypto that rounded out to 5k , put It on a ledger and did not make any new moves until late 2024 and I’m shocked because that has out paced my 401k. Now I only save in Sats, rotate profits out of other cryptos into my BTC savings and now I’ve convinced my dad to save in BTC instead of dumping money into a high yielding savings account.

Reddit,bitcoin,Why HODL of Bitcoin is still the move 🚀💰,2025-02-07 00:25:43,"Yes, it's volatile. Yes, there are ups and downs. But every time the price dips, it’s just a chance to **buy more** and hold for the future. **Bitcoin has consistently proven to rise over time**, despite all the noise around it.

Here’s the simple truth: **Bitcoin is scarce**, and as more people adopt it and demand increases, its price will continue to appreciate. We’ve seen this pattern before and it’s only going to continue as the world shifts towards digital assets.

So, if you’re holding Bitcoin, don’t worry about the short-term fluctuations. **Patience is key**. The people who held through the bear markets of 2017-2018, or the crash in 2020, were rewarded handsomely. The future looks even brighter with more institutional adoption, global economic uncertainty, and growing demand for decentralized finance.

Long-term holding isn't just a strategy – it’s a **commitment to the future of money**. And in the end, Bitcoin will likely be worth far more than we can imagine today. Remember the post in 2035.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Two chains diverged in a silent block,
And sorry I could not follow both,
Through cryptic paths where miners dock,
And hash with silent, steady troth.

I watched the ledger’s lines unfold,
Immutable as fallen frost,
Where every trade was weighed in gold,
Yet no man saw the true cost.

A block was signed, a price was set,
And yet the road kept winding far—
For each who held, one more who bet,
Chasing some celestial star.

And so I stood where markets sway,
Between belief and cold distrust,
Two chains diverged, and who can say
Which one would turn to dust.



So When two chains diverged in the silent night,
I took the one that gleamed more clear,
Where blocks were formed in the pale moonlight,
And miners labored without fear.

The whispers spoke of wealth untold,
Of ledgers wide and futures bright,
Where every coin, once bought or sold,
Could shape the dawn of clearer sight.

The road was long, the path unsure,
Yet something in the air was new,
A promise held—of ways more pure,
Where trust is built from code, not few.

And though the world may turn and twist,
This light will guide the steps I take,
For in the crypto mist I’ve kissed,
A future bright, for all’s sake.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,bitcoin,BTC 2048: Hyperbitcoinization Op-ed,2025-02-06 23:53:51,"Alright, while '*hyperbitcoinization*' is not a rigidly defined term, I wanted to take a look at a potential world that has fully embraced Bitcoin, let's take a quick glance at what the world could look like in the year 2048; within many of our lifetimes.

# Setting the Stage

Bitcoin is now approaching 40 years old. It has not had any downtime in almost four decades, quietly chugging along as each subsequent block is added to the blockchain - which is now approaching 2.1 million blocks in length.

Miners earning multiple Bitcoin per block is a distant memory, as each block now creates less than 0.1 BTC in newly minted coin - ***just about 14 BTC per day for the whole network.*** This makes sense though because everyone is acutely aware of the fact that the 'last bitcoin' will be mined in the year 2140, still a whole lifetime away at this point, and yet there are already 20,980,000 Bitcoin in existence. **That's only 20,000 Bitcoin left to mine for the next** ***90 years.***

https://preview.redd.it/t8vfm00uwlhe1.png?width=2176&format=png&auto=webp&s=51d723b3a89491b8a6356bcb74fe68219efab50e

With the dwindling block reward, half of miner revenue is now earned via transaction fees. An inflection point within Bitcoin economics, as the mining reward will only continue to decrease from here.

As a result, a fight for space on the base chain has created an unofficial hierarchy of the types of transactions and data that are worthy of being confirmed on the almighty blockchain. Lets take a closer look at what kind of usage it has, as well as the alternatives that are available.

# Blockchain Usage & Scalability

>BASE LAYER USAGE

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for Banks**

Banks transacting with each other domestically and internationally, via other second-order banks or via their country's central bank, are some of the biggest players using on-chain transactions. These banks have replaced SWIFT and other means of transacting value with the immutability of Bitcoin. These are some of the largest Bitcoin denominated transactions on the network, still regularly transferring 5-digit sums of Bitcoin between key players.

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for Governments**

As more governments got on board, their collective investments in Bitcoin within their sovereign wealth funds also grew. While many of the big economic players from the 2020s still hold most of the Bitcoin, smaller nations like Bhutan that were able to jump-on early were able to see their wealth grow immensely relative to nations that were their size a few decades ago. These nations have the ability to transact on the base chain either via paying the necessary fees, or by having domestic government-owned mining operations prioritize including their transactions in their own blocks.

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for the Wealthy**

The wealthy are still find it economically feasibly to conduct more of their important transactions on the base chain. They can afford the luxury of doing so, and this is looked on favourably by the recipient as the highest-form of receiving Bitcoin.

* **Bitcoin As Final Settlement for Data**

But Bitcoin hasn't been solely moving assets for decades now - many transactions on the Blockchain now exist as a means to move and store immutable *data.* This has allowed the Bitcoin network to act as a **Proof of Truth** for important government and corporate entities.

The 2030s saw chaos as AI-generated deepfakes of leaders and executives flooded social media, fuelling propaganda and nearly triggering wars. A solution: governments used verified Bitcoin multi-sig addresses to cryptographically sign messages and store document hashes on the blockchain, enabling news outlets and the public to instantly verify authenticity—leveraging Bitcoin’s immutability as a global trust layer.

* **Mass Consolidations**

Growing blockchain usage and the rise of second-layer solutions have increased UTXO fragmentation, forcing large entities to periodically consolidate their fragmented UTXOs via costly on-chain transactions. Due to high fees (driven by the massive number of UTXO inputs).

>SECOND LAYER USAGE

Many consumers have been pushed off-chain to second-layer solutions for most of their transactions. This is split amongst many different solutions, across a **spectrum of centralization**.

* **Lightning Network and Others**

While Lightning nodes remain the most decentralized second-layer solution, they exist on a spectrum of centralization. Wealthier individuals may own personal nodes, but in developed regions, families commonly share a node—akin to households sharing a single Wi-Fi connection in the past. Modern Lightning nodes are now user-friendly, with many ISPs bundling node services into modem/router packages. Families optimize costs by pooling Lightning channels, enabling a single on-chain transaction to open/close channels collectively.

Developing nations may also use this shared channel approach, but for entire communities rather than per family. It makes much more sense when a single on-chain transaction can cost the equivalent of a single individual's monthly income in some poorer parts of the world.

This results in a hierarchy of centralization, where consumers that are less well off may have to resort to lightning channels that are run by a third party to partake in the network.

* **Custodial Services**

Custodial services, while sometimes heavily criticized on this sub, remain essential for users unprepared to self-custody their Bitcoin securely—particularly those that are technologically inept. Institutions like Goldman Sachs fill this niche by offering trusted custodial wallets, acting as a safety net against scams and hacks that could irreversibly drain someone's funds. These services enable broader participation in Bitcoin, ensuring even the most vulnerable users can safely use BTC.

# Bitcoin Mining & Incentivization Structure

Governments holding significant Bitcoin reserves are increasingly motivated to secure large hashrate positions on the network to prevent adversarial control over an asset they heavily rely on. This nation-state dick measuring contest to dominate hashrate inadvertently creates unbeatable network security for all participants. Regardless of intent, the collective 'hashrate arms race' result is a win-win.

As a result, many government miners do not care as much about the revenue of mining, and can often mine Bitcoin at a loss, because that is a secondary byproduct to their main objective - **securing the network for their existing stack**.

By-product mining has emerged as a key method for individuals and small businesses to earn Bitcoin economically by repurposing mining heat for practical uses (e.g., heating homes, greenhouses). This approach also provides **non-KYC coins**, which are highly valued due to their privacy benefits and scarcity in today’s regulated landscape.

# Bitcoin As a Unit of Account

With the volatility of Bitcoin having dampened and more-or less is as volatile as the Forex market, it has become feasible for retail to **price their goods in both BTC** as well as local fiat currency without fear of the Bitcoin price drastically changing by the next day. In fact, in some countries they fear that their local currency is the more volatile of the pair.

It has become commonplace for things to be valued in BTC. **One of the first major things to be denominated in Bitcoin was the stock market** in 2034. This was a perfect fit for Bitcoin because it required no need for a perfectly stable Bitcoin price - and with so many corporations holding Bitcoin in their corporate treasury, it actually correlated with the market better as a whole.

**Wages and salaries have been increasingly paid in BTC** as demand for it grew, tech companies and others that wanted to attract the best talent start offering it as an option for Sign-on Bonuses and Performance Bonuses first, and eventually began to offer the option to accept wages in it. First indirectly via third party payment processing companies, and then directly through an internal payroll solution.

# Bitcoin Whales

Being a '**whole-coiner**' individual is now seen as a unattainable pipe-dream for most. Most Sovereign Nations, regions, and institutions hold Bitcoin in their reserves. The first-movers of the bunch, MSTR, El Salvador, Bhutan, and others have seen their leap of faith paid off as they comparatively outperform their counterparts over the past few decades.

Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE have more or less begun to heavily shift their economies away from one that is totally dependent on oil. With massive sovereign wealth funds needing to be allocated, these entities have **sought partial refuge in Bitcoin** and accumulated over a million BTC combined.

# Bitcoin Financial Services

Many financial tools and instruments are now built on-top of Bitcoin. **Bitcoin loans** have become commonplace, but lending is much more stringent than it was years prior. With the inability to print money, the cost of debt has likewise gone up. Lenders are much more selective to those they choose worthy of their Bitcoin. This effects the start-up industry the hardest as Venture Capital struggles to exist on a Bitcoin Standard.

# Fiat in 2050

**US National Debt has hit a record quarter-quadrillion dollars** ($250T). A household debt equivalent of $2.5M per family. Interest payments on this debt now exceed $10 Trillion per year, or 20% of national expenditures.

https://preview.redd.it/rpkarpjxwlhe1.png?width=2176&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c165a191342e969e7188cb39ddc925049eab8c9

At the microeconomic scale, the median American family brings in an equivalent of $400,000 annually, or approximately $100,000 in 2025 dollars, as CPI has increased at a CAGR of approximately **6%** over the last two decades - exacerbated by the money printer and nation state adoption of BTC.

Your average Family vacation costs **$13,000 USD.**

An average car will run you **$110,000 USD.**

A meal for one at McDonalds will cost **$77 USD.**

# Auxiliary Effects

* **The Effect on War** **and Conflict**

Without the ability to print the money necessary to fight in an unjustified war, nations around the world are much more picky as to the conflicts they choose to partake in (I say nations as a plural, but we all know who specifically). Justified conflicts find it easy to fundraise via war bonds sold to the public, but long-gone are the days of printing the equivalent double digit percentages of the GDP overnight to afford a war.

* **The Effect on Traditional Store of Value Assets**

Purchasing gold, or your seventh or eighth empty condo (*Looking at you Chinese R.E market*) in order to store your wealth is no longer the norm amongst the elite. With the ability to save in BTC, these assets become more attainable for industry (in the case of gold in electronics), or more attainable for homebuyers that don't need to compete with mega-corporations to buy their starter homes. This drastically reduces the price of real estate in places that got out of control in the late 2020's.

# Obstacles Beyond 2048

At this point, we can see even farther into the future than we could decades ago. New potential issues that will need to be overcome have begun to surface.

Reddit,bitcoin,Concerns about BTC systemic adoption,2025-02-06 21:19:32,"Hi everyone! Just bought my first fractions of BTC about one month ago. I have some concerns regarding the possible wide adoption of BTC and wanted to talk about them here. People here are as biased as you can be, but I hope I will be able to discuss about this in depth. Disclaimer: I am new to this, and might say wrong stuff. If so, please correct me kindly.

Here are my points:

1• **Since the beginning of society people always had their assets managed by others.** Having our assets in physical form (gold, jewelry, now wallet) is unreliable and dangerous as we can easily loose them. The average guy does not want to have the mental charge of risking to loose the entirety of his assets for a single bad move. I agree that the central institutions are bad etc, but they offer a certain protection against attacks (you’re not going to loose money if the bank gets robbed for example). You can loose everything only in very extreme cases, which for me happens way less than forgetting a seed phrase. So, the average Joe is not putting everything on BTC because of how scared he is, except if there is a « bitcoin bank » of some sort. Which repeats the cycle of centralized institutions for me, since the bank controls the money.

2• **Everything relies on the BTC protocol.** If this protocol gets broken, EVERYONE LOOSES EVERYTHING. This would not be like a single bank going bankrupt, this would be THE ENTIRE SYSTEM COLLAPSING over a single broken protocol. Which is very scary to think about.

**TLDR:** Managing your own assets is dangerous, and centralizing the worlds’s assets on one single protocol is even more.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

The original goal was to make money so I didn't have to work anymore and retire early.

Well exceeded that goal, the funny thing is I can't bring myself to sell any of it because the more I've learned about Bitcoin and the traditional fiat debt slave inflationary system, the more I've realised that selling out of Bitcoin for fiat currencies or any other traditional asset is a losing game against inflation..

But when does it end? You can't earn a yield or an income from Bitcoin. You are sitting there with amazing numbers on the screen and still live like a peasant. I've considered selling up to 50% of my stack but obviously timing would be hard in this bull run. Ladder selling would be the best way.

I've run the numbers on selling Bitcoin and diversifying into other assets vs 100% holding Bitcoin and honestly nothing beats BTC.

If you earn even a 5% yield on another asset it still loses out to true inflation which is minimum 7% a year.

I am by no means asking for financial advice and will do plenty of my own research, but I am considering selling off some of my assets in order to reach 0.1 BTC (21 million club is out of reach, but this is the next best for me)

To finance this , I would sell off;

* \~0.03btc of Pokemon cards I bought as investments over the last years
* \~0.04btc worth of S&P 500 

And acquire the remaining \~0.015 with cash I have spare, and this would result in me having approx 50% of my net worth in Bitcoin.  I would continue to retain just under half of my S&P and just under half of my Pokemon investments and enough cash for emergencies. While it would be a kick in the teeth, it's money I can afford to lose. However, a lot of you are smarter than me and wanted to seek any other opinions/advice.

Is it for maximum gains? How can you be so sure ? Sure based on past history, it will always be bull->bear->accumulation->halving->bull and repeat. I think those patterns are obsolete, things have changed now, institutions and Governments are here so it can be a long long bullrun

So what you can do, set a portfolio management that suits you and keep getting money either from playing a little percentage of alt coins or meme coins and put the profit back to bitcoin and you will do fine :)

Reddit,bitcoin,DIY air-gapped wallet,2025-02-06 21:10:36,"I am looking for an air-gapped setup for cold storage and signing transactions offline. After reviewing the possibilities, I have come down to the following setup.

Realme 8 5g with Adroid. Install Electrum and AirGap vault apps, remove wifi/bluetooth and SIM modules (hardware remove).

Generate 24 word + passphrase wallet on the now air-gapped phone, generate corresponding watch only wallet on laptop.

**Usage:** Use watch only wallet to check balance and generate transactions, pass to Realme wallet via QR code, sign, and pass back signed transaction via QR. Watch only will broadcast the transactions.

**Bonus:** with Electrum, I can set up my own multi-sig (2 over 3 sounds easy). With AirGap Vault I can have a separate wallet for smaller amounts.

Notes: Why Realme 8 5g? because I have a spare one. In any case, if the phone gets broken, I can still access the wallets on a new device with the words and passphrase.

Why going through these steps?

These are some of the alternatives I have seen:

1. Similar setup, but replace Realme setup with bootable USB, Tails OS. Props if it does not have persistence. PROBLEMS WITH THIS SETUP: I need a separate PC laptop to boot the OS, and need to import the wallet every time I want to use it (well actually this second one is not bad :D ).
2. Trezor 3 Safe and many more HW wallets. Easy to setup and use. PROBLEM WITH THIS SETUP: Most HW wallets I have seen connects via USB, or use a microSD to pass the transaction to sign.

Reddit,bitcoin,On the origins of money,2025-02-06 20:42:16,"In most Bitcoin and Austrian econ books it is assumed that money emerged as a solution to the double coincidence of wants in barter trade and the whole argument for Bitcoin as a better form of money is derived from that. The problem with this origin story is that it doesn't seem to be rooted in facts. The archeological studies to date weren't able to find any real world barter economies that worked before money supposedly emerged. The findings seem to suggest that most pre-money economies were gift economies where trades were not economically optimal.

There's a lengthy article by David Graeber on this issue to be read [here](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/david-graeber-on-the-invention-of-money-%E2%80%93-notes-on-sex-adventure-monomaniacal-sociopathy-and-the-true-function-of-economics.html).

The problem I have with his arguments is that he describes a gift economy as a small scale exchange of goods and favors where there's a degree of trust between individuals and implied reciprocation, but it's not really gifting if you expect something in return in the future. It's credit and, for any non-trivial value exchange, it only makes sense if you can reasonably expect it to be paid back. This won't work for trade between strangers or different tribes and Graeber describes a barter system with a ritual social layer on top of it, arguing that the ritual was just as important as the exchange itself. On the other hand, he concedes that there were more or less fixed exchange ratios in those trades.

>As a result, as Chris Gregory observed, what you ordinarily find in such ‘gift economies’ is a broad ranking of different types of goods—canoes are roughly the same as heirloom necklaces, both are superior to pigs and whale teeth, which are superior to chickens, etc—but no system whereby you can measure how many pigs equal one canoe.

This completely ignores the marginal theory of value, though. While a canoe might be worth roughly the same as a heirloom necklace, a second or third canoe will probably be worth less than their equivalent in heirloom necklaces if you don't need additional canoes. You could be incentivized to trade your necklaces for a good that you would be able to easily trade with someone else later, but that implies the existence of a most salable good, which would simply mean the good that is accepted by the most people and trade would probably converge around it eventually. That leads back to the Austrian origin story of money, though. If it doesn't then it leads to the double coincidence of wants problem, because the person with the canoes would have to find someone who would have something you value and trade their canoes for it before they trade with you.

Also, the existence of a ""broad ranking of goods"" in terms of their value implies that all goods should have more than one trading pair. If so, then for any two goods there probably exists a series of exchanges through other goods where a rough exchange rate between A and B could be established. The shorter the exchange path, the less lossy the exchange rate, which implies that as more goods become available it becomes increasingly more convenient to converge on a singular unit of account and that again leads us back to the Austrian origin story of money.

Graeber also points out that there is evidence that money was created through legislation as a unit of account for compensation and accounting. This also leads to convergence of exchange rates to the rates defined by law and the legislated units being broadly used for value expression eventually. On the other hand, if market exchange ratios diverge significantly from the exchange rates defined by law, the law would probably be amended to reflect the new fair compensation value.

My opinion is that what Graeber describes as gift economies can only work in relatively small trusted communities and that outside of those communities trade was done through barter (even if the barter was ritualized as described and had an additional social layer attached to it). Moreover, even if we concede that money did not emerge organically and was initially created by non-state administrations as Graeber claims, it would make sense for merchants to eventually adopt it as a universal unit of account, since the exchange would be deemed fair by law and it's much simpler to trade with fewer intermediate goods involved.

It's also my opinion that even if we concede all of Graeber's points, the scale of the current world economy needs money for trade to happen. Therefore, even if money didn't emerge from the free market, competing forms of money exist now and are subject to free market dynamics. The Austrian arguments for why markets should converge on a superior form of money when multiple exist still seem sound to me.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Finding Out About Crypto Ruined My Life,2025-02-06 23:33:56,"Let me preface this by saying that as someone with an engineering degree I’m a complete idiot. 

I learned about crypto while I was in college in 2017. Funny enough my classmate told me about bitcoin in 2015 when it was $400 and I laughed it off as broke college kid. Anyway, 2017, I became obsessed and I had my phase of telling everyone I knew about crypto and that they should buy.

I managed to turn a few hundred bucks into 10 grand. As someone who’s been a lazy procrastinator my whole life this new thing was my golden ticket out of needing to work ever again. Of course I didn’t sell anything before it disappeared.

By 2020 I had almost forgot about my bag. By 2021 I felt like a genius again and “knew” I was right. I still never pulled out cash, if I sold, it was to buy other coins and you know how that went. It’s 2025 now and I’m tired. I’m tired of what crypto has done to my mental health. 

These crazy crypto swings have made it so I’m entirely not grounded with money. What’s $500 when we’re seeing $5k swings (and never selling, just eating poopoo). 

That’s not even the best part, because don’t forget as lazy person the idea of one day becoming a crypto millionaire (so hopeful) is a great way to kill your career ambitions. Now here we are, crypto is finally gaining some traction in the real world and I’m not a millionaire no where close, my job is shit, and I got a ton of debt. 

Don’t be like me. Don’t romanticize your gains. Work hard in your life as if crypto is going to zero. I’m sure many of you will think this nonsense doesn’t apply to you. It does. Anyway I welcome the chat to shit on my and/or make me feel better. Thanks. 


Edit: Bear with me I said I studied maths, I’m not a writer. I’m still in profit. I have a mains bag and a memes bag. I don’t blame crypto. I am blaming myself, my point was with my personality finding something like this was a bad bad thing for me. 

I didn’t even consider the market being a little down right now writing this post. It was more so the stress of things outside crypto and dwelling on how I got here that made me write this now. Those choices made it so my unrealized gains aren’t as life changing. Hopefully this helps some people from making the same wrong choices.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,It’s genuinely disappointing how few people care about the actual technology anymore,2025-02-07 03:39:33,"Been here since 2016 and everyone used to follow the technology, and you could have great conversations about what technology is the best. Regardless of what subreddit you posted in. People were interested in discussing a chains current upgrades, or open to discussion on what they could work on, and what other chains were leading the way.

Now unfortunately you make any post remotely trying to discuss issues with a chain’s technology, or compare one chain’s technology to another, and that post is going to be obliterated. 

Personally as a software engineer I think Polakdots JAM upgrade is really important for the industry. And I frequently try to get insight into why other people think their chain of choice will have the best technology. 

But literally all you see now is “dead chain”, “look at price”, “look at how fast our transaction are”… like totally fine I get it most people are here for the gains now. But all the subreddits are essentially run by them now, and its impossible to have a solid discussion about the state of the technology

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Humanity needs a cryptocurrency that is ""mined"" by doing good deeds.",2025-02-07 08:38:18,"Obviously I've no idea how that would work. It's a thought experiment more than anything, but it's exactly what is needed. 

The more valuable it becomes, the more incentive there is to do good. In times of national or international strife, the value would supposedly rise, to encourage more positive actions. 

At some point it might even be useful to consider making this the basis store of value, since ""scarcity"" like gold is kinda silly, and ""arbitrary"" value like btc that is able to be manipulated by financial interest alone means that the rich continue to benefit more significantly than ""normal"" people. 

It would have to be one-directional tradable though, or something. Or only able to be purchased (or burned) by institutions delivering programs. 

Or awarded by consensus of others, with the scarcity of your awarding determining the strength of your vote to award. (To prevent people forming a group and just awarding each other back and forth). 

And penalties could be leveraged against institutions or govts that commit bad actions, like polluting a river, tearing down a forest, or, say, displacing an entire population from their residences. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

In fact the system could be entirely sentimental, where people contribute and vote for activities they see as good or bad. 

This is just brainstorm, no idea how any of it would work obviously. The idea though fundamentally would be to provide a counter to raw profiteering - some kind of social accountability for both good and bad. 

And now I realise this sounds exactly like ""social credit"" so obviously it would have to be designed to address the flaws in those systems heh.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Best Crypto Based on Priority,2025-02-07 05:48:10,"The “best” cryptocurrency depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown based on different priorities:

1. Best for Stability & Store of Value:

Bitcoin (BTC) – As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is widely regarded as “digital gold.” It has the highest market capitalization, institutional adoption, and a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it a solid long-term store of value.

2. Best for Fast & Cheap Transactions:

XRP (Ripple) – Known for its speed and low transaction fees, XRP is designed for cross-border payments and bank partnerships. If regulation clears up in its favor, it could see significant institutional adoption.

3. Best for Smart Contracts & Decentralized Finance (DeFi):

Ethereum (ETH) – The leading blockchain for DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. While gas fees can be high, Ethereum 2.0 upgrades aim to improve scalability and reduce costs.

4. Best for Privacy:

Monero (XMR) – If privacy is a priority, Monero is the best option, as it offers untraceable transactions. However, regulatory concerns around privacy coins could pose challenges.

5. Best for Low Fees & High Scalability:

Solana (SOL) – A fast and scalable blockchain with low fees, often considered an “Ethereum killer.” However, it has experienced network outages.

6. Best for Institutional Adoption & Regulations:

Ripple (XRP) & Ethereum (ETH) – With banks and governments exploring blockchain technology, these two are often considered the most likely to gain regulatory approval and institutional backing.

7. Best for Passive Income (Staking & Yield Farming):
	•	Cardano (ADA) – Uses proof-of-stake for secure and energy-efficient staking.
	•	Ethereum (ETH) – After its transition to proof-of-stake, you can stake ETH for rewards.
	•	Cosmos (ATOM) – Offers staking with decent yields and interoperability with other blockchains.

8. Best for Emerging Growth & AI Integration:
	•	Fetch.ai (FET) – A leader in AI-integrated blockchain solutions.
	•	Internet Computer (ICP) – Aims to decentralize cloud computing and web services.

Final Thoughts:
	•	For long-term holding (store of value): Bitcoin (BTC)
	•	For smart contracts & DeFi: Ethereum (ETH)
	•	For fast & cheap transactions: XRP or Solana (SOL)
	•	For privacy: Monero (XMR)
	•	For staking/yield farming: Cardano (ADA) & Cosmos (ATOM)

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"If alternative cryptocurrency coins and tokens fail to make it past their all-time highs by the end of 2025, the 4 year super cycle will officially be broken.",2025-02-06 12:09:55,"Every four years or 12 to 18 months post Bitcoin's most recent Halvening we have entered into a cryptocurrency super cycle. 2025 marks the 4-year range after the last super cycle in 2021, and so far, the old alternative cryptocurrency coin and token darlings have failed to break past their all-time highs.

From 2013 to 2017 Bitcoin increased by 17,492%, from 2017 to 2021 Bitcoin increased by 252%, and so far, Bitcoin has increased by just 62% from 2021 to 2025, so this alone proves that the chances of you getting rich off of a Bitcoin investment without access to millions of dollars to invest is not happening.

With that being said, we plebes look to Bitcoin's cheaper alternatives to achieve wealth beyond our wildest dreams, but will they actually increase enough in 2025 to get us there is the ultimate question?

One of the issues we currently face nowadays that has been keeping me up at night is all the big players now taking money out of the pot. Heck, we even have the President of the United States himself throwing his coin in the ring, along with his old lady’s meme coin to boot!

The issue here is that all the dumb money is now so overly saturated, so that useless and worthless coin you and I decided to invest in months or even years ago may never suck in enough of that dumb money to pump it to the Moon and beyond.

We need these dummies. They serve as exit liquidity to inevitably enrich ourselves, because let's be real here, this is the only reason why any of us buy meme coins to begin with am I right?

Fast forward to today though, and we have players like Solana, which grants the ability for any thot and their pimp such as the Hawk Tuah Girl to create a coin, have some shady somewhat smart people market it, and then rug all the dummies who thought they would get rich off it, then rinse and repeat.

This is a problem see, because all of that dumb money is drying up, plus if you could believe it, some of these dummies actually learn their lesson and actually stop investing in dumb projects... which becomes our problem in the end.

I'll leave you all with a question: Will 2025 be another cryptocurrency super cycle year, or is the real money made these days strictly by creating, promoting, and rugging the mentally challenged?",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Take back control, learn, align, and gradually reinvest in crypto with purpose",2025-02-07 11:32:13,"Investing in crypto can feel overwhelming, especially when emotions and market volatility take over. But what if you stepped back and gave yourself a chance to reset? Start by asking yourself these fundamental questions: Why am I in the cryptosphere? What values brought me here? Are my investments aligned with these values and goals? 

Here's a suggestion, pause, reflect, and use this as an opportunity to rebuild your portfolio with intention.

Step out completely, consider selling everything, converting your investments back into your local currency. This can help you reset emotionally and clear any biases tied to your current portfolio.

Dedicate time to knowledge, commit 100 hours to fully understanding the space. Read white papers, blue papers, and yellow papers. Explore the products, dive into the code if possible, and spend time engaging with communities. Learn the history and technical aspects of projects so you can evaluate them for what they truly are, not what the marketing tells you they are.

Breadcrumb your way back in. For every hour you spend enriching your understanding, allow yourself to reinvest just 1% of your stack. This gradual approach gives you time to think critically and make informed decisions about how to allocate your net worth across multiple projects.

Slowly reinvesting also allows you to observe how your values align with your investments. For example, are you prioritizing decentralization? Utility? Innovation? Use your values as your compass, not market hype.

Own your decisions. As you rebuild your portfolio, make choices based on your own criteria. Don't trust anyone's advice blindly, not even mine. Trust in the knowledge you've gained and the research you've done. If you don't think for yourself, the market will think for you, and you'll always be at its mercy.

This approach isn't about abandoning crypto, it's about taking back control. By stepping out, educating yourself, and gradually reinvesting, you give yourself the freedom to think clearly, align your portfolio with your goals, and make informed decisions that truly represent your values.

So, Redditors, how would you allocate those 100 hours? 50 hours reading on the top 5 biggest and 50 hours on the other remaining 95? what would your spread look like?

There's only so many coins one can actually *read* about, how to know which ones to investigate deeper vs where to simply fall in line with current social/market consensus?",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,DeFi's Subtle Shift: Who Would Have Thought?,2025-02-07 07:59:17,"Alright, let's talk DeFi without sounding like I'm trying to sell you something. Recently, there's been some buzz around how AI is starting to play a bigger role in making DeFi less of a puzzle.

Imagine a setup where staking your tokens could be as straightforward as setting up a direct deposit for your paycheck but with the potential for much more significant returns. There's this new approach where instead of juggling multiple platforms, everything's streamlined into one spot, making the whole process less of a brain teaser.

And these reward systems? They're getting creative, offering boosts in ways that were less common before. It's like the DeFi scene is quietly shifting towards making things more user-friendly, where you don't need to be a crypto wizard to get the most out of your investments.

It's an interesting development, seeing how trad DeFi complexities are being tackled with tech that feels almost... intuitive. Just an observation of how the landscape is changing, becoming more accessible, and possibly more rewarding for everyone involved.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

A) Salvage what’s left and rotate into BTC/stocks?

B) Hold out and hope they eventually recover

Have not been active at all for quite some time. After a few weeks back of lurking I have to say that It feels like so many former eth enthusiasts chase the memecoin for the crazy gains nowadays. I am still here for the tech. 

But if you have hate for eth because of whatever and don’t feel justified in selling cause that would turn those unrealized losses into realized ones, than I might have a solution. 

I can take on the burden of holding eth like Kyle did it with credit card dept in Southpark. 

There would be no need to dm me and I have nothing of real matter to say in this space. But that one think I feel I can do for you guys so this space can start thriving again. 

No regard should hold an established coin in the industry with no gains to show for so here it is.

For anyone not familiar with them, a major service they provide is allowing people to remit money with relative ease, especially in underbanked or under-served communities. To me their business represents a huge area that crypto solves.  

If we all knew how to store and use crypto overnight their business wouldn’t be necessary. However, they are much simpler than crypto, and I think they fill a niche that will always exist. I don’t often listen to their earnings calls, but someone essentially asked how they will deal with competition from things such as cryptocurrency.  

Their response was effectively that they are exploring ways to legally and effectively settle funds via crypto. This will reduce float in the system, and speed up inefficiencies of using the traditional swift based banking system to move money and settle transactions. Those are their words. The answer was very well thought out IMO and it makes me excited.  

It could very well be that this particular company doesn’t figure out how to implement this, but I see them as a dinosaur company, and the fact that they are interested in this is just nice to hear I guess.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,BTC Dominance,2025-02-05 09:38:32,"BTC & Chainlink are the only cryptos up in my portfolio. BTC average is around 63k. BTC is my second biggest holding after ETH. 

My alt bags are down heavily between 15%-60%. They were up a similar amount in November and I didn't take profits. 

Does it make sense to use extra cash to average up on BTC in 90-94k range or to cut losses on some of the alts until QT ends. Or just wait.

ETH bag is 17% down.. Literally bought some more ETH at the worst time before last weekend... I know. 

I treat BTC as an investment. The BTC I own is basically in an ETF (which I know, a lot of people on this sub will say what's the point if you don't have it on your own wallet?). I get that, I get the risks, but I came into BTC a lot later and I treat it as any other asset class. 

I'm planning to sell the BTC this bull cycle by the end of year. As well as selling all other cryptos too.

The question is: wait and hold the alt bags until QT ends. Who knows when this could happen, and alts could bleed a lot more until then. 

Or just cut some of the smaller losses alts and go all in on BTC. I haven't sold any BTC since I bought in August, so I would be averaging up. 

Anyone else in a similar situation as me? Too premature on the alt season? ",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Inverse Cramer? Last week, Cramer turned bullish on crypto and we saw the largest crypto liquidation within days",2025-02-05 01:21:08,"A week ago, Cramer was telling everyone to hold Bitcoin out of the blue: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ibw8mq/jim\_cramer\_says\_hold\_bitcoin\_not\_microstrategy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ibw8mq/jim_cramer_says_hold_bitcoin_not_microstrategy/)

Within days, BTC got to its lowest price of the year of 91.5k - which was close to a 3 month low since November of last year.

Altcoins got even more badly rekted, with many major alts losing close to 1/3 of their value on the daily chart. Shitcoins got rekted even worse.

This was the largest crypto liquidation ever (2 billion was wiped out), and this isn't the only major event Inverse Cramer has predicted. Let's look at other crazy accurate Inverse Cramer calls for each year which would have helped you to make a killing:

* Flipping totally bullish on BTC in 2021 at the 69k peak - that was also the crypto market peak for the cycle.
* After the FTX crash, screaming that Solana would go to zero when the price was at the bottom below $10 (if you bought then, 20-30x returns in less than 24 months)
* Being bearish on BTC and crypto just right before we had the run up to 100k late last year

When Cramer is bearish, we are rightfully bullish.

And when Cramer is bullish, I see comments always saying ""This time Inverse Cramer will fail"" - but heck the hopium always fails. Cramer shoots, and he will miss the target 100% of the time!

I'm convinced that the only reason that the Inverse Cramer ETF didn't take off is because he himself started buying the ETF in the first place.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,How Movement is revolutionizing DeFi's scalability and security on Ethereum with Move.,2025-02-05 15:54:08,"Movement contributes to the scalability and security of DeFi applications on Ethereum through a number of technical and architectural innovations, primarily by integrating the Move programming language and its virtual machine (MoveVM) with Ethereum's liquidity and ecosystem.

  
Here are Movement's main contributions to the scalability and security of DeFi applications on Ethereum:

**Enhanced Security with Move:**

* Resource-Oriented Programming: The Move language uses a resource-oriented programming model, where digital assets are managed as resources with strict rules about their creation and transfer. This significantly reduces common vulnerabilities in Solidity, such as re-entry, overflows, and underflows.
* Formal Verification: Move includes Move Prover, a formal verification tool that mathematically analyzes code to ensure correctness and detect vulnerabilities before execution. This process provides a higher level of security than Solidity, where vulnerabilities are common and have resulted in billions of dollars in losses.
* Common Attack Prevention: Move is designed to inherently prevent common attacks on Solidity, providing an additional layer of security for DeFi applications.

**Escalabilidad a Través de la Paralelización:**

* Block-STM Engine: The MoveVM implements Block-STM, a parallel execution engine that allows multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously. This results in higher throughput and scalability, reaching up to 180,000 TPS, compared to the limitations of the EVM. The ability to execute transactions in parallel is crucial for DeFi applications that require high throughput and low latency.
* App-Specific Rollups: Movement allows the creation of application-specific rollups, isolating the transactions of one application from others on the network. This avoids congestion and bottlenecks, allowing high-activity DeFi applications (such as gaming and trading) to operate without affecting the performance of other applications on the same network.

**Interoperability and Liquidity:**

* EVM support - Movement offers EVM support through the Fractal interpreter, allowing developers to deploy existing Solidity contracts on MoveVM. This makes it easy to migrate Ethereum DeFi applications to Movement without rewriting code, preserving the original logic and functionality and leveraging Move's security. In addition, Movement connects the MoveVM and Ethereum ecosystems, allowing applications to run on multiple blockchains.
* Liquidity Access: Movement enables DeFi applications to access liquidity in both Ethereum and the Move ecosystem. By connecting to these two worlds, DeFi apps can take advantage of existing liquidity in Ethereum, while benefiting from the security and performance of Move.
* Secure Bridges: Movement uses an Ethereum JSON RPC endpoint to process EVM requests and convert them into MoveVM-compliant calls, eliminating the need for third-party bridges and their associated vulnerabilities.

**Modular and Customizable Infrastructure:**

* Move Stack: Movement uses a modular architecture called Move Stack that allows developers to choose the most appropriate components for their applications, such as sequencers, data availability and settlement mechanisms. This modularity allows developers to optimize the performance, cost and security of their DeFi applications.
* Decentralized Shared Sequencer (DSS): Movement uses a shared decentralized sequencer that improves censorship resistance and reliability. The DSS facilitates atomic transactions between chains and shared liquidity between rollups, improving the efficiency and security of the ecosystem.

**Examples of DeFi applications in Movement:**

* VCRED: An AI-enhanced liquidity management platform, uses Movement to increase capital efficiency by up to 160x. VCRED leverages the security of Move and the scalability of Movement to optimize staking strategies and deliver better returns.
* Meridian and Echelon: Lending protocols that have raised capital and are building in the Movement ecosystem.
* Raga Finance: A platform for managing assets in a multi-chain world, offering native yields and secure transactions.

Movement not only provides a more secure environment for DeFi applications through the Move language, but also improves scalability through parallelization and modular architecture. The combination of security, performance and EVM compatibility make Movement a promising solution to drive growth and innovation in the DeFi space on Ethereum.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

  
Thanks! (:",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119
Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

    # NOTE: No concerns are made for timing safety
    # These two functions are just plain CTR mode with key commitment enhancement

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-02-07 12:18:15.944119
