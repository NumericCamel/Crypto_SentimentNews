This again provides some optimism concerning ETH, which has continued to underperform in this market cycle.  Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With This Bullish Pattern In a TradingView post, BasicTrading revealed that a breakout to $4,000 looks to be on the horizon for the Ethereum price following the formation of a rising channel pattern. This bullish prediction came as the analyst noted that ETH had been retesting the previous all-time high resistance and was not able to break it.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 However, this time, it could be different following the rising channel pattern. The analyst added that with the bullish break and retest and Ethereum price action, the breakout is about to happen. With Ethereum likely to break this psychological $4,000 resistance level soon enough, the analyst suggested that this could ultimately pave the way for ETH to reach and possibly surpass its current ATH of $4,800. BasicTrading remarked that the sky is the limit for the Ethereum price if it manages to break above its current ATH. Interestingly, the crypto analyst raised the possibility of ETH rising to between $20,000 and $25,000 if it replicates its historical performance from previous bull cycles. This price range represents the upper resistance trendline of the rising channel.  However, the analyst stated that the Ethereum price must first achieve a clear breakout of its current ATH before a rally to as high as $25,000 can become a possibility. This bullish projection for ETH comes just days after crypto analyst Ali Martinez explained why it wasn’t time to give up on Ethereum despite its underperformance in this market cycle. Martinez mentioned that a decisive breakout above $4,000 could send ETH to $7,000.  ETH To Reach Five Digits In This Bull Run Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has also backed BasicTrading’s bullish outlook as he predicted that the Ethereum price would at least reach $10,000 in this market cycle. The analyst asserted that ETH will come back with a “vengeance” in the coming months. He added that $10,000 is the bare minimum once Ethereum breaks out. CrediBULL Crypto further opined that $20,000 is certainly not unreasonable by the end of this cycle.  Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, stating that ETH’s hated rally that will bring it to $12,000 is loading. He further remarked that the chart is giving market participants a glimpse and that patience is all it takes.  At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,400, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Significantly, CoinShares submitted applications for a spot XRP ETF and a Litecoin (LTC) fund, indicating an increasing enthusiasm for altcoin investment offerings. CoinShares Targets Litecoin And XRP ETF CoinShares’ submission arises as the US ETF market is progressively concentrating on cryptocurrency investments, after the approval and resulting success of funds investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2024. The firm has submitted an S-1 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the XRP ETF, aimed at providing investors with direct exposure to the market’s second largest altcoin.  Related Reading: SAB 122 Is A Bigger Bitcoin Price Catalyst Than The US BTC Reserve Additionally, CoinShares is expanding its offerings by applying for a spot Litecoin ETF, positioning itself as one of the few companies actively exploring altcoin-based ETFs in the US market. On the same day, Grayscale Investments also filed applications with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for both a Solana ETF and a Litecoin ETF, alingning with other firms, including Canary Capital and CoinShares, all seeking regulatory approval for similar products. Skepticism Surrounds Proposed Litecoin ETF Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the XRP ETF filing, the altcoin has shown a mixed response in the market. XRP recently emerged from a nearly three-year consolidation period below the $0.50 mark, boosted by excitement surrounding pro-crypto regulatory shifts under President Donald Trump.  Currently, XRP is experiencing remarkable momentum, boasting a staggering 500% year-to-date gain, trading at approximately $3.10. However, the announcement of CoinShares’ XRP ETF did not significantly impact the token’s price, which remains down 0.4% within a 24-hour period.  Related Reading: XRP Long Term Potential Remains Extremely Bullish Possibility Of Price At $20 On a more critical note, the proposed Litecoin ETF has sparked skepticism among some market experts. Analyst Ali Martinez expressed concerns regarding the viability of a Litecoin ETF, pointing out that the coin has remained stuck in the same price range since 2017, a span of eight years.  The analyst continued to probe the reasoning for initiating a Litecoin ETF when ironic options, like a “USDT ETF,” he claims, might provide more instant advantages such as staking rewards.

Despite the market’s inherent volatility, price action remains robust, fueling optimism among investors and analysts. As the broader crypto market enters a bullish phase, XRP is gaining attention as a potential leader in the next major rally. Related Reading: Solana Compresses Near Previous ATH – Gearing Up For The Next Leg Higher? Market sentiment is growing increasingly positive, with analysts predicting a massive move into price discovery. Among them, crypto expert Carl Runefelt has shared an intriguing technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish setup for XRP. According to Runefelt, the price is forming a bullish pennant pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, a classic indicator of potential upward continuation. This pattern suggests that XRP is consolidating before a significant breakout, which could propel the price into uncharted territory. As excitement builds, investors are watching closely to see whether XRP can sustain its momentum and capitalize on the bullish market environment. A breakout from the bullish pennant could confirm XRP’s trajectory toward new milestones, reinforcing its position as one of the market’s most dynamic assets.  XRP About To Enter Price Discovery XRP is on the verge of entering price discovery as the broader crypto market signals a bullish rally. Following a strong pump in early November, XRP’s price action has remained resilient, fueling optimism for substantial gains in the months ahead. As the market flirts with a decisive phase, XRP continues to stand out as a top contender for life-changing returns for investors and traders. Renowned crypto analyst Carl Runefelt has shared an insightful technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish setup for XRP. According to Runefelt, the price is forming a bullish pennant pattern on the 4-hour timeframe, a classic indicator of potential upward continuation. Based on this setup, Runefelt has set a price target of $4.20 in the coming weeks, aligning with broader expectations of a market-wide rally. The bullish pennant suggests that XRP is consolidating before its next major move. If the pattern holds, the breakout could propel XRP into uncharted territory, confirming its position as a leading asset in this market cycle. Related Reading: Chainlink Is In The Middle Of A Bullish Breakout – Analyst Sets $50 Target As the market gears up for a potentially explosive phase, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on the momentum. With its strong price action and favorable technical setup, XRP has the potential to deliver significant returns. Investors and traders are closely watching as XRP prepares for its next move, with anticipation building for what could be a pivotal rally. Price Testing Critical Levels XRP is currently trading at $3.19, following a massive surge above its previous all-time high last week. The recent price action highlights XRP’s strength as it continues to attract investor interest during this bullish phase. However, the asset has entered a brief consolidation phase, which could signal preparation for its next move. For bulls to maintain momentum and sustain the uptrend, reclaiming the $3.25 resistance level is critical. Breaking above this mark would likely reignite buying pressure and pave the way for another push toward new all-time highs. Achieving this would reinforce the bullish structure and solidify XRP’s position as one of the market’s top-performing assets. Conversely, holding above the $3.05 support level is equally important to confirm the ongoing trend. This level has become a key line of defense, and a breakdown below it could signal weakness, potentially leading to a deeper correction and testing lower demand zones.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Consolidates But Open Interest Points to Potential Breakout,2025-01-24 21:00:30+00:00,"Ethereum is now demonstrating steady price growth, posting a 6% rise in the past day as the broader cryptocurrency market rallied. This upward momentum follows news of a US executive order establishing a national digital asset stockpile, contributing to a positive market environment. Amid this backdrop, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC has provided a fresh perspective on Ethereum’s current trajectory. Shayan highlights an interesting divergence between the increasing open interest in Ethereum futures and the price, which has yet to reach previous highs. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Price Stalls Below $3,500 as Leverage Ratios Climb—What Next? Growing Futures Market and Divergent Price Action According to Shayan in a post recently uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Ethereum’s open interest—an indicator of active futures contracts—has surged to its highest levels in recent weeks, indicating heightened market participation and growing interest among traders. The analyst notes that the rise in ETH’s open interest and slow price response suggests a disconnect between market sentiment and price performance. While futures traders appear optimistic, this optimism has not yet translated into Ethereum breaking key resistance levels. The analyst wrote: Interestingly, there is a divergence between Ethereum’s price and futures market activity. Despite the significant increase in open interest, the price has yet to break its previous highs, showcasing a potential imbalance between market expectations and price action. Shayan also notes that elevated open interest could lead to volatility. Historically, large buildups in open interest have been followed by significant price swings as positions are liquidated. Although the direction of the next move remains uncertain, current activity and sentiment lean toward a potential bullish breakout. Shayan suggested that if Ethereum can surpass critical resistance, it could pave the way for a more prolonged rally. Market Concerns And Bearish Indicators In contrast, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, presents a more cautious outlook. Darkfost points to a range of bearish factors, including increasing Ethereum inflows and reserves on Binance. According to the data shared by Darkfost, since September 2024, Ethereum inflows have consistently outpaced outflows, leading to a rise in exchange reserves. This trend reflects selling pressure, as more Ethereum is moved to exchanges, potentially indicating an intent to sell rather than hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Revival: What the Signs Say About Its Next Move Additionally, Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio has remained bearish for months, showing a consistent dominance of sell orders. Darkfost reveals that the shift in these metrics suggests that some investors may be locking in profits or reallocating capital elsewhere, leading to a more cautious market sentiment.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,SAB 122 Is A Bigger Bitcoin Price Catalyst Than The US BTC Reserve,2025-01-24 18:00:50+00:00,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Thursday, January 23, the rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121, a directive that had imposed stringent accounting requirements on crypto custody for US banks and financial institutions. The move, encapsulated in the newly issued SAB 122, is poised to serve as a more substantial catalyst for Bitcoin’s price dynamics than the anticipated US Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), according to several industry experts. Implications For Bitcoin Originally enacted in 2022, SAB 121 mandated that banks classify customer-held cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. This classification significantly increased the operational costs and complexities for financial institutions, effectively deterring them from offering crypto-related services. Thus, the requirement acted as a barrier, limiting the integration of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into mainstream banking operations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capital Inflows See Notable Slowdown, But Is This A Worry? The withdrawal of SAB 121 through SAB 122 effectively removes this accounting impediment. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce lauded the decision on social media, stating, “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun: http://SEC.gov | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122.” The Bitcoin community has responded favorably to the SEC’s decision. Andrew Parish, founder of x3, emphasized the significance of SAB 122 on X, asserting, “Rescinding of SAB 121 is a bigger catalyst for Bitcoin than the SBR. Bookmark this post.” Similarly, Fred Krueger, founder of Troop, highlighted the broader market implications, noting, “SAB 122 is extremely good for Bitcoin. More significant than the Bitcoin Reserve, which is also coming. Now watch the Banks start accumulating.” Vijay Boyapati, an Ex-Google engineer and the author of The Bullish Case for Bitcoin, further elaborated on the transformative potential of the SEC’s action, stating, “It really is hard to emphasize how huge a sea change we’re witnessing. We went from the worst conceivable anti-Bitcoin, anti-innovation, anti-growth, anti-business administration to the most friendly Bitcoin administration you could hope for. This is 100% not priced in.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, succinctly captured the market sentiment with his tweet: “SAB 121 has been rescinded, allowing banks to custody Bitcoin. 🚀” This aligns with Saylor’s previously outlined tgree catalysts for Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin, where the facilitation of traditional bank custody stood as last open m factor. The regulatory easing is expected to catalyze increased institutional participation in the BTC and crypto market. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America—the second-largest US bank by assets—addressed the potential for broader crypto adoption during an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Moynihan stated, “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” This statement aligns with the SEC’s latest directive, indicating that banks are now more likely to develop and offer crypto services, including custody solutions, which were previously constrained under SAB 121. The removal of these regulatory hurdles is anticipated to enhance the liquidity and accessibility of Bitcoin, potentially driving a new wave of demand similar to the spot ETFs in January last year.

While the asset has experienced a series of bullish events that have driven its price to its current level, the analyst strongly believes that the cryptocurrency can jump even higher to reach $20.  XRP Long To Short Term Price Prediction According to a crypto analyst identified as ‘XRP Meesku’ on X (formerly Twitter), the XRP price is gearing up to skyrocket to a new long-term ATH target of $20. The analyst’s bullish outlook for the token stems from its innovative potential, as advanced developments and technological advancements tend to drive price surges in a cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue Notably, the analyst revealed that there has been ongoing speculation that XRP could be pivotal in national banking. He highlighted that many discussions have arisen suggesting that the altcoin could be used as a potential base layer for the United States (US) banking system. If this happens, it could fuel significant growth and adoption for XRP, potentially positioning it as a “global asset that is gaining traction.” Moreover, it could trigger a price increase of $20 ATH for the altcoin.  In the mid-term time frame, XRP Meeksu predicts that the altcoin could potentially hit $8 first before attempting to break past its cycle top. He reveals that his optimistic outlook for XRP was influenced by factors such as new financial products like futures and the ongoing legal challenges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Based on his analysis, the crypto expert suggests that resolving these issues could spark a price rally.   Finally, the analyst shared a short-term price forecast for XRP, highlighting that altcoin is expected to experience significant volatility, leading to price fluctuations. Due to its sharp growth potential, he predicts a surge to $3.6 or higher was possible. Moreover, the X market expert mentioned the increase in significant liquidation trends, underscoring that traders may take a long position after being forced to close due to market fluctuations. Bullish Factors Driving The Price Surge While the XRP Meeksu shares his long- to short-term bullish prediction for the XRP price, the analyst also outlines several bullish activities that could drive a potential surge in the cryptocurrency. According to the crypto expert, the XRP market has seen a lot of activity lately, with the price stabilizing despite spikes in whale activity.  Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Looking at the asset’s past performances, the analyst mentions a notable transfer of $62 million to various crypto exchanges — a movement that could potentially be seen as a sell signal for strategic whale repositioning.

Despite the lawsuit drama, the crypto expert disclosed that XRP’s overall sentiment remains bullish as analysts project more growth in the future.  He revealed that XRP is showing signs of a price recovery and could soon hit new ATHs. Moreover, its community remains vibrant and active, sharing updates about ongoing scam threats, key events, and more.

Well, $WEPE plans to make such insider information available to retail traders now. Because of its unique mission of leveling the playing field, $WEPE’s price prediction looks good. The presale has raised a staggering $58M so far, but it ends in less than 23 days, meaning the current price of $0.0003665 is the lowest you’ll get $WEPE for. Check out our guide on how to buy WEPE for more information. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Layer 2 Solution for Solana Solaxy ($SOLX) has been specifically designed to address Solana’s limitations and unlock its full potential. As good as Solana is, it suffers from regular network congestion, scalability issues, and transactions not being executed reliably. Solaxy aims to not only increase the smoothness with which transactions are carried out on Solana but also do so in a more cost-effective manner than ever before. With over $14M in presale funding so far, Solaxy is set to be the next presale to explode, seeing as the Solana bulls are winning. 1 $SOLX is currently available for $0.001612, but hurry up because prices increase in under 19 hours when the presale enters its next stage. Interested? Here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX. 3. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – Self-Evolving AI Agent Offers Actionable Crypto Insights MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is powered by AI, which automatically makes it one of the most fascinating crypto projects on the market right now. It aims to cut through all the clutter presently overloading the crypto ecosystem and offer token holders exclusive access to upcoming trends and massive staking rewards. $MIND’s advanced AI agent works by engaging in lengthy discussions with online communities and influencers, analyzing the current market sentiments, and then forming its own opinions to provide actionable insights. You can benefit from MIND of Pepe’s cutting-edge hive-mind analysis by joining its presale, which has raised over $3.5M so far and is offering each token for $0.0031889. Here’s how to buy $MIND. 4. YourTrump ($YTP) – Benefit From Donald Trump’s Fanbase We’ve all seen how $TRUMP was received by the crypto market, as it skyrocketed by more than 12,000% almost immediately after its launch. If you missed $TRUMP’s rally, consider investing in YourTrump ($YTP). It, too, is based on Donald Trump’s popularity. $YTP mentions its expected listing price on its website, and it’s currently $5.7666. Given that you can buy 1 $YTP for just $0.0284, that’s a nearly 20,300% return. However, interested investors should hurry up, as the presale ends in about a week from now. Cryptos to the Moon, but Make Sure You’re a Good Pilot Although our calculations and analysis suggest that the 4 crypto presales mentioned above are among the very best investment opportunities the crypto space has to offer right now, we urge you not to take it as financial advice. You must always do your own research (DYOR) before investing your hard-earned money in any asset, let alone crypto, which is pretty volatile in nature.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin to $150K in 2025, Analyst Says. Will Wall Street Pepe Ride the 100x Wave?",2025-01-24 15:07:33+00:00,"James Check, a Glassdote analyst, has predicted that Bitcoin ($BTC) could cross the $150K mark in 2025. This prediction is inspired by the token’s 2016-2017 cycle when Bitcoin moved from the range of $800-1600 to $19,783. If BTC follows the same pattern, it can consolidate up until May, after which a significant bull run can be seen. However, Check believes that BTC won’t be able to hold the highs of $150K. The range of $120,000 to $150,000 would be the ‘topping cloud’ for BTC, after which it can see a significant correction, as the crypto markets are expected to turn bearish at the start of 2026. Bitquant, a crypto trader, said on X that people who think that Bitcoin has topped out at current levels will miss out on significant gains. He predicts a macrocycle bull run during the fourth quarter of 2025. If the 2016 cycle is indeed being played out, Bitcoin can make a new high in around 230-330 days from now, crossing the recent high of $109,000 it made after Trump won the elections. If you missed Bitcoin’s latest rally and are looking for a good investment opportunity, we suggest meme coins such as Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE). Ever since Trump launched his own meme coin, Official Trump ($TRUMP), the industry has been on fire – and $WEPE could be the next 100x meme coin. What is Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE)? Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is inspired by the OG Pepe meme and looks to end the dominance of crypto whales in the industry. The project focuses on building an information-driven community where all token holders will get access to exclusive insider trading knowledge, alpha calls, and strategies. This is the kind of information that was previously only available to institutional investors or whales. $WEPE’s community infamously referred to as the frog army, looks to grow together and build the next generation of wealthy traders as they flip the script on these whales. Given that $WEPE aims to bring about a community-driven change, over 38K followers on X and 17K subscribers on its Telegram channel are seriously impressive numbers. Its approach and revolutionary mission have helped Wall Street Pepe raise $58M in its ongoing presale, which will only last for the next 23 days or until the tokens are sold out. However, if $WEPE’s popularity amidst meme crypto enthusiasts is anything to go by, its presale will most likely be sold out before the clock runs out. So, this may be your only chance to buy $WEPE. It’s available for just $0.0003665 per token, and you can check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE to make a seamless purchase. Why Can $Wepe Be the Next 100x Meme Coin? The idea of empowering small investors has drawn in new and inexperienced crypto investors towards $WEPE.  The days when a small group of whales could control the market with insider news are seemingly gone. $WEPE aims to now put this power in the hands of small traders like you and me. $WEPE’s potential could be huge, which is why even crypto whales have been investing in the token. For instance, on 16th December, a whale bought $200K worth of $WEPE in a single transaction. Also, $WEPE is a true successor of PEPE, which has already minted massive returns for some investors. With a current market cap of $6.59B, this frog meme coin is said to have earned 1,200% gains for early adopters. $WEPE is now trying to do exactly the same. If you want to get on the frog frenzy, head on to the official $WEPE presale website and buy the token now. However, bear in mind that crypto investments are subject to both internal and external market conditions, which make them pretty volatile. This is why you must always do your own research before pouring any money into meme coins. Also, while we aim to arm new traders with the latest and greatest crypto insights, none of what we put out is a substitute for financial advice.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Enthusiasm Peaks At $100K, Yet Expert Eyes A $95K Dip",2025-01-24 15:00:18+00:00,"The consistent retail demand for Bitcoin at the $100,000 mark, which indicates high investor confidence, has recently drawn notice. However, because short-term holders are driving the present accumulating trend, market watchers are warning of a possible fall to $95,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Cap Hits $832 Billion Milestone As $100K Inflows Begin To Slow Retail Investors Accumulate At Record Pace Retail investors, which include smaller holders termed as “Shrimps” and “Crabs,” have been enthusiastically accumulating Bitcoin. In the last month, Glassnode reports that these groups collectively added 25,600 BTC to their portfolios. That’s nearly twice the amount of newly mined Bitcoin over the same period, a sign of significant demand for the “digital gold” at its price peaks. Demand from retail investors for #Bitcoin at prices around $100K remains strong – The Shrimp-Crab cohort (up to 1 and 10 #BTC, respectively) absorbed 1.9x the newly mined Bitcoin supply last month, a total of +25.6k $BTC: https://t.co/l0sjVN2Toi pic.twitter.com/UdzcCWXAGo — glassnode (@glassnode) January 23, 2025 The purchasing activity of these smaller investors highlights an even more general retail enthusiasm trend. Nonetheless, experts must still exercise caution. Although this degree of accumulation is remarkable, the dominance of short-term holders (STHs) in this surge introduces an element of risk for market stability. Short-Term Holders Pose A Risk Often selling off during slight declines to guarantee gains, STHs are renowned for their fast responses to market changes. Particularly in cases of unexpected volatility for Bitcoin, this reflexive behavior could set off higher selling pressure. Teddy, a market analyst, underlined that the existence of STHs might have a major impact on temporary price swings. While STHs (Short-Term Holders) have indeed absorbed a significant portion of the newly mined Bitcoin supply, it’s crucial to consider the behavioral tendencies of this group. STHs are historically more susceptible to panic during minor market fluctuations, often resulting in… pic.twitter.com/dasfRgjOFR — Teddy (@TeddyVision) January 23, 2025 Historically, the markets are also more sensitive to the downtrends with STH. Analysts feel that along with this prevailing trend, at such levels, caution for investors would be prudent. Glassnode: Narrow Bitcoin Range Another anomaly which Glassnode picked out in the price action of Bitcoin is an unusually tight range over the past 60 days. Such events have been precedents for volatile times ahead. This coincides with historical trends, which suggest that the market will experience either a breakout or a breakdown soon. While the sustained $100,000 price level reflects optimism, the market’s narrow range adds an air of unpredictability. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Tops XRP In Trading Volume Despite Sharp Decline A Possible Pullback Soon? Given all of these factors, some experts believe Bitcoin may be due for a slight price adjustment in the near future. Some experts, like market veteran Michaël van de Poppe, predict a retreat to $95,000, primarily due to STHs selling in the face of market uncertainty. For the time being, retail demand remains a solid source of support at $100,000. Investors should, however, brace themselves for volatility and keep an eye out for market indicators. As Bitcoin trades near its peak, the interaction of retail euphoria and market risks will determine its next moves. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $105,141, up 3.2% and 3.2% in the daily and weekly timeframes. Featured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,solana,Wallet got drained through Telegram scam,2025-01-24 19:40:58,"DONT FALL FOR THE SCAM. If you check my post history I posted asking for help understanding what happened with my trades. Now I’m posting again to warn everyone of a scam. I’m going to try to explain to the best of my ability.

 For reference I’m usually good at scanning for scams. Although at this moment my emotions got the best of me and blinded my intuition. A redditor replied to me telling me to join a subreddit r / Whales On Sol that claimed to have explained my problem, I went to join the TG “for more information” and a was required to sign into my TG for the safeguard bot. They then proceeded to log into my account (which I wasn’t notified of) got my complaint to Bullx ticket number and contacted me again through another account claiming to be a “help representative”.

This is again, where I didn’t listen to my intuition (as I found it very suspicious that he needed my 2fa code to prove that I was the owner of the account) but I gave it to anyways because he had my ticket number and i wasn’t notified of the sign in on TG. There was no other way for them to know the ticket number. A couple of seconds after sending it, I realized what had happened and instantly went to my account to send the Sol to a different wallet, but the damage was already done. He had completely drained my account. 

I fully understand that is my fault. Sorry for the rambling, I’m emotional right now, it wasn’t my life savings so I’ll be ok. I’m not asking for pity or help. This is a learning moment for me and I hope this post can help those who are also new to the crypto space to be wary of scammers. I’m absolutely done with trading meme coins and shit coins. I wish you guys all the best, I’m just not cut out for this.

Reddit,solana,STRENGTHENING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY,2025-01-25 00:08:34,"We’re not even a full week into the new administration, and we’re already getting great news for the future of the Crypto industry. On Thursday night, President Trump signed an executive order to promote the growth of crypto in the U.S. and work towards developing a national digital asset stockpile. 

Here’s what you need to know:
The order emphasizes the importance of supporting the growth of legitimate, dollar-backed stablecoins globally to strengthen the U.S. dollar. 
It also creates a new working group to consider the requirements and implications of a national digital asset stockpile, “potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.”
It outlines key protections for individuals and companies that use blockchain networks, as well as the developers and miners securing these networks.
It prohibits creating a “central bank digital currency,” a type of cryptocurrency overseen by the government that many crypto enthusiasts believe contradicts industry ideology. 
The order promises “fair and open access to banking services” for crypto companies, a response to complaints from these companies that banks are denying them accounts. (Shortly after the order was issued, the SEC rolled back accounting guidance that previously deterred banks from working with crypto companies). 

You can read more about the order:

Question is, in the US, does that count as a sale? With “regular” staking, I’m not exchanging any tokens. But if I swap to JitoSOL, then there is an exchange.

I’d like to do it, but don’t want to incur an extra capital gains tax on top of what I am incurring due to regular staking, as I plan to hold the SOL for a while.

Reddit,solana,How to Keep Your Funds Safu on Solana,2025-01-24 12:36:44,"Solana is great, but like any crypto space, scammers are everywhere. I noticed there has been a great influx of new members to the community. So if your new (or even if you are not), here is what you should do to protect yourself.

# 1. Use a Hardware Wallet

If you have a lot of SOL or valuable NFTs, dont just leave them sitting in a hot wallet. Get a Ledger or Trezor and store them offline. This will improve your sleep.

Also, do NOT connect your hardware wallet to random dApps unless you are very sure it is safe.

# 2. Be Careful with Approvals

Every time you connect your wallet to a new site, you are giving them permissions. Before approving anything, read what it is asking for.

* If it asks for **""unlimited spending""**, think twice.
* If its a brand-new project, use a **separate burner wallet** instead.

# 3. Watch Out for Scams

Some of the most common scams:

* **Fake airdrops** – If something suddenly appears in your wallet and asks you to ""claim"" it, ignore it.
* **Fake mint sites** – Always get mint links from official Twitter/Discord accounts.
* **Impersonators**  \- “Hello sir, I’m support.” **No, you are a scammer.**

# 4. Remove Unused Permissions

Go to [solscan.io](http://solscan.io) and check which dApps have access to your wallet. If you do not use something anymore, remove its permissions. Phantom also has a setting for this.

# 5. Use a Burner Wallet for Risky Stuff

If you are minting NFTs or testing new DeFi platforms, use a **separate wallet** with a small balance. If something goes wrong, your main funds stay safe.

If you have been in Solana for a while, what is the best security tip you learned? Or what is the worst scam you seen?",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

 I want to focus first on memecoins with short lifetimes and rugpulls

I am locking for something that will show me a step by step list of the involved actions and the accounts who did the actions, like

* the creation of a token 
* minting
* creation of a liquidity pool
* who supplied the liquidity
* then the transaction/transfers
* when the liquidity was removed and who it was transferred to

For each step, when possible, I also want to see how the value of the token has changed. 

I realize that you can scan very deep into the transactions. I would like to see a level that would help me understand the lifecycle process with actual data. I realize that where the money came from and where it was sent can likely be a complex network. That is not what I want to see (yet).

Joined neo.bullx a little over 3 weeks ago. Setup my wallet with my private key. Saved that private key to a seperare hard drive in a notepad file.

Only used that key 1 singular time. (Directly through the official Nova bot telegram channel.) To connect my wallet on neo.bullx to Nova.

That is the only time ive used that private key.

Went to login to my wallet yesterday and noticed my entire account was drained. Someone transferred all my 3.5 sol to another wallet. 

Added 2fa on my account, logged out of my account across all devices. Neo.bullx is weird since it logs you in through telegram. And you can only have 1 telegram account for 1 phone number. So it appears I'm stuck with one account for Neo.bullx.

Steps i've taken
- Archived old wallets on Neo.bullx (can't delete primary one for some reason.)
- Added 2fa on bullx & logged out of all devices several times
- Created a brand new email/phantom wallet (used a really strong generated password, each unique.) 
- Added way more 2fa/security updates to telegram/phantom/email account.

Completely factory reset my pc (deleted everything including personal files. If there was somehow a keylogger.

I've changed the old email password/authentication methods as well. 

So considering ive updated Neobullx 2fa and created a brand new phantom wallet under a brand new email (both with unique passwords and heavy authentications.) Do you think its safe to link this new phantom wallet to that neobullx account that had the funds stolen?

What are good options? Should I just switch platforms entirely?

I'm also very careful with clicking external links for scams/phishing

Any help appreciated.  Thanks

# 🎊 Market-Driven Emissions Proposal

Solana's current inflation mechanism uses a fixed emissions schedule to reward validators and stakers who maintain the network's security. 

This schedule began with an 8% annual inflation rate at the network's launch, designed to incentivize early participation. This rate decreases by 15% each year and is expected to stabilize at 1.5% around 2030.

Validators play a key role, receiving newly issued SOL for validating transactions and sharing these rewards with stakers who delegate their tokens. 

These rewards are composed not only of emissions but also of transaction fees and Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which validators earn by strategically ordering transactions.

The fixed emissions schedule, while providing predictability, has limitations. It doesn't adapt to changing network conditions, meaning token issuance remains constant regardless of the economic climate or staking levels. 

This rigidity was less of a concern when Solana was nascent and needed to attract validators. However, as the network matured, validators became less reliant on token emissions for income, supplementing it with MEV and transaction fees.

The current model continues to benefit stakers through emissions but dilutes the value of SOL held by non-stakers. This has raised concerns about inflation's impact on SOL's overall utility and attractiveness.

The proposed governance change, [SIMD-0228](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/5c9c06daddfb35b6dd9a9317bfa58ac2e52aee0f/proposals/0228-market-based-emission-mechanism.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org), introduces Smart Emissions, aiming to make inflation rates more responsive to real-time network conditions. 

The proposal sets a target staking participation rate of 50%, calculated as the total staked SOL divided by the circulating supply.

* If staking participation falls below 50%, the network would increase token emissions to incentivize more staking and bolster security.
* Conversely, if staking participation exceeds 50%, emissions would decrease to mitigate inflationary pressure and reduce staking rewards.

This adjustment would be programmatic, automatically responding to changes in staking levels.

The proposal includes upper and lower bounds for emissions. 

The upper bound would align with Solana's current inflation schedule, preventing excessive emissions. The lower bound would allow emissions to temporarily drop to zero if staking participation consistently surpasses the target. 

This flexibility allows the network to adapt without over-issuing tokens.

If implemented, this proposal could significantly alter Solana's economic dynamics. Validators and stakers might experience reduced rewards, especially if MEV revenue doesn't fully compensate for lower emissions. 

However, overall inflation would likely decrease, and SOL could even become deflationary over time, mitigating dilution for non-stakers and potentially improving $SOL's utility in DeFi.

This shift would mark a significant evolution in Solana's monetary policy, transitioning from fixed schedules to a more flexible and responsive model.

# 🤖 Solana Virtual Machine

This deep-dive into Solana's SVM compares its multi-threaded, parallel processing capabilities to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), highlighting their fundamental differences and implications for developers.

It also talks about the key role of Sealevel, the technology that enables Solana to process transactions concurrently, and explains how localized fee markets further distinguish Solana from Ethereum’s global fee model.

For Solana developers, understanding the SVM is key to appreciating how its architecture supports dApps with unmatched efficiency.

By utilizing the full capacity of validator hardware, the SVM offers a game-changing alternative to the single-threaded EVM, which struggles with bottlenecks during peak demand.

This article will help deepen your understanding of what sets Solana apart from other blockchains and how the SVM opens new possibilities for dApp development.

# 💰 Multicoin's Solana Thesis

Multicoin Capital’s latest thesis, authored by Kyle Samani, examines how Solana can play a central role in building what they describe as Internet Capital Markets. 

The report focuses on how Solana’s technology and ecosystem have matured to address challenges in finance, with an emphasis on efficiency, accessibility, and scalability.

Since its early days in 2018, Solana has grown significantly, now valued at $100 billion. 

It has one of the fastest-growing developer ecosystems and has surpassed Ethereum in several key metrics, including trading volumes and daily active addresses. 

Multicoin views Solana as a platform capable of outperforming TradFi systems, not just on cost and speed, but also by retaining blockchain-native features like permissionless access and composability.

A central argument is that Solana has the potential to reduce financial services fees by up to 99% while still increasing its market cap to exceed major financial incumbents.

The thesis explains that while payments are not a primary revenue driver for blockchains, they are essential for adoption.

Solana’s transaction fees are extremely low, making it far cheaper than traditional payment systems. This affordability, coupled with its ease of use, encourages the growth of wallet adoption and ecosystem engagement.

Some of the key factors that Kyle highlights in this report are: 

* Introduction of Conditional Liquidity to tighten spreads and reduce risks for market makers
* Implementation of Multiple Concurrent Leaders to decentralize price discovery and reduce latency
* Capable of handling traditional assets, crypto-native assets, and new financial instruments
* Revenue and Value Growth Through MEV
* Expanding Total Addressable Market 
* Expected to play a larger role in global finance as blockchain adoption grows

The report describes Solana’s broader goal as creating a permissionless financial system that integrates low fees, global accessibility, real-time auditability, and composability. 

While Solana serves as the infrastructure, its ecosystem is designed to support  both traditional and crypto-native assets while enabling new market opportunities.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum: More Than Just Crypto - A Platform for Innovation [Commentary],2025-01-24 19:27:24,"Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a revolutionary platform that's transforming the way we interact with technology.  
 * Beyond Transactions: Ethereum goes beyond simple currency transfers. It enables the creation of smart contracts – self-executing agreements with built-in rules – unlocking a world of possibilities.    
 * Decentralized Applications (dApps): From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming and beyond, Ethereum empowers developers to build innovative dApps that are secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship.  
 * A Thriving Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts a vibrant and active community of developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.  
I believe Ethereum has the potential to shape the future of the world. So forget about price talk, that isn't the reason why any of us go into Ethereum after all.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

What are the main advantages of ethereum over Solana and how much of an advantage is it for small-mid size projects?

I know for instance Ethereum is safer and less centralised than Solana, but how much of a problem is this if both aren't really being hacked regularly. (Even Trump coin with like a 30Bn market cap didn't tempt bad actors to attack the chain).

(iii)  protecting and promoting fair and open access to banking services for all law-abiding individual citizens and private-sector entities alike;

(iv)   providing regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent decision making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries, all of which are essential to supporting a vibrant and inclusive digital economy and innovation in digital assets, permissionless blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies; and

(v)    taking measures to protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States, including by prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States.

Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Blockchain Co-Founder for Nonprofit AI Language Startup (2000+ African Languages),2025-01-23 10:02:59,"**The Problem:**  
OpenAI, Meta, and Orange recently announced efforts to build AI for African languages. But here’s the catch: Africa has 2,000+ languages, many with little to no digital data. Without datasets, even the best AI models can’t bridge this gap.

**What We’re Doing:**  
We’re a nonprofit team building a blockchain and tokenomics-powered solution to crowdsource, validate, and incentivize the creation of African language datasets. Think decentralized data ownership, community-driven contributions, and equitable AI access.

**Who We Are:**

\- A team of **4 founders with 27+ combined years** in product development, startups, and AI/data systems.

\- Backgrounds: **AI engineer, Data Engineer, Statistician, Product Engineer, Non-profit and Funding**

\- Committed to impact over profit (**nonprofit structure**).

**We Need You:**

\- Blockchain/tokenomics expertise (Solana, Polygon, smart contracts, token design).

\- Technical enough to lead protocol development.

\- Aligned with the mission: Solve the data desert for African languages.

\- Comfortable with early-stage uncertainty (we’re pre-funding).

**No Fluff:**

\- This isn’t a “get rich quick” project, it is for the long haul. If you want hype, look elsewhere.

\- We’re not here to compete with OpenAI or any other AI war-lord—we’re solving the foundational problem they can’t ignore.

\- Remote work, no location preference.

**If This Resonates:**  
DM me with:

\- Your experience with blockchain projects

\- Why you would like to join us.

\- A brief intro about yourself

Let’s build something real.

P.S. Already working on African language datasets, blockchain for social impact, or decentralized AI? Let’s collaborate, not compete.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,ethereum,Not understanding how ETH was stolen from Phantom Wallet,2025-01-21 03:05:50,"Before I get called an idiot, hear me out.

$1800 in ETH straight up vanished 3 hours after I had received it and was sent to an unknown wallet. The $1800 in ETH came from a friend's coinbase and was sent directly to me. I've never bought anything on the Phantom wallet, I've only ever sent and received. I'm trying my hardest to figure out how the hell it's happened. Somehow the wallet is compromised, but I'm struggling to figure out how it's happened. The password is strong/generated by a password manager, I've not shared the private key or seed phrases (the wallet is a week old).

Nothing else was accessed, eg bank, email, any other accounts, just the Phantom wallet (which I have on a chrome extension and on my mobile, which I had downloaded last night).

The wallet that it went to has only seen IN transactions then whatever is the latest (explanations please)

https://etherscan.io/address/0xd924cC0A843a023ba07a436d779Ec1480Dc4c359

Anyone able to advise on where I went wrong?

Never been interested in nfts, airdrops (don't have a clue what they are), not been clicking or trying receive any free shit.

I've been trying to go over absolutely everything I did yesterday and the only thing I can think I went wrong was when I was researching the melania meme coin, I don't know if I had synced or logged in with the Phantom Wallet (that had $0 at the time) to a site when I was looking into ways to buy SOL. I had logged into ape.pro via the Phantom Wallet and I believe I had connected my wallet to uniswap. Something that stood out was there was a jupuary.jup.ag link in my history which I do not recall visiting and nothing prior to the website showing to indicate that I had purposely went out my way to visit.

Any ideas? Anyone able to look into the etherscan to find any clues as to who or what the wallet of the person who stole the money is?

Reddit,ethereum,HELP - I Need Private Client Server Communication in Web3,2025-01-21 01:22:01,"I won't go into all the fine details here, but the basic problem is I need a way for a client to pass a message to a server and receive a response without the server learning the IP of the client. The message is small and can fit into a tx payload with ease, but I do not want to spam messages into the chain. The server can know the Ethereum address of the client. The solution does not have to be Web3 native. The solution must run in a browser env ( IE I can not handle raw TCP comms at the low levels ). 

I have considered OHTTP via Cloudflare ( not sure if this will actually work in a browser though )

I have considered passing the messages using Txns in chain but hate this idea since it is slow and wasteful in terms of user resources and server resources.

I have considered XMTP but this system is still early stage and highly centralized - meaning it could go offline at any time.

I have considered IPFS but this is a huge pain to say the least and I would prefer to not use it.

I have considered Whisper ( or Wagmu I think is the new name ) but Whisper had terrible support back in the day and I fear it still might.

I have considered Tor but this can not be done in a browser.

I have considered I2P but this can not be done in a browser.

Honestly, at this point I would be happy with paying for a reverse proxy that strips all of the client IP address info and blackholes the logs but I can not find any well established services like this. I did try routing through Cloudflare but for some reason their system always includes the X-Forwarded-For or some variant header no matter what worker stripping or rule stripping you set up...

2. Will layer 2s work with anything Ethereum?  I got into using Dex’s because I wanted some of the mid and micro cap coins I couldn’t find on exchanges. (I have bought smaller cap coins on exchanges before, I know how risky they are price action wise. It’s only Dex’s and self custody that I’m new to).

i aleady loaded up more ETH but i it keeps telling me i need more for a transaction. In my understandings this has nothing to do wit gas fees cause they were like 0.0001 ETH so i dont understand where this is coming from and its frustrating.

Reddit,ethereum,Best Way to Stake Ethereum with a Small Portfolio?,2025-01-19 12:57:23,"Hi everyone,

I’m just starting to invest in Ethereum and exploring staking as a way to earn passive income. At the moment, the ETH part of my portfolio is really small—under $200. I’m doing DCA, so my holdings will gradually grow over time, but for now, it’s definitely modest.

I’ve done some research into staking options, but I must admit that I'm a a bit overwhelmed since I’m still a beginner. Having advice from experienced people would be really helpful.

What’s the best way to stake ETH with such a small amount? Should I simply stake it directly in the exchange until I have a bigger amount?

I want to choose a method that works well for small portfolios but I'm open to suggestions to transition into once it gets bigger. Thanks in advance for your insights! Looking forward to learning from you all.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum’s Scalability Paradox and the Forgotten Stakeholders: Investors,2025-01-19 10:37:51,"Let me just start by saying I am a big believer in the Ethereum ecosystem. I know that this post may be downvoted a lot, but I think it is important to raise these issues and constructively discuss them. That said, I am here to learn and I acknowledge that my understanding might be flawed. If that’s the case, I welcome your insights to help me understand better.

**1. Are L2s hurting Ethereum's tokenomics?**

Layer-2 solutions are critical for Ethereum's scalability, but they seem to be harming its economic model. L2s inherently designed to reduce Ethereum's base layer (or Layer-1) demand. Lower demand, means lower gas fees and by extension reduced burn rate with EIP-1559. Further limiting Eth's deflationary pressure. This can be visualized on Eth supply chart [here](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETH_SUPPLY/). 

With reduced demand, ETH’s price could stagnate or decline. This hurts all investors, validators included.

**2. Failing to understand that every Validator is Investor first.**

Validators are important for maintaining **security and decentralization** of Ethereum network. However, we fail to understand that every validator is an investor first (in a Proof Of Stake environment), and are only tied to the project until it is profitable for them. If Eth price continues to stagnate eventually they will move to other chains. Ultimately compromising Eth's Security and Decentralization. 

**3. Not enough focus on investors?**

I wholeheartedly agree and encouraged by changes in [EF leadership and goals](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1880635379771904423). However, would like to understand what does ""having a vested interest"" mean? Ethereum is a Proof of Stake network. Every validator, investor, developer and user have vested interest. 

I understand that EF is trying to eliminate any influence that large investors (institutional and individual) may have. However, they should be cautious not to ignore the role of the ""investor"" as an important actor contributing to the Ethereum network. 

**4. Community being too critical when investors voice their opinion on price movement.**

While there is a dedicated sub to discuss price movements r/ethtrader, sometimes it isn't that straight forward. When fundaments are not supporting price movements they should not just be discussed but should be encouraged. Often, people here who discuss price are looked down upon despite having very valid points. Community should understand that Ethereum is **Proof of Stake**, and ""Stake"" i.e. Eth as token is integral part of consensus mechanism. 

My hope with this post is to spark constructive discussion and, hopefully, bring about necessary changes if/where they are needed.

Edit: The post doesn’t discuss price increase/decrease, but rather discusses how change in fundamentals are affecting investors (i.e. validators, developers and users) in Eth token.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum Blobs - Calls for upgrades vs FUD,2025-01-18 17:25:54,"I'm seeing a lot of confusion and misunderstandings on other platforms regarding blobs so I thought I would cross-post this here.   
  
**Previous FUD** = There wouldn't be enough demand for Ethereum DA (blobs)  
**The Truth** = There is more than enough demand and it's growing  
  
**New FUD** = Ethereum won't be able to cope with demand and will either lose out to alt DA or (much) worse alt L1s.   
**The Truth** = Both the devs and the community are aware of the demand and have; Short/Mid/Longer-term solutions. Calls to action are not FUD but many are unaware that there are solutions and this is where the FUD is coming from. Layer 2s can also make trade offs and use ALT DA whilst still paying Ethereum Layer 1 for proofs this is still far better than users going to alt L1.   
  
Before I get into solutions let's cover the **basics of Blob vs Block Storage:**  
Blocks = Persistent = \~90KB on average   
Blobs = Temporary = 128KB Max  
Blob Market (current) = Target 3  / max 6 (per block)  
  
**- Short-Term Solution (Mid/Late March):**  
Pectra: Blob Market = Target 6  / max 9  
  
**- Longer-Term Solutions:**  
PeerDAS - using data availability sampling for blobs will dramatically increase supply to the blob market. Other solutions are being discussed with even longer time frames but these will evolve over time.   
  
**- Mid-Term Solutions:**  
Between Pectra and PeerDAS blobs and the blob market can be upgraded with a soft fork and/or a hard fork that only focuses on blobs requiring less testing and overhead (quicker to implement). These mid-term solutions will likely depend on the community pushing for them. Alternative DA options can still be Ethereum-aligned and will be part of the overall mix of solutions different use cases will likely require different solutions and implementations.   
  
**The Oversimplified Debate:**  
L2s don't pay enough vs L2s need to grow to compete  
  
**More thoughts from Intern:**   
This debate is often framed as 2 opposing ideologies but perhaps it is also 2 different time horizons. While it is true that Layer 2s are currently paying less than they have done historically whilst serving more users it is also true that the market has changed and expects cheaper transaction fees which are available outside the Ethereum ecosystem. Right now the Blob market is highly reactive but once the Blob market grows changes in demand will lead to a more proportionate change in costs and may ultimately result in more being paid to the Layer 1 over the long term. Put simply if fees paid to the L1 per transaction have been reduced by 1000X then if L2s can grow their transaction count by over 1000X then they will pay more overall but growth takes time, investment, and builders.

Reddit,ethereum,Make Blob sizes dynamic ?,2025-01-19 01:51:08,"Perhaps a noob question but:

Pectra is supposed to increase Blob sizes to accommodate more throughput and lower fees, however this will hurt the holders (less burn until more througput comes in).

**Why can't we make Blob sizes dynamic?**

\- Increase in size (automatically) when demand is needed and decrease it when demand is low in order to strike a balance to allow a healthy - constant burn of Eth.

Wasn't Ether supposed to be **Ultra sound** money?

I know we need to attract more projects to join in as L2s (by having lower fees), but if other L1s take ""our cake"" before we achieve our objective, we won't attract more L2s either ways.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474
Reddit,ethereum,ETH - Gas prices,2025-01-19 14:14:47,"Hey I'm fearly new to Crypto.

I currently have a 3 mid cap coins, that are only on the ethereum network. So the most efficient way to get these coins is through swapping them with ETH through the Ethereum main net.

Now ethereum gas prices are probably going to suw.

Is there a way to swap them in a ""bundle"" to ETH, just paying gas once? With a dapp maybe?

The gas prices will probably be just much as the amount I have in these coins even if they 2-3x from now 🫠.

I probably didn't use the right terms as I am new to this but would appreciate some suggestions.

Reddit,ethereum,What is the current state of Eth?,2025-01-19 16:18:32,"Hi,

I used to mine Eth and was a staunch advocate for the project from about 2018-2022. I loved the project! There was always a new drop or project launching on the network and it seemed like Eth would be the project to lead the decentralized DeFi future that I was invested in. I am not a miner that just quit because they went PoS, I was excited and bought the reasons why PoS was a positive. I do miss the insane profits I was getting from mining it, but I had accrued decent number of coins that I was ready to stake to continue the ecosystem. Then, it happened. PoS mainnet upgrade occurred and not only could I not mine, but it took two months for me to find a reputable staking pool.

Fast forward to 2022 and I had completed staking some coin and was left with very small gains in reference to the time I locked the coins up. No big deal, but what was the state of the project? Basically dead. What happened to PoS and the DeFi revolution that I believed in? Well, the insane amount of coin required to run a validator node led (everything from here on is my opinion/perception) to a situation where majority of node owners were the same financial institutions that I was hoping to stick it to. The rich now controlled block validation and the average joe's only option was to buy small amounts of coin and stake it on a pool, hoping it didn't get stolen. Feeling disillusioned with the project, I sold my coins.

It doesn't seem like the PoS move has done any of the proposed goals. The price is stagnant and I don't see the enthusiasm for projects and when I think about nodes I can't help but picture rich people just watching their holdings grow.

I still hold out hope, so what's going on? Anything exciting?",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

I have previously made the mistake of sending crypto to the wrong wallet way back in 2020. Last night in my attempts to convert USDC ETH to USDC SOL, I tried using Soflare to bridge my USDC. While I think it went through, I cannot for the life of me understand what is happening. Today my Coinbase Wallet shows I still own USDC ETH with the same balance, and Metamask shows the same. However when I try to send it, sell it, etc. I'm unable to do so. I THOUGHT the transaction went through, but was in such a rush to purchase the $TRUMP coin last night I had to go ahead and use a different app to get that purchase through. Today however I cannot seem to move my USDC, sell it, or do much of anything and I'm trying to understand what the heck happened. At this point I've spent several hours trying to figure this out, and would really appreciate some help.

Reddit,ethereum,Does Ethereum Foundation Really Doesn't Care About Numbers Go Down?,2025-01-18 21:23:46,"In this community people often shame me for only looking at the numbers and care about making profit, and their argument is always we have superior tech, more L1L2 usage, or metrics that doesn't help with profit.

The Ethereum dev circles are like a bunch of people that doesn't talk much about numbers, it seems like they don't care if the numbers go up or down, and to them building ""better"" product is the only thing important.

This entire community seems to force people to be ""in it for the tech"" and largely ignored investors and think they are shortsighted subpar human that are filled with greed and only care about profit.

From my perspective, Ethereum Foundation and dev circles see themselves as a higher tier elitist because they know the code, have higher moral standard and have the ability to build on the project, so they only communicate within themselves.

They also don't care about if other entity want to build project on Ethereum and not willing to give them even a little bit of recognition, and rarely talk about projects being built by third party on the network, for comparison look at Solana tweeter, they are actively interact with projects build on their network.

BUT the fact that Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum are able to grow to this size is largely because they benefits from numbers going up, Ethereum started with an ICO, crowdfunding from investors, and without numbers going up, they won't be able to grow as fast, won't be able to sell their ETH to pay their employee, fund their projects.

There's no tech company or tech project in this capitalism world doesn't care about numbers going up are able to sustain, to grow, to hire more talent, to increase adoption, to promote awareness.

If the numbers stop going up, eventually the funding will be dried up, talents will not waste their talent to build on the network if it won't be rewarded, and it will just slowly fade into irrelevance.

I think Ethereum Foundation should start allocate more fundings on their marketing department, and their business development department. Start talking to more businesses to consider building their project on the network, talking to more developers to build, interact more with anyone still have any interest in Ethereum, be it just investors that only cares about profit or businesses or coders, do more sponsorships, be more aggressive in marketing.

Attract more capital to expand and grow, provide more grant to promising project, etc

Stop shaming people only care about profits and numbers going up, these are investors, the only people still believe in the project and invested their money into project, stop telling them to fuck off because they complain about the numbers going down, in real world do we see tech company telling their VC to fuck off because their VC complain about non-performing?",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,ethereum,To Pump The Gas Or Not: Analyzing The Ethereum Gas Limit Debate,2025-01-17 20:56:20,"As Ethereum continues to evolve, one of the key topics being discussed is the proposal to increase the gas limit. This proposal has garnered a ton attention among the community for its potential to scale the network, reduce transaction fees, and enable new types of decentralized applications (dapps). However, a higher gas limit also raises important concerns about decentralization, validator hardware requirements, and overall network stability.

In this post, I’ve shared an article that delves into the origins of the proposal, potential benefits, and the challenges that come with it. The article covers:

- The history of past attempts to raise gas limits on Ethereum 
- How the gas limit could be gradually raised without a network fork
- Predictable effects of a higher gas limit, like lower gas fees and improved transaction flows
- The potential for new types of dapps, such as on-chain AI and large-scale token operations, to emerge if network capacity increases 
- Risks to decentralization and security, including validator hardware requirements and MEV disparities, and other potentially negative byproducts of higher gas limits

If you’re interested in a deep dive on the topic, check out the article and share your thoughts. What do you think about the gas limit increase? Could it help Ethereum scale without compromising its core principles?

Read the full report here: https://research.2077.xyz/to-pump-the-gas-or-not-analyzing-the-ethereum-gas-limit-debate-1

Reddit,ethereum,Questions About Layer 1’s,2025-01-17 04:40:01,"Hi everyone! I just got into self custody of my coins and swapping for newer/smaller tokens that aren’t listed on exchanges yet. 

This drove me to really want to understand how layer 1’s prices are driven up by the layers 2’s. For example, does Ethereum’s price go up because people are buying the layer 2’s and holding them? Or does it go up because of people holding stack of Ethereum’s to pay for gas fees? 

This is also making me wonder for example why Solana’s price has gone up compared to Ethereum (besides Ethereum gas fees), because even though Solana has cheaper gas fees, I don’t see the amount of legitimate projects on it compared to Solana. For example, every time I see a video on an up and coming AI project, gaming or any other hot niche it’s almost always on Ethereum. Is Solana just getting its boost in market cap off meme coins and/or big investors holding SOL just to hold combine with the narrative on better speed and gas fees?? 

This is NOT me hating on Ethereum. I’m just genuinely curious because Ethereum’s ecosystem is bigger and still continuing to get projects from my understanding.

Reddit,ethereum,Response from United States Senator to my email,2025-01-16 19:13:08,"I filled out one of those automated Coinbase ""Stand with Crypto"" emails and sent it to my Senator- Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire.

Response from her/her office below:

**""Dear XXX,**

**Thank you for contacting my office regarding cryptocurrency. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this important issue.**

**As you know, a cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that can in limited circumstances be used for purchases of goods and services, but can also be used for a variety of other purposes, including speculation. Unlike the dollar, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, cryptocurrencies use a distributed online ledger to secure and account for transactions. This means that users of cryptocurrencies have limited recourse through the traditional legal or financial system if, for example, an item purchased with cryptocurrency never arrives, or if the value of a particular cryptocurrency declines significantly.**

**Due to the rapid development of this new technology and proliferation of new types of cryptocurrencies and tokens, federal regulators have not yet taken meaningful steps to ensure that increased adoption of cryptocurrencies does not result in criminal or fraudulent use or threaten the stability of our financial system. While I believe it is important we allow for healthy innovation in this new technology, it is also important that we protect consumers against cryptocurrency fraud and scams and prevent criminal activity like ransomware demands or money laundering.** 

**Most legislation that would make changes to the regulation of cryptocurrency would be referred to either the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs or Senate Committee on Finance. I am not a member of either committee, but I am carefully monitoring developments in this nascent technology and should relevant legislation come before the full Senate for consideration, rest assured that I will keep your thoughts in mind.** 

**Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, and please do not hesitate to contact my office in the future.""**

**Sincerely,**

Jeanne Shaheen  
United States Senator",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474
Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Sorry to post here but I don't know where to post this as the binance sub is fully control by binance mods and I can't create a post and get answers from actual users.

I tried to close my binance (not binance us) account recently as I haven't really use it for years.

I followed the procedure and closed it and it said my account was closed.

However, I never received any confirmation email, which I find very odd, as they usually send emails for everything. Thus, considering some shady practices of exchanges and Binance's reputation, I wonder if they actually closed my account.

Have any of you ever closed a binance account  (not a binance us account) here and do you know if you received a confirmation by mail right away or later ?

It's also quite problematic as I need a proof my account was closed 

 I alao don't want to keep receiving airdrops and stuff which could have tax implications where I am from and which binance may continue to do if my account isn't really closed.

Reddit,bitcoin,crypto . com best alternatives to US residents,2025-01-24 18:58:48,"US Resident (California). 

Crypto . com consistently shows BTC at $1000 higher than other exchanges. I planned to LIMIT sell over 1 BTC, however i only found out today that crypto only lets me do $5k increments (20 orders per day), unless i'm a ""Plus"" member (i.e. $1M assets minimum) which is just ridiculous. When I do a market sell, suddenly the market rate is $3k less than ticker price.

BTC chart says $107,900.  Won't let me do .5 BTC limit sell because I'm not ""Plus"" member.  Go to Spot price, and .5 BTC is $52,500 - which is a $105,000 BTC price. That spread is absolutely ridiculous and completely scammy. 

  
Is there any other exchange that has better price spreads and no maximums on Limit Sells? ",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474
Reddit,bitcoin,Inflation in numbers: How much harder are we working? Comparing 1970s and 2025,2025-01-23 13:45:43,"How things have changed since the 1970s in terms of how much we work to afford basic things like housing and rent.

**Spoiler: We're working harder and earning much less for it!**


---

**1. Wages:**

1970 Average Hourly Wage: \~$3.50/hour

2025 Average Hourly Wage: \~$25.72/hour (U.S. national average)

Now, $3.50/hour in 1970 should be equivalent to around **$123/hour today**, based on the money supply increase (M2), which grew by a **35x factor** from 1970 to 2025.

In simple terms, to keep up with inflation and money supply growth, wages should have grown by about 35x times, not just 7 times as they have.


---

**2. Housing Affordability:**

1970 Average Home Price: \~$17,000

2025 Average Home Price: \~$374,900


Working Hours to Buy a Home:

1970s: 4,857 hours (at $3.50/hour)

2025: 14,580 hours (at $25.72/hour)

Home prices have increased by about **22x** since the 1970s, but wages have only increased about 7x.

If wages had kept pace with the 22x increase in housing prices, wages should be around **$77.18/hour**.

And these are just averages, we're not even looking at the ridiculous cities like: Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Miami, SFC, London, Sydney, Ottawa.


---

**3. Rent Affordability:**

1970 Median Monthly Rent: \~$108

2025 Median Monthly Rent: \~$2,000


Working Hours to Pay Rent:

1970s: 31 hours/month (at $3.50/hour)

2025: 78 hours/month (at $25.72/hour)

Rent has increased by about **18x** since the 1970s, while wages have increased by 7x. To match 1970s affordability, today's wage would need to be closer to **$64.50/hour**.


---


**4. The Changing Nature of Work:**

Today’s jobs are far more complex than in the 1970s, especially in fields like technology, finance, and engineering. For example:

Computer Engineers and Software Developers must not only possess years of education but also continually upgrade their skills to keep up with rapid technological change.

Stock Traders and Investment Bankers are under immense pressure to beat market returns and take on more risk to justify their pay. This requires constant analysis, long hours, and a high level of mental stress.

Many of these jobs have become headache-inducing as the demands increase and the pressure to perform is relentless.

These roles can often come with long working hours, high stress, and little downtime, but the pay doesn't reflect the level of education, output, or stress compared to the 1970s.

So for example, earning $55/hour as a Software Engineer, you are still making less than a Grocery Bagger in the 1970s, because you must work more hours to pay rent or buy a house.

Higher education vs. uneducated, high responsibility vs. no responsibility, and yet, you're working longer hours for less purchasing power.


---

**Key Takeaways:**

Money Supply & Inflation: The money supply (M2) has increased 35x from 1970 to 2025. If wages had kept up with that growth, today's wages should be about $123/hour.

Housing & Rent: While wages have increased by 7x, housing and rent prices have far outpaced that growth, making them much less affordable today than in the 1970s.

Working Harder for Less: Despite the increased complexity and higher educational demands in today’s jobs, we're still working harder, producing more results, and receiving less. Wages haven't kept pace with the mental and physical demands of modern jobs.

**What is a Fair Wage?** To compensate us for the higher complexity and greater output, we should be earning **MORE THAN** $123/hour today. The average salary should be closer to **$250/hour** to make all that education, experience accumulation, increased productivity and its related stress worthwhile.


---

**So in conclusion,** IF YOU ARE EARNING LESS THAN $250/hour, you are right to feel EXHAUSTED and CHEATED.

Considering that I'm a software engineer earning less than 1/5th of that, it explains and makes sense why I feel absolutely exhausted all the time, and can't even come close to owning a home or feel financially safe enough to start a family.

Reddit,bitcoin,I'm 44 and focused on retirement.  Should BTC be an after thought?,2025-01-23 06:58:37,"I just started buying BTC in late November 2024.  So, far I've put in about $3000.  I'm currently in a position where I can invest $2,000 a month to whatever I want.

At the time, I wasn’t even considering the possibility of Bitcoin being recognized as a strategic reserve by companies, states, or even countries.

Now, it seems that’s exactly what’s unfolding. The President of the United States, cabinet members, senators, congressmen, bankers, and industry experts are all starting to grasp the strategic advantage. I never imagined this when I began buying.

And yet, the most surprising part? The market remains unmoved. I feared that as this recognition grew, I’d find myself paying 50%, 100%, or even 500% more for the same amount of sats.

Reddit,bitcoin,Mistakes & What This BTC Mom Did Right Hodling for 10+ years,2025-01-22 20:00:13,"TLDR: Put in what you can afford, don’t obsess over price or even check if you can help it, continue investing. Don’t let your ego stop you from increasing your cost basis.

First of all, in 2013 when I got into BTC, this was one of the first places I came to find out what it was all about. Thought I’d write some thoughts that may or may not be helpful to a newbie. 

I came across Bitcoin in late 2013 when I had a newborn and was home with small children. I’m the type of person who researches things to the death and kind of go on kicks when I find something interesting. I put in a lot of reading and came to the conclusion it would either go to nothing or 1 million+. I got my husband on board by explaining it as best I could and by convincing him to put an amount we could afford to lose. He agreed to let me put some money in and it would be up to me to decide how to manage.

The best thing I ever did was consider that money spent and not obsessing over the price.  When it tanked I was able to say “oh well. Let’s see how it turns out.”  I honestly only check the price when I hear about bitcoin on the news or others talking about it and it has turned out how to be an excellent top indicator for sure. With a long term strategy I never panicked that the top was over because I was in it for the longterm.

I sold some one time to get some expensive equipment for a business/hobby that has brought me great enjoyment and been really great for my family. I don’t regret taking that amount of profit but I would only have done it this once, and again I should have kept investing after. I live like I did before. I drive a 15 year old vehicle, live in modest house, and work full time.

The worst thing I ever did is that I didn’t keep on buying after initial investment. Due to me promising my husband I wouldn’t keep putting more in after initial investment, I missed out on a ton of gains. We could be financially free now instead of just having a really good amount saved. I’m glad I kept my word to him but I could have found other amounts to put in and he would have agreed over the years. Don’t let pride of your entry price stop you from continuing to invest what you can afford (and what you can afford to not touch minimum 4 years).

Now, I have a strategy that I will never go below a certain percentage of my holding, and I will only do so for a couple reasons:

1- to see my husband leave his high stress physically demanding job. He is the hardest worker in the world and I lucked out on him more than I ever did finding bitcoin early. I would love to surprise him by paying off the mortgage without him knowing in advance! I will do this for 20% of my holdings when it gets there. I know it would be better left and the mortgage paid off with fiat, but time with him gained would be worth it.

2- My kids are the best. The oldest is a talented and hard working teen. She spends hours and hours as a ballerina and also earns straight As. She wants to be a surgeon one day and I hope that my investment will be enough to send her to a good university. Right now she is under impression she will have to pay for it all. One other thing is I want more than anything to take her to see her favorite ballerina live before she retires. She also is obsessed with ancient history and particularly Ancient Rome. One day we will do an epic trip to see ruins and different sites. But I will only do this if I can do this with a very small percent of my holding. My other kids are young enough I’m hoping I can have enough when they get to university age.

Best of luck to you all. Keep stacking sats! I’m working on increasing my cost basis and putting in what I can afford.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

But I will say it’s easy to look at the current marketcap of $6B which is “below lots of other meme coins” and think it has room to grow. But you’re playing against the clock, the circulating supply will be doing a 5x over the next years and if it was fully distributed right now the fully distributed marketcap would still be over $31B and it would be a top ten crypto asset by marketcap.

It might not be this time but at some point you’re going to get trapped. When coins have immediate mass inflation (see Algorand inflating 400% in 2021) it will inevitably create lots and lots of bag holders.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

The Ripple/XRP ""blockchain"" is broken since the first 32,569 blocks are ""lost"". The company **deleted** all those blocks.

This company has been aggressively promoting CBDC for years, funded media attacks on Bitcoin using money they got by dumping their premined shitcoin, and now they're spending their premined loot in DC to lobby against Bitcoin and pushing for corporate-issued CBDC.

If there's a ""cryptocurrency"" that is the sworn nemesis of everything Bitcoin stands for, it's Ripple. By far, the most blatant scam in the industry.

Ripple has no reason to even use a blockchain except to deceive people into a false notion of affinity to Bitcoin.

EDIT:

For those saying the murder for hire thing was debunked/he wasn't convicted of it, here's a passage from page 33 of the 2016 appellate decision upholding his conviction:

""At the sentencing hearing, the district court resolved several disputed issues of fact. For example, because Ulbricht contested his responsibility for the five commissioned murders for hire, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Ulbricht did in fact commission the murders, believing that they would be carried out. The district court characterized the evidence of the murders for hire, which included Ulbricht’s journal, chats with other Silk Road users, and the evidence showing that Ulbricht actually paid a total of $650,000 in Bitcoins for the killings, as “ample and unambiguous.” App’x 1465.""

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What do you think about UTXO Stack? (BTC Liquidity Staking Protocol + Stablecoin on Lightning Network),2025-01-24 22:50:42,"

The team behind Nervos Network (CKB) has proposed UTXO Stack, a decentralized liquidity staking layer to tackle the limitations of the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), such as liquidity issues, onboarding barriers, and the lack of stablecoin support. Their approach integrates the LN with the Fiber Network to create a Hybrid Network, introducing stablecoins, automated liquidity management, and zero-cost channel opening.

Key features include:

1. **Decentralized Liquidity Staking Pool (DLSP):** Improves liquidity efficiency by enabling liquid staking derivatives and automated management.
2. **Hybrid Network:** Integrates LN with Fiber Network for stablecoin support and better connectivity, so you can pay with bitcoin and merchant receives USD stablecoin
3. **Zero-Cost Onboarding:** Simplifies LN adoption by advancing funds for channel setup.

They also propose use cases like decentralized swaps, AI agent payments, and composability with DeFi. The project aims to create a scalable, user-friendly payment system aligned with Web5 principles.

What do you think about this solution? Can it truly address LN's challenges and drive mass adoption?

The protocol uses transaction fees and circulating supply subsidies to fairly distribute rewards, enhancing the ecosystem's sustainability and incentivization structure.

This update represents a significant milestone in further decentralizing the Algorand network. Since its implementation, the network has seen an 89% increase in active nodes, with the United States, Germany, and Great Britain accounting for 58% of total node activity. By empowering more participants to contribute to the network's operations, this upgrade not only strengthens security but also reinforces Algorand's commitment to being a robust, decentralized, and inclusive blockchain.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Is Day Trading Bitcoin for Small Price Swings Feasible?,2025-01-25 00:45:46,"

**TLDR:** Can you profit from Bitcoin's daily price fluctuations if you have 1 Bitcoin?

I've been keeping an eye on Bitcoin's price lately, and I've noticed it fluctuates quite a bit. This is just the price I see on Google, so I’m sure there might be slight differences on exchanges.

Hypothetically speaking, would it be feasible to sell Bitcoin when the price is high, then buy back in when it drops lower? I know the market can be volatile, and I’m not talking about waiting days or weeks, but more in the span of a single day. The other day, I saw a $12,000 swing in price.

Since October, the average daily fluctuations in Bitcoin's price have been around $6900 NZD. Taking that into account, if you set a target of, say, $1,000 NZD profit per trade and stick to it, you could potentially buy and sell based on those fluctuations. With 1 Bitcoin, that could mean a decent profit just from catching smaller price swings each day.

I realize this strategy is risky, but do you think it could work, especially if you’re consistent and don’t wait for the price to hit some extreme high or low? For example, setting a target price and executing based on that.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Can a Layer 1 Blockchain Be Rugpulled?,2025-01-24 08:36:54,"Hey everyone,

I've recently stumbled upon a meme blockchain project that caught my eye. Interestingly, it's a **Layer 1 blockchain with Proof-of-Work** with a pretty low market cap (around 60M$). That project is existing since more then 1 year and is still very active.

 I'm considering investing a bit into it, but I have some concerns. **I don't want to make any advertisment, so I'm not telling which project it is.** 

Can a Layer-1-PoW blockchain be rugpulled? If so, how does that happen?

I understand that rug pulls are more common in DeFi projects, or L2-Tokens, but I'm curious if the same risks apply to Layer 1 blockchains. What should I be looking out for to avoid getting scammed?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Decentralized Dreams,2025-01-24 07:52:05,"Honestly, DePINs sound like they could be a game-changer, right? Like, imagine we could all have a say in how our internet or energy works, without some big corporation pulling the strings. It's a nice thought, this idea that we could all come together to make things better, more accessible, and maybe even cheaper.

But let's cut the idealism with a dose of reality. First off, getting everyone to agree on anything is like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. Then there's the whole mess with laws and regulations that weren't written with this kind of stuff in mind. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, and that can slow things down big time.

And let's not forget trust. We're so used to having one company or government to blame when things go wrong. With DePINs, if something breaks, who do you yell at? It's a bit like a community garden; everyone loves the idea until they realize they have to actually do the work.

There's also the tech side. Blockchain and all that jazz? It's cool, but it's not without its headaches. Energy use, the complexity of making sure everything's secure... it's not just plug-and-play.

So while I'm all for shaking up the system, I'm also not naive enough to think it's going to be all smooth sailing. It's like being excited for a road trip but knowing you might have to deal with flat tires along the way.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht might still have around 430 Bitcoin worth over $47 million across several wallets.,2025-01-22 21:42:58,"Recently pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht might still have around 430 Bitcoin worth over $47 million across several wallets. According to blockchain researcher Conor Grogan, he has identified several wallets associated with Ulbricht holding the BTC.

Grogan shared the news on X, noting that these wallets have not been touched in the last 13 years, a sign that the US government did not confiscate them. The US government had recovered around 50,000 Bitcoin from Ulbricht when he was arrested in 2013 for operating the darknet marketplace.

He wrote:

“I found ~430 BTC across dozens of wallets associated with Ross Ulbricht that were not confiscated by the USGovt and have been untouched for 13+ years. Back then these were probably dust wallets, now, collectively, they are worth about $47M.”

However, Grogan added that Ulbricht likely does not have the keys to those wallets, which is why the government could not gain access to them. Still, the uncovering of BTC connected to Ulbricht has led to speculations as to what impact the selling of BTC could have on his pardon. Some users noted that he cannot sell the BTC even if he has the keys since the assets are proceeds from a crime.

Meanwhile, others have criticized Grogan for disclosing the information, noting that the addresses should be kept private. In response, the researcher noted that the addresses are already public as they were cited in the trial documents, and many people are likely tracking them.

Crypto community praises Ross Ulbricht’s release

Still, the crypto community has been celebrating Ross Ulbricht’s release since President Trump announced his full pardon. For many, the decision represents Trump’s commitment to the crypto industry and also vindicates the use of decentralized and privacy-oriented applications. The pardon coincides with the US Court decision to lift the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction on crypto mixer Tornado Cash.

Bitcoin advocate Ben Sigman noted that the Ulbricht release is a major win against government overreach and a well-deserved justice. In a long post on X, Sigman, who wrote the Big Bitcoin Book, defended Ulbricht, noting that while Silk Road might have been problematic, the punishment against him was also disproportionate.

He wrote:

“This isn’t just about Ross or a marketplace—it’s about government overreach and the state’s power to crush individuals with vague laws.”

Others, such as early Bitcoin adopter Jameson Loop, also thanked President Donald Trump for the decision. He wrote:

“Thank you, @POTUS. I hereby grant you a full and unconditional pardon for all past and future shitcoinery.”

With Ulbricht now released, many people have started donating funds to him as he attempts to restart his life. Over $130,000 has been raised through the official Free Ross campaign, with one person recently donating one BTC to the cause. Strike also launched a merch in his honor, with 100% of the proceeds after expenses donated to him.

Meanwhile, not all reactions to his release have been positive. There are several people on X who have questioned his pardon, noting that Ulbricht indeed committed crimes. Some bad actors have also tried to exploit his release to launch memecoins but a statement from his official X account already denied any affiliation with a memecoin.

""Going Concern

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net loss of $610,291. The Company was not able to cover its operational costs with the product and services sales generated and will likely need to further invest in marketing for user acquisition to increase COIN App income and advertising revenue to reach break-even for its products and services. As a result, the Company may incur further operating losses and seek to fund its operations through equity and/or debt financing or other sources, as it deems necessary.

Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, including due to general macroeconomic conditions or unforeseen factors. If the Company fails to raise capital or generate liquidity through the sale of its products and services, it will have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies.

Every block proposed will pay out 10 ALGO + 50% of block transaction fees.",2025-01-23 02:10:19,"Tomorrow marks a titanic shift in the future of Algorand and decentralization. This is one of the biggest updates in Algorand history. The network will now reward participants who propose blocks! Algorand is unique because of the following:

* **No slashing risk**
   * Staked Algo is not subject to slashing. Instead, ineffective nodes are algorithmically removed from consensus and simply forgo rewards.
* **No lockup period**
   * On Algorand, independent validators maintain control of their Algo at all times. Staked tokens remain in a user’s wallet while securing the network as part of consensus.
* **Low cost**
   * Running a node on Algorand is extremely cheap. All you need is a computer with 16GB of RAM, fast SSD, and 1 Gbps internet connection.
* **Real-time rewards**
   * The initial rewards for block proposers are 10 Algo + 50% of txn fees per block. On Algorand, rewards are paid out as each block is finalized, every 2.8 seconds, and your stake automatically compounds, instantly increasing your voting power.

**Why is this huge?**

This will make Algorand one of the most **egalitarian**, **democratic**, and **decentralized** blockchains in the world. You don't need a data center or crazy hardware to run a node. Anyone can run one on a mediocre laptop or minipc! Algorand to me lives up to the ideals of Satoshi, anyone, anywhere can help secure the chain and liberate themselves from the shackles of traditional finance. This brings us one step closer to the dream of a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Now, lets get into the weeds!

Recommended system specification for **participation** nodes is:

* 8 vCPU
* 16 GB RAM
* 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
* 1 Gbps connection with low latency

Personally I run my own on a Beelink Minipc and it runs flawlessly (https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs). Please note, this is above the required specs and you can find cheaper ones that will run flawlessly.

There will be many options for node running depending on whether you have access to the required hardware and ALGO requirements.

1. **Solo staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * By running an Algorand node you become an active contributor to this decentralized system. Your node, acting as an independent validator, helps prevent fraudulent activity and ensures only valid transactions are added to the blockchain. Node runners contribute to ensuring the robustness of Algorand infrastructure which benefits developers, applications, and users across the ecosystem.Participating nodes also have voting rights on network proposals, allowing you to have a direct say in Algorand’s future development.
2. **Liquid staking (any Algo amount)**
   * Liquid staking applications allow users to stake their Algo while maintaining liquidity. While each platform is unique, the typical process asks users to deposit Algo and mint new tokens that represent the ownership and value of the staked Algo and can be used across the [DeFi ecosystem](https://algorand.co/ecosystem/defi). 
3. **Staking pools (any Algo amount)**
   * Staking pools enable groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to stake their Algo to a validator and get rewarded based on the rewards the validator receives. Unique staking options are also available, such as staking via DEX liquidity pools (which requires committing Algo plus another asset). 
4. **Delegated staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * Delegated staking involves utilizing a third-party to run a node on the your behalf while your Algo remains your wallet at all times. This provides an option for users who want to help secure the network and collect rewards, but don’t have the knowledge or resources to run their own node.

If you choose to run your own node, there are many different options for getting your node up and running. From command line interface purism to one-click solutions. Currently, I use FUNC, which is a one click option for Windows that is extremely simple and easy.

* https://algorand.co/run-a-node
   * Nodekit (https://nodekit.run/)
   * FUNC (https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func)
   * A1C (https://github.com/AustP/austs-one-click-node/releases)
   * Manuel Installation (https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/)

The minimum amount needed to run your own node and get rewards is 30,000 ALGO. Keep in mind, you can still run your own node with a lower amount, **as little as .1 ALGO**, you just will not get rewarded.

If you don't have the required 30,000 ALGO you can put your ALGO in a liquid staking pool and get rewards. There will be many different platforms to do so. Below is a non-exhaustive list.

* Pera Algo Wallet (https://perawallet.app/?download=true)
* Folks Finance (https://app.folks.finance/liquid-staking)
* Tinyman (https://app.tinyman.org/liquid-stake)
* Pact (https://www.pact.fi/)
* CompX (https://app.compx.io/staking-pools)
* Messina One (https://messina.one/liquid-staking)
* Valar (https://stake.valar.solutions/)



You will also have the ability to setup your OWN pools and let people stake to your pools via Reti Pooling. The Réti Pooling protocol facilitates the creation of decentralized staking pools on the Algorand network, enabling groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to trustlessly stake to a Validator and earn yield based on the rewards the Validator receives.

* [https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme](https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme)
* [https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti](https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti)



I also assume the major exchanges will allow you to earn a percentage back on any ALGO you keep on an exchange.

Help be a part of decentralizing Algorand and get paid in the process!

**Exciting times are ahead! I hope you're Reti!**

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Future of AI in Fintech: HPL and mAInd - A Bullish Outlook,2025-01-23 21:03:10,"I recently stumbled upon an intriguing X (formerly Twitter) thread between TheRoaringAI and fintechjunkie discussing the potential of Human Programming Language (HPL) and its application within an AI system called mAInd. Here's why I'm absolutely bullish on this development:

1. **Innovative Approach to AI**: TheRoaringAI's work on HPL isn't just about programming AI to influence human behavior; it's about understanding human actions to predict future trends. This bidirectional approach could revolutionize how we use AI in fintech for predictive analytics, making investment decisions more informed and proactive.
2. **Real-World Application**: The conversation highlighted that HPL is not just theoretical. TheRoaringAI pointed out that fintechjunkie's engagement serves as a practical example of HPL in action, proving its viability. This real-world application signals that we're on the brink of seeing AI tools that can shape financial markets by anticipating consumer behavior and market trends.
3. **Potential for Market Disruption**: With mAInd, AI doesn't just react to market trends but shapes them. Imagine AI systems that can guide investment strategies, optimize trading algorithms, or even influence consumer financial habits towards more sustainable or profitable outcomes. This is game-changing for fintech, offering a competitive edge to those who adopt this technology early.
4. **Community Engagement**: The interaction shows a vibrant community of experts like fintechjunkie who are eager to discuss, debate, and develop these concepts further. This level of engagement from industry insiders suggests a strong foundation of support and interest, which bodes well for the technology's adoption and evolution.
5. **Investment Opportunity**: For investors, this could represent a significant opportunity. Companies that leverage HPL and mAInd could lead the next wave of fintech innovation, potentially becoming the next big names in the sector. Watching this space could be crucial for those looking to invest in cutting-edge technology with broad applications.

I'm super excited about where this could go. The blend of AI with human behavior analysis through HPL could redefine financial services, making them more personalized, predictive, and powerful. Let's keep an eye on TheRoaringAI and fintechjunkie for more insights, as their work might just be the catalyst for the next fintech boom!

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,Hashing conundrums,2024-12-20 20:49:23,"I have two questions about hashing that I thought might as well be merged into one post.

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

I wanted to reach out and apologize for removing my recent post about AMBER256. Upon reflection, I realized that I currently lack the necessary expertise to develop a robust cryptographic algorithm. My intention was never to spread an unsound or insecure algorithm, and I believe it's important to prevent the dissemination of potentially flawed cryptographic methods.

Before I revisit this project, I plan to dedicate significant time to studying existing implementations and understanding possible attacks. My goal is to ensure that any future contributions I make are both meaningful and secure.

I am sincerely sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. I also want to thank everyone who offered support and constructive feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your understanding.

Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to engaging with the community again once I have gained more knowledge in this field.",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474
Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-01-25 00:48:04.923474

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21).

And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
