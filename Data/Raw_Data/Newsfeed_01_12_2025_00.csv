This substantial purchase comes amid Dogecoin’s bullish recovery in key metrics, as analysts project a significant push to the upside.  Dogecoin Whales Buy 470 Million DOGE Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X (formerly Twitter) on January 11 that Dogecoin whales have begun accumulating again. Martinez announced the latest DOGE acquisition by these deep-pocketed investors, highlighting that Whales recently bought over 470 million tokens.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible This substantial DOGE purchase, which occurred in the last 48 hours, is valued at approximately 155 million based on current market prices. Such large-scale whale activity often signals a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency, potentially influencing market sentiment and trends. Martinez shared a chart presenting data related to Dogecoin, focusing on the behavior of whales holding assets spanning from 10 million to 100 million DOGE. The shaded area on the chart highlights the cumulative holdings of these wallets owning millions of DOGE.  Around late December 2024, Dogecoin whale holdings were relatively stable but began increasing significantly in early January 2025. CEO, a crypto analyst on X, commented on this surging accumulation trend, highlighting that whales have purchased over 1 billion Dogecoin in the last seven days.  Martinez’s chart also shows that large amounts of Dogecoin were purchased between $0.314 and $0.355. These prices highlight areas where Dogecoin experienced notable volatility and a slight pullback, presenting a buying opportunity for investors. Dogecoin previously surged to new highs above $0.4 in 2024. However, a steep correction pushed its price back towards the $0.3 mark.  Interestingly, the 470 million Dogecoin purchased by whales comes as the cryptocurrency experiences a steady bullish recovery in significant metrics. Crypto analyst Javon Marks disclosed that Dogecoin is forming a new Descending Wedge pattern. Additionally, a market expert on X, identified as ‘Rose Premium Signals,’ has revealed that Dogecoin’s macro charts are signaling a strong bullish structure as it accumulates near key support zones and aligns with long-term Fibonacci levels. DOGE Forms New Descending Wedge Pattern As mentioned earlier, Dogecoin is currently forming a new Descending Wedge pattern, signaling another potential price breakout. Marks stated in his X post that the popular meme coin is well positioned to continue another substantial bullish trend once it breaks out of this Descending Wedge pattern.  Related Reading: Is Dogecoin’s 30% Decline A Chance To Buy On Discount? Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch A Descending Wedge, also known as a Falling Wedge, is a technical chart pattern that indicates the potential for a price reversal or continuation. It is a bullish pattern that typically occurs during a downtrend, with its completion marked by a breakout above the upper trendline.  Marks predicts that if Dogecoin breaks above the Descending Wedge pattern, it could hit a new ATH soon, reflecting a potential 120% increase. The analyst has revealed that this massive price gain could happen anytime soon, pushing Dogecoin from its current market price of $$0.33 to a new bullish target of $0.739.

The altcoin leader’s decline comes amid heightened market volatility and uncertainty, with many investors reevaluating their positions following the recent selloff. However, despite the downturn, on-chain data suggests that underlying investor sentiment remains robust. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum saw significant outflows from exchanges this week, with net outflows surpassing $1.4 billion—the highest level since November. Such activity often signals strong accumulation trends as investors move their holdings off exchanges and into cold storage or other wallets, indicative of long-term confidence in the asset. These substantial outflows underscore Ethereum’s resilience even amid challenging price action. Analysts are closely monitoring whether these accumulation trends can offset the bearish momentum and spark a recovery in the coming weeks.  With Ethereum trading near critical support levels, the next moves will be pivotal in determining the direction of its price in 2025. As bullish seasonality for altcoins often kicks in during post-halving years, many believe that Ethereum could soon reclaim its upward trajectory, contingent on both market conditions and broader macroeconomic factors. Ethereum Prepares For Rebound Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after its recent drop, now attempting to break above the $3,300 level. The altcoin leader has faced considerable challenges, with a 15% decline from its recent highs putting pressure on bullish sentiment. However, key on-chain metrics indicate that Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong, pointing toward potential growth in the coming months. Data from IntoTheBlock, shared on X, highlights a significant development: this week saw net $ETH outflows from exchanges exceeding $1.4 billion, the highest level since November. Such substantial outflows often signal that investors are moving their holdings off exchanges, a behavior typically associated with accumulation. This trend suggests that, despite recent bearish price action, confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential remains intact. While Ethereum’s recent price action may appear underwhelming to some, these accumulation trends provide a bullish underpinning for the asset. Historically, large exchange outflows have preceded significant price rallies, as reduced sell-side liquidity can drive upward momentum when demand increases. Related Reading: Dogecoin Testing Key Demand Zone – Can DOGE Push Above $0.40? As Ethereum works to reclaim higher levels, breaking above $3,300 could signal the beginning of a more sustained recovery. With strong fundamentals and growing investor confidence, Ethereum appears well-positioned for a potentially bullish 2025. However, the asset must navigate current market volatility to confirm its uptrend. Testing Weekly Demand  Ethereum is trading at $3,250, reflecting ongoing struggles to break above the $3,300 resistance level. The price action remains tentative as ETH tests critical weekly demand levels. This area has historically provided strong support, and if Ethereum manages to close above the $3,100 mark, it could pave the way for a meaningful rebound in the coming days. The current consolidation phase highlights a market looking for direction. For bulls to regain control, Ethereum must break above key resistance levels. Reclaiming the $3,750 mark is crucial to confirm a bullish breakout and signal a potential uptrend. Such a move would not only restore investor confidence but also position ETH to retest higher levels as market sentiment shifts. However, failure to hold the $3,100 demand zone could lead to further downside pressure, with lower support levels likely to be tested. The coming sessions will be pivotal as Ethereum navigates these key levels.  Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk?

As Bitcoin has just crossed $94,000, Ethereum also shows signs of life and bounces back from its recent low and hints at the possibility of price explosion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $95k: Analyst Says It’s a Golden Time to Accumulate—Here’s Why A Quick Look At The Patterns Well-known crypto analyst Ali Martinez has found a bullish reversal pattern that can potentially take the price of Ethereum into much higher value. Trading at $3,281 at the moment, Ethereum has slipped below the middle line of its rising channel and has traders spooked. But Martinez is one who thinks if Ethereum could just retest the lower boundary at $2,800 and rebound, it will likely launch into a bullish trend. This rebound may eventually set the stage for Ethereum to reach between $6,000 and $7,000. If #Ethereum $ETH is following an ascending parallel channel, a dip to the lower boundary at $2,800 could act as a launchpad for a move toward $6,000. pic.twitter.com/uYP6BW3DZh — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Market Sentiment & Challenges Even though these are all good signs, the mood in the futures market right now is not clear. Open interest in Ethereum has gone down by 1.25%, which shows that some buyers are becoming more cautious. The long-to-short number is still less than 1, which means that traders are betting against Ethereum instead of for it. Also, funding rates have gone down a lot, which shows that people are less interested in taking leveraged long bets. Although short-term sentiment may be negative, long-term holders may see attractive entry points at current prices. Due to their inherent volatility, cryptocurrencies require constant vigilance and awareness of market trends. Key Resistance Levels All eyes will be on Ethereum’s performance and whether it can overcome important resistance thresholds as we advance into 2025. Several elements determine whether one may achieve $6,000 or even $7,000: market conditions, investor mood, and more general economic impact. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,274, down 0.9% and 9.9% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back?

Ether is expected to rise by a solid 93% in six months and 94% in three months, according to predictions by CoinCheckup.

In line with the general crypto market, XRP appears to be stuck in a range-bound market as more speculations arise on the viability of the current crypto bull run. However, XRP market analysts also remain bullish with recent predictions continuing to back a two-digit price target for the asset. Related Reading: 300 Million XRP On The Move: Ripple Labs Sparks Speculation How XRP Can Swing Based On XRP/BTC Chart – Analyst In an X post on January 10, popular XRP analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted several potential bullish scenarios for altcoin based on its performance in relation to Bitcoin. Earlier in May 2024, Egrag Crypto had stated that XRP and Bitcoin are mixing like the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans with distinct charts and trends yet still interacting significantly with the other. Based on these interactions as seen in the XRP/BTC chart, price projections for the altcoin are highly bullish.  However, introducing a baseline conversion price of Bitcoin at $120,000, there are three possible uptrend scenarios for XRP based on previous price performance. In a moderate scenario A based on historical data from 2017, Egrag Crypto states XRP could gain by 1,264% pushing the XRP/BTC ratio approximately 0.000107. This circumstance translates into a potential XRP price of $12. According to historical data from 2017, Egrag highlights a strongly bullish scenario B where XRP’s price could rise by 3,600% resulting in a XRP/BTC ratio around 0.000247 and a market price of $29. The final scenario C which is more conservative and based on XRP’s performance in 2021 shows a “mere” 500% gain that produces a ratio of 0.000041, resulting in a potential XRP price of $5. Related Reading: What To Expect After The Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Crypto Expert’s Prediction Points To $27 Target Based on a mix of all these scenarios, Egrag drops a personal forecast in which the XRP/BTC ratio is expected to first rise to between 0.00007 and 0.00010,  indicating a potential price of $8.5 – $12 for the altcoin. Thereafter, the crypto analyst expects a correction before the ratio races to around 0.00014 at which XRP may trade between $17 – $27. At press time, XRP trades at $2.34 following a 2.78% gain as earlier stated. However, daily trading volume is down by 15.20% and currently valued at $5.35 billion. Meanwhile, the coin’s performance on larger timeframes indicates turbulence in recent weeks as evidenced by losses of 4.65% and 3.69% in the past seven and thirty days respectively. Albeit, with a market cap of $134.74 billion, XRP ranks as the fourth largest crypto asset. Featured image from Blockzeit, chart from Tradingview",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum Exchange Outflows Hits 2-Month High With $1.4 Billion Withdrawn, What This Means",2025-01-11 18:30:10+00:00,"New reports have revealed a massive exodus of Ethereum (ETH) tokens from various crypto exchanges. IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data shows that over $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum has been withdrawn from exchanges. This large-scale ETH outflow marks one of the largest in recent months, signaling a potential shift in investor behavior. Ethereum Exchanges See Massive Outflows IntoTheBlock, a crypto analytics platform, reported that over $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum was recently moved out of crypto exchanges. This large-scale transfer usually occurs when investors buy a cryptocurrency from an exchange and move it to their private wallets rather than storing it on the centralized exchange.  Related Reading: Is Dogecoin’s 30% Decline A Chance To Buy On Discount? Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch Considering the sheer amount of ETH involved, investors may be planning to hold onto their assets rather than sell them. Data for IntoTheBlock indicates that approximately 74% of ETH investors have been HODLing for over a year, highlighting a widespread trend amongst investors to retain their assets.  The last time Ethereum exchanges experienced outflows at such a high level was in November 2024. At the time, Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) were the highlight of the market, experiencing massive gains following Donald Trump’s win in the United States (US) Presidential elections.  In contrast, Ethereum saw less impressive gains, struggling to break through resistance levels to reach new highs. Given ETH’s current volatility and price fluctuations, it would not be surprising if investors decided to sell off their holdings to prevent potential losses. However, the reverse seems to be the case, as these investors are holding on to their assets, possibly banking on a possible price increase in the future.  Confirming the massive ETH outflows from exchanges, CryptoQuant highlighted a decrease in overall selling pressure in the Ethereum market. The blockchain analytics platform disclosed that while inflows and outflows have increased slightly, net flows stay negative.  IntoTheBlock also shows that inflows have increased by 43.07% over the past week, while outflows have surged by a whopping 57.35%. Ethereum’s large holder netflow remains negative, decreasing by 26.35% over the past week and 47.60% in the last 30 days.  Interestingly, there have also been severe outflows from Ethereum Spot ETFs, with Wu Blockchain revealing that the total net outflow of these ETFs has increased to $68.47 million. Analyst Unveils Bearish Ethereum Price Prediction ‘More Crypto Online (MCO), a crypto community on X, has shared a bleak Ethereum price forecast, projecting a direct decline in line with the third wave of the Elliott Wave theory. According to the analyst, Ethereum will likely remain in its current consolidation phase through the weekend as its Wave 2 unfolds.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible The analyst has presented potential targets for the projected decline in Wave 3, with significant levels at 100%, 123.6%, and 138%. If Ethereum experiences a decline to these degrees, its price could crash to $2,841, $2,660, and $2,555, respectively.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead,2025-01-11 17:00:16+00:00,"Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, has recently made comments regarding the potential of Bitcoin to become a global monetary standard, similar to gold, which have sparked controversy. This viewpoint is gathering momentum, particularly as the debate regarding a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve intensifies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K The Future Of Finance: The Role Of Bitcoin Sigel stated that Bitcoin has the potential to significantly influence the future of global finance. He asserts that the establishment of a crypto strategic reserve by the United States government, with an estimated quantity of 1 million BTC, could establish the leading crypto asset as a new form of currency. This concept is reminiscent of historical periods in which nations accumulated gold in order to fortify their economic capabilities. Sigel posits that this could catapult the US to become the flag-bearer of the new era of finance. The gold standard once defined reserve assets. Now, Bitcoin presents the opportunity to converge on a ‘Digital Standard’ for money. It could very well echo gold’s role in reshaping global finance. pic.twitter.com/e1ogPe947R — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) January 10, 2025 Gold Vs. Bitcoin: Lessons From History The comparison of crypto to gold is not new, but it has gained traction recently as more governments experiment with digital currencies. Gold is often seen as a safe haven and a reliable store of wealth, but Bitcoin offers unique benefits that no other commodity does. It is essentially a digital asset, thus unlike gold, transfers are fast and considerably more portable. This digital nature makes it less vulnerable to physical theft and facilitates cross-border transactions. While mining helps to produce gold, Bitcoin is intrinsically rare since its supply is limited at 21 million coins. For those trying to offset economic uncertainty and inflation, this planned scarcity could make BTC a tempting substitute. Global Perspectives & Reactions There is a growing global buzz about the potential of Bitcoin. Due to recent political shifts in the US, countries like El Salvador have made Bitcoin legal tender, and leaders in other nations are trying to put similar policies into place. However, given the erratic character of Bitcoin and the steady purchasing power of gold, some economists believe that this movement should be rejected. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? Although Bitcoin offers contemporary benefits like decentralization and immunity to governmental intervention, its price volatility, according to critics, may be a barrier to its widespread adoption as a medium of exchange. As a result, the two assets differ in the crucial factors that investors and decision-makers need to take into account. Sigel’s words reflect a new interest in how Bitcoin might reconfigure financial systems around the world. As conversations continue about whether it will eventually become a global standard, standing alongside gold, both proponents and detractors will be watching how this story develops over the coming years. Perhaps the future of money depends on how these two assets evolve and interact in an increasingly digital economy. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Ook de Bitcoin koers heeft het nog altijd moeilijk. Wanneer zet Bitcoin zijn weg omhoog weer in en is nu Bitcoin kopen tijdens de dip een goed idee? De crypto markt is vandaag gedaald met 0,25% in market cap terwijl Bitcoin een minimale stijging doormaakt van 0,36%. Het is een teken dat vandaag opnieuw een dag van stagnatie lijkt te worden, stagnatie die heeft geleid tot een afname in trading activiteit. Het dagelijkse handelsvolume is vandaag al met 15,61% gedaald richting een waarde van $125,29 miljard. De afname in activiteit heeft er ook voor gezorgd dat de Fear & Greed Index gezakt is richting de 48. Deze waarde geeft aan dat deze index zich in neutraal terrein bevindt en investeerders een stuk terughoudender zijn in hun acties. Bitcoin koers stagneert Deze terughoudendheid is op dit moment ook terug te zien binnen de Bitcoin koers. De nummer één van de crypto markt beweegt zich namelijk al dagen zijwaarts. Met een huidige waarde van onder de $95.000 is de koers nu 3,14% minder waard dan een week geleden. Tegelijkertijd neemt het handelsvolume van Bitcoin hard af. Het huidige handelsvolume is 14,82% minder dan 24 uur geleden. Het is een duidelijk teken dat zowel de Bitcoin als de rest van de markt het moeilijk heeft. Toch betekent dit niet dat er geen ruimte is voor succes. Zo wist Bitcoin SV over de afgelopen 24 uur al 14% te pumpen. Nu Bitcoin kopen is misschien niet de juiste keuze, maar investeren in alternatieven met potentie kan mogelijk winsten met zich meebrengen. Instappen bij Bitcoin SV lijkt misschien aan de late kant nu een groot deel van de winsten al gerealiseerd zijn. Gelukkig zijn er meerdere andere veelbelovende crypto’s die veel potentieel met zich meebrengen. Hieronder gaan we verder in op de beste drie. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) – geeft kleine traders een kans De kleine trader heeft het tegenwoordig vaak moeilijk binnen de crypto markt. Nu er steeds meer grote whales zijn is het realiseren van winsten lastig. Toch lijkt er door de Wall Street Pepe nu hoop te zijn voor deze particulieren. Wall Street Pepe is namelijk een nieuw project dat alles op alles zet om deze traders een eerlijke kans te geven. Wall Street Pepe kan gezien worden als een combinatie van de hilarische Pepe coin en de trading strategieën van Wolf of Wall Street.

However, the past week’s action has been a brutal opposite of the one preceding it, with the Cardano price declining recently by as much as it gained in the previous week. However, the cryptocurrency seems to be recovering nicely, with the ADA price now stabilizing above the $0.9 mark. The question, though, is — how soon could the Cardano price return above the psychological $1 level? Here’s How ADA Price Could Reclaim $1 Ali Martinez, a top crypto analyst on the social media platform X, has shared an exciting analysis of the price of Cardano in the short term. According to the popular pundit, the altcoin’s value could return to above the $1 mark over the next few days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible The rationale behind this bullish projection is the formation of a bull pennant pattern on the one-hour price chart. A bull pennant is a pattern used in technical analysis marked by a price jump (the flagpole) before a consolidation range with converging trend lines (the pennant), which is followed by a price breakout in the same direction as the initial flagpole. Typically, the bull pennant pattern serves as a continuation indicator, signaling the persistence of a price trend (usually the upward trend). The price target from the chart formation is derived by measuring and replicating the length of the initial flagpole at the end of the end of the consolidation range. As shown in the chart above, if the price of ADA successfully breaks out of the bull pennant formation, the altcoin could visit above the $1 mark again. This represents an impressive 10% surge from the current price point. Crossing above the $1 mark again might be the spark that the Cardano token needs to conjure a rally that would see it return to its all-time high price. As revealed in a recent article, recent historical patterns point to a potential rally to a new record-high price for the altcoin. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ADA stands at around $0.9266, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past day. However, this positive single-day performance did little to relieve the bleeding the altcoin has suffered in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Cardano price is down by over 15% in the last seven days. Related Reading: SUI Defies Odds With A Sharp Rebound Above $4.9: New Highs Loom?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000",2025-01-11 14:00:28+00:00,"Bitcoin has extended its correction below the $100,000 psychological level into the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is struggling to hold above the $94,000 mark after recovering briefly from its recent crash to $91,000.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? As it stands, Bitcoin’s price outlook has taken a cautious turn, with crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighting a $12,000 void between $87,000 and $75,000. The analysis, which is based on the Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) ATH-Partitioned, reveals a lack of significant support in this range and raises concerns over a quick crash towards $75,000. $12,000 Void Shows Lack Of Support Between $87,000 And $75,000 Data from Bitcoin’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) ATH-Partitioned metric shows that the range between $87,000 and $75,000 lacks substantial realized price activity. The UTXO is a relatively quiet but important technical indicator that provides insights into the distribution of Bitcoin across different price levels and focuses on UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). Therefore, analyzing UTXOs helps identify the price levels at which Bitcoin holders are currently sitting on realized gains or losses. As noted by Ali Martinez, the range between $87,000 and $75,000 opens up a $12,000 gap that could easily become negative for Bitcoin. This is because this range represents “little to no support,” meaning there is insufficient historical buying activity to stabilize Bitcoin’s price if it enters this zone. As such, this void increases the risk of a sharp correction should Bitcoin fall below the upper boundary. Market Implications Of The $12,000 Void As it stands, the $12,000 void threat can be only valid if Bitcoin were to break below $87,000. Although Bitcoin has largely held up above $90,000 even during corrections since November, the recent drop to $91,000 opens up the possibility of an eventual drop below $90,000. This concern is amplified by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index shifting to a neutral zone, accompanied by a surge in bearish sentiment across social media. If Bitcoin were to break below $90,000, this could open up the possibility of a continued decline towards $87,000. This, in turn, would most likely lead to a swift drop to $75,000. This scenario would undoubtedly test the bullish sentiment from investors and Bitcoin’s ability to sustain predictions of a long-term bullish trajectory.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $95k: Analyst Says It’s a Golden Time to Accumulate—Here’s Why On the other hand, you could easily argue that the ongoing consolidation opens up the opportunity to accumulate more BTC. According to an analyst on CryptoQuant, the short-term SOPR indicator is currently below 1, meaning many short-term investors are selling Bitcoin at a loss. However, history shows this phenomenon often precedes a major upward trend, making it a good time for accumulation. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,350.

Reddit,solana,"I Have Been Seeing Posts on Sniping, and to Be Absolutely Frank, It Is Nothing but Damaging",2025-01-11 16:11:19,"For some time now, I’ve had an idea for a multi-chain meme project - starting on Solana and bridging to Ethereum - with the sole purpose of building something cool.

Fast forward to our launch date: everything was ready - the website, the X account, the Telegram group, visuals, tweets, and a lot of excitement. The concept revolved around a character waking up on Solana as an SPL token, realizing it had switched networks, and having one goal: to return and reunite with his beloved son on Ethereum. But enough about the meme lore.

On December 31, 2024, we launched. The chart looked healthy, with organic growth for some time. However, having all our socials and the website connected to the launch made us a target for malicious actors eager to piggyback on our hard work.

Before we knew it, we bonded and reached a market cap of nearly $200k. Unfortunately, a sniper managed to purchase 46% of the supply. It’s likely they hyped the project further through their own channels (speculating) before dumping their entire position and crashing the chart.

[Case study of a sniper attack ($ABU Moonshot launch on 12/31/24) : r/memecoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1hya1q9/case_study_of_a_sniper_attack_abu_moonshot_launch/)

This is a malicious, predatory act that cripples promising projects, drives investor losses, and perpetuates the narrative that crypto projects are just ""rug pulls."" In reality, many good projects fall victim to external forces beyond their control - actors like this sniper who exploit them for personal gain.

Thankfully, a dedicated community member dug deeper and created a detailed case study of the sniper attack, linked above, helping to shed light on what really happened.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,solana,BullX fee: how to calculate all fees,2025-01-11 17:01:59,"I have this wallet address I used to test trade: HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w

The fees essentially ate all the profits. Even though eventually I set the buy priority fee to something small like 0.0001 and turned off MEV protection, gigantic fees still were charged.

For instance, I bought 5EYsHuyYGriuoYah7e9FfbSYuGW3vJevHnm2mtnJPfto (15M) and paid these fees:

Create account: -0.02203928 ($4)
Create account: -0.00203928 ($0.4)
Paying the token price to get token from Raydium pool: -0.02 ($3)
Then the token 15M is deposited to token account, and I get 
Close account: +0.00203928 transaction.

I assume this account 
https://solscan.io/account/5QiMQo2nQwkcvj2QcZJVpFSGBgGnXhrgL3vedsVuB6PM#transfers
is being created and closed (within a single Buy transaction).
What I also don't understand, why the Transfers in this account have (+0.02203928) and (-0.00203928), but the balance is zero? Shouldn't 0.02 be left?

Then I pay another fee -0.0002 ($0.03) and another -0.002 ($0.39)

I realize that 0.00203928 is the fixed Solana fee for opening a token account (https://solscan.io/account/2fKFFfY9BYBECReK2PNgqe6UhxHhrTg7x9jYjGvWrh1H), but I have two Create account transactions, I assume one of them (the one with -0.02203928 fee) is made by BullX?


These are all transactions, from the first Buy to the last Sell of the token:

https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736344500000&time=1736345300000#transfers

For selling I only paid -0.00203928 to Create account, and -0.000261668 transfer fee, and -0.001 Jit fee (maybe didn't have MEV turned off for selling?)

Another example, buying and selling MLG Doge token: https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736286500000&time=1736286690000#transfers

To Buy I paid -0.02203928, -0.00203928 to create account. -0.0002 and -0.002 transfer fees. Essentially around $5 in fees just to Buy. For selling it's -0.00203928 create account fee, -0.000248179, -0.002, -0.0001 transfer fees.

Looks like the initial 0.022 accounts for the majority of the fees, what is that thing?

At the same time, when I first buy Emma token (BznQ5VeNfJVY94KdMByFPNH7Ri9qTLWCHMLfcd6Rpump, transactions: https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736350580000&time=1736639999000#transfers), I only pay -0.00203928 fee to create account (a single create account transaction). Before, when I was selling tokens, I would get - token and + WSOL, but with Emma, I only have -193,848.691919 token transaction and now +WSOL following it, like usual. I go on to buy more of it +225,960.354818 and sell later -225,960.354818, but no +WSOL transactions at all.

Could someone help me make sense of BullX fees and what's going on with these examples?",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

First of all I‘m honest and also benefit from this but you guys need to understand how fucked up this space is and why so many loose not less than everything.

Despite all the rugpullers or SOL influencers who are dumping on you, I lately had some personal contact to one of the biggest what you would call „insider“ sheme. The numbers are shocking and while most traders know aboit them I still think it‘s important to talk about this.

So these guys are working with 50+ devs who all know how to market a coin. They change their wallets for copytraders and just so nobody knows this project will be successful.
After the launch these guys gets onboard to give them a huge launch volume which usually leads the coins to some front pages.
Depending on the coin and market they cash out at 10-100x on every single on of them and then change wallets again.

This sheme just gets crazier everyday because they get more money to advertise all of these and are dumping on the whole community",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,solana,Educational Blog Post | Solana Token Accounts Made Simple: Why Should You Close Them? (Written by RayBot intern),2025-01-09 20:06:53,"**Source:** [https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9](https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9)

On Solana, associated token accounts (ATAs) are essential for managing tokens. But what happens when you no longer need a specific token account? That’s where the “close token account” transaction comes in. Let’s explore why and how you might close an ATA, and the benefits of doing so.

[https:\/\/t.me\/ray\_magenta\_bot](https://preview.redd.it/mrlvvwoqy0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8063f79b43829bc5d71e8607c2639023379f0acb)

# What Does It Mean to Close an Associated Token Account?

Closing an associated token account is like cleaning out a locker at the end of the school year. Once you’re done using it — say, you’ve sold all the tokens — you can “close” the account. This deletes the account and refunds the rent (SOL) used to maintain it.

>

# Why Close an ATA?

There are a few key reasons you might want to close an associated token account:

1. **You No Longer Need It:** If you’ve sol all the tokens and don’t plan to use that token again, closing the account cleans up your wallet.
2. **Save on Rent Costs: Each account you maintain uses a bit of SOL. By closing unused accounts, you can reclaim those funds.**

# How to Close an ATA

There are many tools that can help you close ATA accounts. Here’s how it works:

1. **Ensure the Account Is Empty:** Before closing an account, make sure it has a balance of 0. You can do this by transferring or selling any remaining tokens to another wallet or account.
2. **Use a Cleanup Tool:** Use one of the well-established tools to close your accounts. For instance, go to [Sol Incinerator](https://sol-incinerator.com/#/) (one of the most popular tools for wallet cleanups) and select “CLEANUP.” It will display all your vacant accounts. There are other tools offering the same functionality — do your own research (DYOR).

The “close token account” transaction is a simple yet powerful tool for optimizing your wallet on Solana. By closing unused accounts, you save money, keep your wallet organized, and contribute to the overall health of the network. Whether you’re a casual user or a developer, understanding and utilizing this feature can make a big difference in your Solana experience.

So next time you spot an empty token account in your wallet, consider closing it — your SOL balance will thank you!

We launched [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) in early 2024 with the goal of empowering developers to compete, experiment, and build products across a broad spectrum of crypto use cases through our online hackathons. In partnership with the Solana Foundation and numerous ecosystem organizations, we’ve built the largest hackathons in crypto and helped accelerate the rapid growth of Solana’s startup ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/f6354joq01ce1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf37ffc7659f232fb0275d195c444222b7040756

Following each major Solana hackathon ([Renaissance](https://www.colosseum.org/renaissance?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Radar](https://www.colosseum.org/radar?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), we accepted two accelerator batches each with 10+ winning teams. And to date, we’ve made pre-seed investments in 20+ startups. Reviewing thousands of hackathon submissions and working with talented founders in our accelerator program has given us an up close view of crypto's rapidly emerging markets. As the year comes to a close, we’re excited to share our perspective on 12 high-growth verticals where we saw exciting development in 2024, and that we believe will continue to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. In addition, we highlight the hackathon winners and teams we’ve backed who we believe are creating the markets that will drive each category forward.

*Note: Many of the projects mentioned below are currently on devnet, with mainnet deployments expected in Q1 and Q2 2025.*

**Non-Sovereign SoV Assets**

Over the past decade, Bitcoin has proven that a non-sovereign store-of-value (SoV) asset can gain global acceptance and secure a core position within the global financial system. While Bitcoin’s incredible success validated the concept, we believe it also opened the door for additional digital gold-like assets to reach escape velocity and meaningful liquidity in the coming years.

[Ore](https://x.com/OREsupply?ref=blog.colosseum.org) stands out as the most promising non-sovereign asset tailored specifically for onchain ecosystems. Strong community support, thoughtful economic design, and increased liquidity—fueled by “Boosts” on key trading pairs—[positioned Ore well in 2024](https://x.com/mattytay/status/1870887900663169059?ref=blog.colosseum.org). We’re excited to see the core team use these structural advantages to build new products that further its adoption in the broader onchain economy.

**Futarchy**

DAOs have long struggled with governance, often relying on 1-token-1-vote structures that can stifle progress, resulting in a waste of both human and treasury capital. MetaDAO offers a transformative “[futarchy as a service](https://metadao.fi/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)” framework, enabling organizations to make decisions through markets rather than traditional voting mechanisms.

[MetaDAO](https://x.com/MetaDAOProject?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is already integrated into leading projects like Drift and Jito. We believe futarchy will continue to solidify itself as the default governance module in the Solana ecosystem (and crypto more broadly) in 2025—one that overcomes entrenched governance challenges and accelerates dynamic decision-making.

**Decentralized Stablecoins**

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT have achieved widespread adoption, and crypto-native products such as Ethena are also on the rise. However, existing stablecoin implementations often sacrifice censorship resistance, capital efficiency, or both.

A new wave of experimentation is underway, with the aim of creating stablecoins that offer robust stability while also delivering more decentralization, transparency, and higher yield potential. [Reflect](https://x.com/ReflectCX?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Hylo](https://x.com/hylo_so?ref=blog.colosseum.org) represent two of the most promising protocols leading the decentralized stablecoin renaissance in 2025.

**Crypto’s Growth Stack**

As consumer-facing products begin to dominate venture funding in the Solana ecosystem, the need for sophisticated growth tools will increase in lockstep. Just as Web2 startups have grown up around powerful analytics and marketing tools, Web3 builders are now developing their own data-driven growth engines to meet their unique needs.

[Torque](https://x.com/torqueprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is one such product, providing a powerful onchain-native growth platform, enabling just-in-time user rewards based on a wide variety of behaviors. Prominent teams like Tensor and Metaplex already use Torque for targeted growth campaigns. Meanwhile [AdX](https://x.com/AdXso_?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team in our latest accelerator cohort, is building a decentralized ad exchange, granting both Web 2 and Web 3 projects direct access to effective distribution channels.

**High-performance Clients**

Currently, Solana’s network relies on two main node clients: Anza’s Agave and Jump’s Firedancer, the latter of which hasn’t been fully deployed yet. The Firedancer team has taken on the ambitious (and critical) effort of building a new client from the ground up, with a focus on high-performance. While we believe this will be a successful effort over the coming years, we also believe there are sustainable opportunities for monetizing more tightly-scoped validator improvements even sooner. 

[Rakurai](https://x.com/Rakurai_io?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team of experienced engineers from Apple and high-frequency trading, are capitalizing on one such opportunity. Building on upcoming Agave releases, their validator client will integrate an optimized transaction scheduler that has benchmarked at up to 5x the current block rewards and yield boosts of over 30% compared to existing clients. We anticipate a continued increase in competition amongst validator operators, leading to better network performance for apps and users in the years to come.

**Crypto Developer Tooling**

As crypto matures, development teams require increasingly advanced tooling to secure, monitor, and scale their products. In traditional tech, tools like HashiCorp’s Terraform made cloud infrastructure management far simpler and more reliable for engineers. In crypto, [Txtx](https://x.com/txtxrun?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is poised to offer similarly transformative infrastructure—improving security, reliability, and reproducibility of workflows involving onchain programs/smart contracts.

For monitoring and rapid bug resolution, [Tokamai](https://x.com/gotokamai?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has also emerged as a crypto-native equivalent to Sentry, empowering developers to maintain application reliability through every layer of the stack.

**Onchain Yield**

While DeFi has introduced overcollateralized lending, capital-efficient yield remains elusive. The next phase of DeFi will bring more sophisticated yield markets onchain, enabled through true prime brokerage-like functionality and liquid staking fundamentals.

[Asgard](https://x.com/asgardfi?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is laying this groundwork by building a suite of DeFi protocols, including a spot margin aggregator and credit synthesizer. [Pye](https://x.com/pyefinance?ref=blog.colosseum.org), another hackathon winner, is creating a marketplace that allows stakers to tokenize and forward-sell their staking yield—further extending the frontier of DeFi 2.0.

The final team we backed in this vertical is [Watt](https://x.com/wattprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is building a volatility farming protocol utilizing market arbitrage to generate real yield for users and foster liquidity for the ecosystem as a whole.

**Private DeFi Infrastructure**

Transparency is a defining feature of DeFi, yet certain market participants prefer selective privacy. PayPal’s integration of confidential transactions using token extensions for its PYUSD stablecoin highlights a growing demand for privacy-enhanced financial infrastructure.

We believe this foreshadows in a new era of embedded privacy primitives for DeFi. [Darklake](https://x.com/darklakefi?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a recent hackathon standout, employs zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy-first dark pool trading platform.

**Sports Markets**

Sports are rapidly financializing: stadiums are integrating casinos, online betting is thriving, and college athletes are now receiving substantial compensation. Crypto is poised to expand and democratize these markets—enabling direct ownership, unique betting models, and new forms of engagement.

In our newest accelerator cohort, [AlphaFC](https://x.com/alphafcxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is pioneering the tokenization of sports fandom through real ownership of an English football club, and [Pregame](https://x.com/pregame_hq?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is building a new platform for direct p2p sports betting. We're excited to watch both of these endeavors expand crypto’s role in the sports economy.

**Virtual Infrastructure Networks**

DeVINs (Decentralized Virtual Infrastructure Networks) gained momentum in 2024 and we continue to see top founder talent launch a diversity of products in the space.

[BlockMesh](https://x.com/blockmesh_xyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) empowers users to earn passive income by leveraging their unused bandwidth, and is well on their way to building a strong network with over 500,000 extension downloads.  Meanwhile, [MeshMap](https://x.com/meshmapxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is focused on building a 3D AR mapping network. Although mainstream AR/VR adoption is still in its infancy, we anticipate accelerated growth in these areas over the next 1-2 years. Finally, we also backed [DBunker](https://x.com/Dbunker_Network?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is an aggregator and marketplace giving users the ability to participate across many DeVINs.

**Energy Markets**

Rising global energy demand and increasing climate pressures create volatility and opportunity. Southeast Asia, in particular, has seen high demand for innovative solutions to support a growing population with an aging energy grid. We’ve backed 2 India-based teams who are building novel token-incentivized infrastructure to serve this demand.

[DeCharge](https://x.com/DeCharge__?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has deployed over 150 EV charging stations within just a few months, and is expanding to the U.S. in Q1 2025, and [GreenkWh](https://x.com/GreenKWh?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is using battery packs to coordinate off-grid energy—both projects exemplify how crypto can reshape global energy infrastructure.

**Social Markets**

After a 2024 boom in memecoins, founders are now exploring deeper integrations of social media, token issuance, and gaming. The following teams are exploring use cases across a spectrum of community engagement to gamified token economies:

* [Banger](https://x.com/bangerdotlol?ref=blog.colosseum.org): An app that enables users to buy and sell “tweet tokens,” Curators to profit from high-volume tweet markets, and Creators to earn for their viral posts.
* [Peek](https://x.com/peekdotcyou?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A platform that leverages liquid crypto markets to gamify TikTok videos and content.
* [Supersize](https://x.com/supersizegg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A Mini-clip style gaming platform building an onchain PVP game where token communities wager and compete for dominance to become the largest “blob” on the map.
* [Monsters](https://x.com/monsdotgg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A new game for memecoin communities, blending Pokémon-inspired mechanics with high-stakes betting.
* [Teamplay](https://x.com/teamplay_games?ref=blog.colosseum.org) (with Midcurve): A platform for creators to host private gaming sessions and contests, tightening community engagement and opening new revenue streams through a token-enhancing toolkit.

**Looking Ahead**

As we prepare to run more hackathons for the Solana ecosystem in 2025, we’re eager to learn from the next generation of founders and support the creation of novel crypto markets. One emerging force we’re closely examining is AI weaving its way into crypto landscape. While we don’t view AI as a standalone use case, we do see it as a transformative layer that will enhance all verticals.

# 🚀 Investments and Themes for 2025

Colosseum launched in early 2024 to help developers compete and experiment across a wide spectrum of Solana-based products through online hackathons. 

Since then, the team has reviewed thousands of submissions, accepted multiple cohorts into its accelerator, and made pre-seed investments in more than 20 promising startups. 

Drawing on that hands-on experience, Colosseum has identified 12 high-growth verticals that are set to shape the Solana and broader crypto landscape in 2025, each one addressing real-world challenges.

A key theme running through all twelve verticals is a renewed focus on real-world utility and sophisticated market design. 

Whether it’s a sports fan token that unlocks new ways to engage with your favorite team, or a next-gen aggregator that forward-sells staked yield, these protocols aim to bring deep liquidity, better user experiences, and new revenue streams on-chain. 

And while Colosseum doesn’t see AI as its own siloed vertical, the team expects AI to become an indispensable layer across each of these categories by streamlining data insights, risk management, and user onboarding in ways we haven’t even imagined yet.

For developers and builders looking to stay ahead, these areas offer opportunities to create new markets and leverage existing ones. Expect these verticals to play an outsized role as we move into 2025 and beyond.

# ➰ Accounts Lattice Hash

Solana developers have introduced a proposal to tackle the [state growth problem](https://x.com/aeyakovenko/status/1789009684378382404?ref=blog.colosseum.org) by implementing a lattice-based system known as the Accounts Lattice Hash. 

According to the proposal ([SIMD-215](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0215-accounts-lattice-hash.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), ""the main goal is to scale Solana to billions of accounts and compute a ‘hash of all accounts’ in practical time and space.” 

One of the core changes involves homomorphic hashing, a method that verifies only the accounts that have changed, rather than reprocessing every account on the network. 

>Think of it like cleaning a house. Instead of scrubbing every single room every day, you only tidy up the spaces that got messy.  
\~ Republik Labs

At the end of each epoch, Solana’s Epoch Accounts Hash mechanism must rehash all accounts. As the size of Solana state grows, this process becomes increasingly resource-intensive.

In contrast, the lattice-based method accumulates individual account hashes directly and updates only the accounts that have changed. 

By eliminating the need for full recalculations, the approach will reduce computational overhead. This upgrade also aims to preserve the network’s existing security level, offering a path to global scale without sacrificing safety.

If the community approves this improvement, Solana’s infrastructure could set a new benchmark for blockchain scalability.

[**New Solana proposal aims to fix scalability issues with ‘lattice’ system**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-solana-proposal-fix-scalability-issues-lattice-hashing-system?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🛡️ Quantum Resistant Winternitz Vault

Google’s quantum computing project [Willow](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) made headlines recently and raised concerns in the crypto world. 

Blockchains use cryptographic systems built on mathematical problems that quantum computers could solve much faster, ultimately making it possible to reverse-engineer private keys from public keys.

While we're still a long way off from that ever happening, Solana developer Dean Little has introduced the Solana Winternitz Vault, an optional quantum-resistant vault that leverages hash-based signature technology.

The Solana Winternitz Vault is essentially a specialized account system that uses hash-based signatures instead of traditional elliptic curve cryptography. 

The idea is simple: Each time a user makes a transaction, a new private key is generated and revealed, minimizing the chance of a quantum computer exploiting previously exposed public keys. 

Under the hood, it leverages Winternitz One-Time Signatures (W-OTS) along with a Merkle root structure for added security and tamper-proof verification.

While the vault is an entirely optional feature, its hash-based signature approach shows an awareness of quantum threats and a commitment to protecting user funds as quantum computing continues to advance.

[**Solana can be quantum-resistant today, here’s how**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solana-can-be-quantum-resistant-today-heres-how-614544fbccd8?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🗳️ Solana Founder Survey

Lightspeed polled 42 anonymous Solana founders on a variety of topics in the Solana space. 

Many founders remain bullish on Solana’s trajectory and culture, even saying if Solana didn’t exist, they wouldn’t be in crypto at all. 

However, among those open to other ecosystems, Base and Sui ranked as the most appealing. 

Founders also shared concerns about MEV on Solana, noting it drives up costs and makes transaction ordering more complex.

Memecoins got a “mostly good” label from respondents where AI agents were called “overrated” and seen by some as mostly hype. 

On the infrastructure side, founders said the demand for blockspace is growing fast, and they want bigger blocks to keep fees manageable.

Overall, founder sentiment highlights excitement about the future of Solana, a desire to fend off rising MEV concerns, and a readiness to innovate with new use cases.

Reddit,solana,On how to build a wallet watcher,2025-01-09 02:43:42,"Every game in the world is won by knowing something the other players don’t. Crypto is no different. With the blockchain being public your job is to either be the winner with your own ideas or find the sharp plays made by the sharp accounts. Finding sharp accounts is still on you. But I’m here to share some insight into how to monitor these accounts with automation.

I’ve done a few YouTube videos sharing what I’ve learned about monitoring Solana transactions and I’ve done one about this topic. But with this subreddit’s understandable change to move away from links and self promotion I’ll be sharing this information in text format. 

This is just one way, but I think this is the fastest way to spin up a wallet watcher. The premise is that we can leverage a service provided by a company called Helius to monitor the transactions and alert an application we spin up with new updates from a wallet or account. Helius is one of the most reputable services to interact easily with Solana. Their free tier is generous and they offer a service that utilizes Webhooks, meaning that when Helius detects an account made a transaction, it will alert our application. Our application has to be hosted to receive webhooks. For my own use I am using Cloudflare Workers. It also has a generous free tier. But you can find hundreds of options for this part. 

I kept my tracker simple, when Cloudflare/the app receives the webhooks, it parses out the transaction and I have mine alert me via Telegram. 

That’s pretty much it. Helius to a quick Cloudflare Worker to Telegram. All you need to get started. I’ll try and update the post with the code later without a link for safety. But if you have any questions, my DMs are open. Best wishes ",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,solana,"Are meme coins quite literally only a giant pyramid scheme, please explain if not
",2025-01-08 16:11:37,"Edit: perhaps not a ‘pyramid scheme’ but rather MLM marketing 

I was initially thinking meme coins have value to them defined by the strength of the community and what we see today is a decentralization of marketing — if that makes sense.

For example, useless companies/brands are being sold for millions only due to the large audience it has accumulated. Now only a few at the top profit and everyone else gives all their money to them.

With meme coins (ideally speaking) everyone gets a stake of the profit sharing. No one cares about celebrities anymore — so whatever money they could have extracted from us we decided to just form our own community with it and we all have a chance of building together. Also, memes can be viewed as leverage to buy btc (which also implies the coin will have a short lifespan from an individual 'investor')

Of course, I’m leaving out the rug pulling as I’m talking of the what meme coins are supposed to be imo and not what inevitably happens to 99% of coins. But to answer the rug pulling, this is a byproduct of minimal regulations. As the sector grows and some regulation takes place, meme money will converge to the best memes that have proven its proof of concept.

Cool. But here’s where I’m at right now:

1. Memes have almost no intrinsic value
2. People buy a meme for its growth
3. Memes are not a store of value
4. Memes run on another crypto’s blockchain

These equate to the same very thick ceiling for all memes. Once a meme hits a certain MC, it’s basically a wrap for the meme. People don’t see it having quick growth anymore, it’s not a store of value, what if it grew so much you need to spend 1 SOL just to get a fraction of a meme, hey it’s dipping and there actually is not intrinsic value to any of this —> dump

So far, going long on any memecoin after initial hype almost always results in failure. Long as in 5yrs+. Doge is doing ight (although I’m sure most got burned) but only because of Elon.

So, given the above how can meme coins not be a giant pyramid scheme? I’m not even talking about rug pulling here. After an its growth, you have to cash out because memes don’t store value. They only Caveat I see is no one knows when it stops growing — but at the moment mc is a huge indicator.

My only optimistic conclusion so far is Solana just has to explode to increase the ceiling of these coins, and there needs to be a huge barrier for minting new memes thus other coins will have long term value. And I think memes are going to be around because gambling hasn’t gone anywhere.

My question is though, is a ‘strong community’ actually enough to support a meme coin, long term? People want to buy a meme, forget about it, come back 5yrs later and still be up.

* UK-based fintech firm Revolut became the first banking data publisher to join the multi-chain Pyth Network.
* Revolut will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth price feeds, allowing DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

Crypto-friendly fintech firm Revolut has become the first banking data publisher to join the Pyth Network.

 — a provider of real-time market data for onchain applications.

Revolut, which boasts over 45 million users across 200 countries, will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth’s price feeds, enabling DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

“Our partnership with Pyth is an important milestone in Revolut's journey to modernize finance,” Revolut Global Business Head of Crypto Mazen Eljundi said. “By working with Pyth to provide our reliable market data to applications, Revolut can influence digital economies by ensuring developers and users have access to the precise, real-time information they need.”

As a Pyth oracle network publisher, the digital banking platform will help secure the operations of hundreds of dapps, which can now access over 500 real-time feeds for digital and traditional assets, responsible for more than $1 trillion in total traded volume during 2024, according to a statement shared with The Block.

Other Pyth data publishers include Amber Group, Binance, Bitstamp, Bybit, Cboe, Cumberland DRW, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, Jane Street, OKX, Raydium and Wintermute.

“Pyth’s collaboration with Revolut is part of a larger trend we’re seeing, where traditional banking institutions, trusted by millions of customers globally, are recognizing the value of decentralized finance and digital assets,” Michael Cahill, CEO and co-founder of Douro Labs, core contributor to the Pyth Network, said. “Together, we are driving the future of finance, where transparent and reliable data empowers the next generation of financial applications.”

Originally designed for the Solana blockchain, Pyth Network now operates across more than 80 blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Aptos and Sui, providing real-time market data for cryptocurrencies, equities, FX and commodities.

# Revolut’s expanding crypto initiatives

In May 2024, the fintech firm launched a standalone crypto trading platform, Revolut X, in the UK, subsequently [expanding](https://www.theblock.co/post/326175/revolut-expands-crypto-exchange-30-markets) to 30 European countries in November. In September, Revolut was also [reported to be](https://www.theblock.co/post/317166/uk-fintech-firm-revolut-intends-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin-report) in the process of launching its own stablecoin.

Revolut [secured](https://www.theblock.co/post/307389/crypto-friendly-fintech-revolut-secures-banking-license-from-uk-financial-regulator) a banking license from the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority in July 2024, after a three-year application process. Obtaining a UK banking license is notoriously difficult due to the stringent regulatory and compliance requirements imposed by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority.

For several decades, the UK banking sector was dominated by large, established institutions, and no new banking licenses were granted until Metro Bank in 2010. The Bank of Dave campaign following the 2008 financial crisis highlighted the challenges of entering the sector, and subsequent reforms helped pave the way for several other new banks, including Monzo and Starling, which disrupted the market.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

The bill ended up being almost $300 and my work always slows down to a crawl in the beginning months of the year so I had to use whatever I had in my solana chain which was around $200 to help cover the cost. I'm happy I was able to get my dog the help he needed but I'm also devastated that my crypto is gone.

Reddit,solana,Solana team or insider setting up trade bots raking in millions if not billions,2025-01-08 00:29:53,I’ve come to the conclusion that solana chain company or an insider has thousands of MEV trade bots scamming people out of millions if not billions. There are so many of these bots constantly trading making millions of profit within a month and they move faster than any other bot program you can think of.. meaning they have direct access to the data hub/ nodes as possible. I may have to hang my hat on this memecoin trend.. haven’t fully decided. Not as bullish as I once was. This will all come crashing down at some point.,2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010
Reddit,solana,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-07 13:22:55,"Hey fam, happy new year. This was popular on r/Solidity, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT:*** *The deadline to apply was just extended from to January 11th!*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

LMK if you have any questions, the team or I can try to give more info.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,solana,Re: looking for assistance coding flash loan arbitrage bot,2025-01-08 06:50:51,"Posted last week and got scammed. Looking for a couple of people to join a team to test and develop a flash loan arbitrage bot for sol and SPL tokens on raydium orca serum and jupyter. I understand arbitrage but need some assistance with the more technical aspects of coding the bot. Looking forward to learning a lot on my own and contributing what I can to the project. All code will be shared in a private github repo so that the developers can use it on their own machines or servers once it is working and tested. No telegram. I will host a discord server or something else that cannot be taken down. Everyone can fork the repo as long as it remains private and all forks are private when we are finished. No one will be asked to contribute money at any time. Everyone will work on either planning, logic, coding, or optimization. Your payment is the finished project which only the small dev team will have access to. My knowledge is limited so don't be intimidated, just ready to learn and contribute what you can. There are no time constraints. It will be done when it is as profitable as we can practically make it. Again, no money or crypto will be exchanged between any members of the dev team. Wsl, debian based hyperv or other vm, or bare metal Linux will be required. Knowledge on Linux is not required as it is easy to learn for what we are trying to do. No scammers allowed. Got burned and not letting it happen again. Leave helpful comments with suggestions for finding a team or if you are interested in joining the team. Let's try to make some passive income and learn a little along the way. ",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,solana,Solana's SIMD-215 Proposal: A Major Step Toward Blockchain Scalability and Quantum Resistance,2025-01-07 16:19:23,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my thoughts on an exciting development I came across in the blockchain space: Solana's SIMD-215 proposal. This update aims to solve some of the most significant challenges in blockchain scalability.

At its core, SIMD-215 introduces Solana's Accounts Lattice Hash system, which addresses inefficient account state updates. By using homomorphic hashing, the network only updates what’s changed, instead of recalculating the entire state from scratch. This approach allows for:

Improved efficiency 👍

The ability to support billions of accounts 😳

Enhanced security, with 128-bit encryption and quantum resistance

What stands out to me is not only how Solana is solving current scalability issues, but also how it's preparing for future threats, like quantum computing. This could be a game-changer in making blockchain networks more secure and scalable for widespread adoption.

What do you all think about this approach? Do you believe scalability is the key to blockchain reaching mainstream adoption, or are there other factors at play?

Reddit,ethereum,noob question about ethereum & coinbase,2025-01-11 22:01:18,"TL;DR: This stuff is confusing and I'm about to waste your time.

Let me tell you a tale of my ethereum adventure...

I saw something I could buy with ETH and figured hey, great time to finally get my feet wet with crypto -- as much for the learning as the end result. So I set up a coinbase account, connected my debit card, and bought $100 of ETH. Then coinbase was like ""you can now spin the wheel for a free gift!"" so I click the button and it says ""you are not allowed to spin the wheel"" or some shit. Which leads me to find a bunch of reddit threads of people enraged at coinbase for poor service and support. Okay, well that's a good excuse to learn how to set up my own wallet. Not ready to get into hardware just yet, so I install metamask and create a wallet.

I go to coinbase to send my ETH to my wallet and it warns me to make sure that my wallet supports the same network, and I see coinbase uses the Base network, so (first mistake in 3... 2... 1...) I switch metamask to the Base network and do the transfer. In retrospect I think I could and should have switched coinbase to use Ethereum network instead. Didn't realize it stays tied to that network, though I get that now.

But anyway, now I go to the site with the thing I wanted to buy and it says I have to use the Ethereum network. Ugh so I gotta move it over. So I go to metamask and do a ""bridge"" to move my ETH from Base to Ethereum. But it fails... I think because metamask wants to take a service fee and it can only take it from Ethereum network (??) So.. I can't move my ETH to Ethereum because I don't have any ETH in Ethereum!

Okay, back to coinbase to buy another $10 of ETH to put on Ethereum network for the fee. But I already spent the $100 debit limit, so I add a paypal account and buy $10 of ETH, which turns out to be $9.75 cause this time they charge me a quarter for some reason.

Now to transfer my new ETH to my wallet on Ethereum network. BZZZT NOPE. Funds are ""Unavailable"" for 10 DAYS because clearing/security/blah/blah. Since when it does take 10 days to clear a $10 paypal transfer WTAF.

So now what? Looks like I could add my bank account directly for another funding source, but my appetite for connecting things to coinbase is waning rapidly. I could look into another exchange.. Binance? Kraken? But are they really any better?

If you've actually read this far, I'm interested in any thoughts. Does coinbase just suck or is this par for the course? Is there a different way for me to move my ETH from Base to Ethereum that doesn't require already having ETH in Ethereum?

Thanks!",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010
Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Developers: Help Build a Proof of Existence DApp & Blockchain,2025-01-11 21:50:22,"Hey fellow developers!

I'm embarking on a project to build a decentralized application (dApp) focused on **Proof of Existence**. This dApp will allow users to securely and immutably record the existence of digital or physical assets on a blockchain.

**Key Features:**

* **Secure Hashing:** Implement robust hashing algorithms (like SHA-256) to create unique fingerprints of user files.
* **Blockchain Integration:** Integrate with a suitable blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana) to store these hashes securely and transparently.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to upload files, generate hashes, and record them on the blockchain.
* **Timestamping:** Incorporate timestamping mechanisms to provide verifiable evidence of when the file existed.
* **Data Privacy:** Explore privacy-enhancing techniques (like zero-knowledge proofs) to protect user data while maintaining the integrity of the proof.

**Tech Stack (Open to Suggestions):**

* **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, or similar
* **Backend:** Node.js, Python (with frameworks like Flask or Django)
* **Blockchain:** Ethereum (with Solidity), Polygon, Solana
* **Smart Contracts:** Develop smart contracts to handle hash storage, timestamping, and potentially access control.

**I'm looking for developers who are passionate about:**

* Blockchain technology and decentralized applications
* Secure coding practices and cryptography
* User experience and interface design

**If you're interested in contributing to this project, please reach out!** I'm open to collaboration, code reviews, and any other forms of assistance.

**Let's build a secure and transparent Proof of Existence solution together!**",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

My question may be duplicate but I don't have much time, I literally googled single time and there was not good answers so I decided to ask directly without any deep searchs so sorry for that.

last 3 month I got interested in blockchain technology and started learning. It was very interesting to learn architectural design behind some of them. ( I touched mostly bitcoin, ether and solana).  
At this moment I want to dive deeper in etherium so I need some guidence and advice where to start learning all the development concepts around it.

Reddit,ethereum,Why does the same validators gets chosen to propose blocks multiple times in a row?,2025-01-11 06:20:37,"My understanding of the validator selection process is that a validator is chosen at random through RADAO to attest and propose the block.

How does this address consistently chosen through RADAO? What am I missing something here?

The address I discovered is constantly receiving small amounts of ETH (0.0000000...) and instantly transferring them to another address. I searched for the address, and all the results pointed to crypto scams. A few people who got scammed mentioned that their funds somehow ended up at the address I found.

Reddit,ethereum,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-09 13:11:10,"Hey folks, happy new year. This was popular on r/ethdev, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT***\*: They just extended the application deadline to January 11th, so I’d apply ASAP if interested\*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

LMK if you have any questions, the team or I can try to give more info.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Anyways yhe article was from 2 years ago or so. Some big brain and was actually very cool and informative (almost certain it was published on Medium). The cover image stuck with me though

Title was something like:

Ethereum is like a space colony // defi is like a base on mars // web3 is like a space station

I tried searching a bunch of alternatives. Idea was that all these separate moving parts make up this cool ecosystem like a space colony. Maker was in it, Uniswap, other big protocols had their own little base or building and thing were connecting. I think newer protocol was landing it’s ship and plugging in

Pretty sure is was specifically about Ethereum and not all of defi/web3.. but throwing it out there it could have been. The colors of the cover were light and similar to general EF tones.

Been searching for days and can’t find, hopefully someone remembers the actual article (cause I’d like to re-read it as well as reference the cover lol)

A simple tool ([Satosh.me](http://satosh.me)) that gives you a clean profile page (satosh.me/yourname) to organize and share your Ethereum addresses professionally.

**Key Ethereum Features:**

\- Support for ETH and all ERC-20 tokens

\- Clean way to share different addresses for different tokens

\- Support for ENS domains

\- Track which addresses are being engaged with

\- Dark mode interface (because Web3)

**Why I built it:**

\- Managing multiple addresses for different tokens was getting messy

\- Needed a professional way to share addresses with clients/community

\- Wanted analytics on which addresses get used

\- Tired of copying/pasting addresses from different places

**Technical Details:**

\- No custody of private keys

\- Just manages public addresses

\- Built on Next.js/React

\- Simple dashboard for address management

Everything's free for basic use, with a Pro tier for advanced features (30-day trial available).

Live at: [satosh.me](http://satosh.me)

**I'd especially love feedback from the Ethereum community:**

1. What other Ethereum-specific features would be useful?

2. Any ENS integration ideas?

3. What kind of analytics would be most valuable?

Looking forward to your suggestions on making this more useful for the Ethereum ecosystem!",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

2 eth being sent to defi to be converted to wETH

at the token receive address, I only see 3 transactions, not including the transaction above. However, the balance is updated to show the addition of the 2 wETH. (3.357...wETH)

I would anticipate or expect to see a transaction from yesterday that says ""IN"" to the address for the amount of 2 WETH, but I don't.

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept 3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

Reddit,ethereum,"""Vitalik Buterin Deserves a Nobel Prize in Economics for His Work on Crypto and Ethereum."": Bankless Co-Founder Ryan Sean Adams",2025-01-03 14:32:32,"In a tweet Ryan Sean Adams - co-founder of Bankless - said that Vitalik Buterin should be recognized with a Nobel prize in economics for his contributions to Ethereum and the entire crypto space. He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

I wonder if one day Vitalik will be remembered as one of the greatest economic innovators of our time",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

Please ask any questions you may have!  We have our next public goods funding round beginning January 11th.  To learn more about Octant, join our discord: [https://discord.com/invite/octant](https://discord.com/invite/octant) ",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,ethereum,How to Start Research on Ethereum as a Beginner?,2025-01-01 14:03:35,"I’m a developer, just getting into this space. While I’ve worked on development, I’ve never done formal research in crypto before. I want to expand my knowledge and better understand the ecosystem from a research perspective.

Could you share some advice or resources for someone with development experience to get started with crypto research? I’m particularly interested in:

* Researching Ethereum protocols, scalability solutions, or DeFi.
* Understanding key academic or technical papers in this field.
* Tools, frameworks, or platforms commonly used in crypto research.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010
Reddit,ethereum,"Transfer went wrong, please help me",2025-01-02 10:32:35,"I did 2 money transfers from Gatehub wallet to Revolut wallet. Regarding BTC, I pushed « receive » on Revolut and it gave me a BTC wallet address, which I copy pasted after pushing « transfer BTC » on Gatehub.

I did the exact same thing for Eth.

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

I am no crypto expert, can anyone here help me  find my money ?

Ps : wrote to revolut, they said they don’t know where is the money, and that they are looking

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

Please help

EDIT : Turns out Gatehub sent BTC and ETH on XRP network which is not managed by Revolut. But they still found a way to recover the funds !! So money is safe for now 🤙🏼

Thank you to all the people who tried to help. 🙏🏻

Cheers to all the scammers who tried to make me log my wallets into your dark web apps. 🙋🏻‍♂️",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,ethereum,What's the most economic way to swap rETH(on mainnet) to USCD(on Arbitrum)?,2024-12-31 22:13:58,"Please let me know if there's a better way to maximize my funds.  I only want to be using DEX.

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Thanks for your input!

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

I’m just getting started with learning about smart contracts, and honestly, I’m pretty excited (and a little overwhelmed). Ethereum has always fascinated me, and I finally decided it’s time to stop just reading about it and actually start building something.

I’ve been messing around with Solidity and doing some tutorials to get a feel for how everything works. My goal is to eventually create my own project—something small and manageable for now, but hopefully useful or at least a good learning experience.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC

Reddit,bitcoin,Please ban “Bitcoin lost in Welsh landfill” posts.,2025-01-11 19:32:42,"James Howells has only one goal: to get into as many news articles as possible every time Bitcoin hits a new milestone. The story generates clicks and this is good for him financially as well as for the click and karma farming idiots who keep reposting it a billion times.

There is no proof this man has ever even owned the Bitcoin he claims to have lost. Regardless, it’s scientifically impossible for a hard drive to have survived this long in an open air landfill. 

This story is literally just clickbait for online articles, unless you’re from Newport then it’s a financial burden on you because the guy keeps trying to sue local authorities just to give “news” outlets a slightly different headline to repackage the story yet again. He sued the city for £500m just because newspapers like his story and give him credibility where he has zero. He also keeps trying to scam “investors” to fund his dig, which will never happen.

This person will keep rinsing and repeating until Bitcoin hits 1 million and beyond. The only way to deal with it is to stop talking about it and to brand James Howells posts as low effort clickbait. This scam operation has gone on for long enough.

Meta is a trillion dollar company currently sitting on $70.9 billion in cash which is losing purchasing power. Decent chance this passes.”

In the 2,100 days his total investment of $2,100 is now worth $11,883 for a multiplier of 5.65X.

Bitcoin is $94,800 as of today January 10 2025.

He continues to buy $1 daily but has not updated with a new video so we can assume that his numbers are higher.

The power of compounding and DCA. 

However, a lumpsum of $2,100 back in Feb 2019 at $3,400 per BTC would have given him 0.617 BTC. 

The lesson here is regardless of when or how much you buy, the answer is just buy some.

Just sharing for fun.

In the past I've used prepaid cash cards but unfortunately I've moved countries, those are not available where I am. So that's no longer an option.

Now the only option that remains is crypto. Every exchange I've looked at requires KYC. They want your drivers license, passport, and a selfie. I think that's ridiculous. Anyway, it is what it is.

I just want to know if there's an exchange that lets me topup my crypto wallet using just a card or paypal. Once I have money in that wallet, I'll then throw it in a mixer and make it a bit more anonymous.

Reddit,bitcoin,Why are so few people using BIP85 seeds?,2025-01-11 23:01:51,"Basically the title. BIP85 seems to have serious advantages over multiple unrelated wallets since you only have to

1. Store one seed really really securely
2. If you lose your child seeds you can always recover them
3. You can store your index and passphrases (13th, 25th words) separately and even when/if someone finds them they can't do anything with them
4. It forces you to create a logical structure when assigning the indices, this way you can even remember them well.
5. You don't really need to store child wallet keys - you can always generate them on demand. If you're hodling and not selling often this is perfect. Just have a watch only wallet and NO BACKUP of your seed phrase or private keys. Whenever you need them - just restore them from the master wallet.

Reddit,bitcoin,Looking For Easiest Automated Process,2025-01-11 19:00:21,"Goal: I am looking for the simplest setup where I can set up a recurring, weekly buy to take advantage of DCA. However, I want the recurring buy to be deducted straight from my linked bank account, not money in the exchange that I have previously deposited. I then went to either manually or automatically have that BTC moved to cold storage wallet. Finally, I would like an app where I can track my portfolio, rather than managing my cost basis in an Excel Sheet or something like that.

  
Kraken: I really like Kraken's UI and I think its fees are reasonable. However, it will not allow recurring buys from your bank account linked to Plaid. You have to first deposit USD into Kraken and then the recurring buys can be debited from that. I don't want to do that. That being said, Kraken does have an API so I think linking it to an app like CoinStats or CoinTracker is an easy solution in terms of managing my portfolio. 

Strike: I like that Strike is BTC only. Strike, unlike Kraken, allows me to set up a recurring buy from my bank account with Plaid; I do not have to deposit money into Strike first. However, Strike does not have an API, and to manage my portfolio I have to download a CSV file and then convert that to some app. I would have to do that regularly. That's a strike against Strike (pun intended) for me. 

  
Is there one Exchange and one Portfolio Tracking app that can accomplish my goal? It feels like every app is almost perfect except for one key feature. I'm just looking for a simple solution.

I heard about Bitcoin in 2011, it had just spiked to an ATH of $8, so I thought I would give mining it a try.

The first few days, I was mining 1BTC/day.  Mining rate slowed drastically as BTC gained popularity.

I was sending my BTC to MtGox as it was mined, until the price of BTC crashed again.  I evidently lost interest, and promptly forgot about the \~$20 of BTC I had accumulated.

Come 2014, MtGox shuts down, taking 2/3 of my BTC with it.  I wrote it off entirely, lamenting my loss of a couple hundred $.

2021 rolls around, BTC is at an ATH of $50k.  I hear about the Mt Gox settlement, wondering if I still have my account info.  I can't find it.  
What I *do* find is my old wallet, and see there's still 2BTC in it.

Last month, when BTC hits $100k, I finally decide it's time to cash out the majority of it, for a down payment on a house later this year.

From what I've managed to put together is that if BYC stay stable/increases it will simply just show the inflated value.  So my E*trade may show that it's now $100 va $20 so it's worth would climb because of what backs it.

Reddit,bitcoin,Orange Pilled My Partner,2025-01-10 11:31:56,"This week I orange pilled my girlfriend.

A little backstory here. I have been buying Bitcoin since 2020 and dabbled in other shitcoins at the time. The past 2 years I woke up and have been purely buying Bitcoin, bought a hardware wallet, backed up my seed phrase on stamped metal washers and have been DCAing the entire time.

My partner has always been poor with money and has a fairly large chunk of debt through stupid pay day loans and overdrafts so in Autumn last year, she sold her car in order to clear some debt. Over Christmas and going into this year she had struggled without a car (we live rurally and have no public transport links) so she wanted to buy a new car to use for work.

We found a car, but as she'd put all her money into paying off debt, she has no savings. So, I leant her a chunk of money for a deposit on a sensible reliable car and she was going to pay me back each month.

I have spoken a lot about Bitcoin with her but she never really understood it, but I've given her an incentive to buy some. I got her to set up an account with Strike and have requested for her to DCA into Strike instead of paying me back and she has done exactly that.

Now she keeps asking more and more questions about Bitcoin and she's really starting to understand the benefits that it can offer to all of our lives. The next step is getting her set up with a hardware wallet, but that is another topic for later!",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,bitcoin,The US Government wanting to hold Bitcoin is the biggest inflation warning of my lifetime.,2025-01-09 22:15:51,"They can't call it a strategic reserve. The issuer of the most powerful currency in the world can't just say to the world, ""We're going to hold Bitcoin as a hedge against the dollar ... but it's cool. Just go about your business."" They can't openly undermine the only currency that they can print themselves. It would panic the world. It's basically an admission that they're going to try to print their way out of the debt crisis. 

Everyone else in the world can hold Bitcoin and it's OK. Every other country can accumulate it and it will just be seen as prudent. But not the USA. We are the only ones with control over printing the dollar. The more Bitcoin that the US government tries to quietly accumulate, the more you'll know that the dollar is in big trouble. And the US is f\*\*ked ... because they're the only ones who can't protect themselves. (Not openly anyway.) 

Addendum:
Lots of debate in this thread about the true meaning of a strategic reserve. I will offer this definition for anyone that feels like I'm misunderstanding ""strategic reserve"": 

A strategic reserve is a stockpile of a commodity, like oil, that a government or organization holds back from normal use to be released during unexpected events or disruptions in supply, allowing them to manage crises and stabilize markets by providing a readily available source of that commodity when needed; essentially acting as an emergency buffer against sudden shortages. 

But we don't have to debate the purpose of this reserve.  It's stated explicitly in the bill. 

(3) Just as gold reserves have historically served as a cornerstone of national financial security, Bitcoin represents a digital-age asset capable of enhancing the financial leadership and security of the United States in the 21st century global economy.

(4) The acquisition and long-term storage of substantial quantities of Bitcoin by the United States can strengthen the financial condition of the United States, providing a hedge against economic uncertainty and monetary instability.

(5) Bitcoin, as a decentralized and finitely scarce digital asset, offers unique properties that complement existing national reserves, strengthening the position of the United States dollar in the global financial system.

(6) Diversification of the national assets of the United States to include Bitcoin can enhance financial resilience and position the United States at the forefront of global financial innovation.

It's all about strengthening the US dollar. It isn't farm equipment.  It isn't cheese. It isn't even gold. It's a non inflatable store of value that will presumably shore up the dollar. (While undermining the reputation of the US dollar. ",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010
Reddit,bitcoin,Credible and balanced sources ,2025-01-11 10:15:59,"Hello, I’ve recently started to look into bitcoin and research. So I understand the concept of bitcoin. I understand the blockchain and how it functions etc. Now I want to understand the economics. Does anyone have any balanced resources? There’s lots of YouTube content I’ve been over and over but none seem to answer my questions. 
In theory
1) Will bitcoin become stable enough in the future to be viable as a store for wealth or means of change. From my reading it’s clear the concept of what bitcoin could be have evolved from a currency now to a store of wealth. However, if it’s a store of wealth then it needs to remain relatively stable? I guess the theory is it has limited supply. However, wouldn’t this cause constant inflation overtime. High inflation is seen has bad in tradition economics? 
2) More my own thoughts. Bitcoin would need government backing to ever become safe and stable enough for anything useful. When I say safe I do not mean unhackable. I mean for people to have confidence in its value. Historically power, military, and governments create a sense of security. That’s why the dollar is the world’s currency. People have confidence there note is worth what the people who are in power say it is. If blockchain never has this backing of power then will it be adopted by the everyday man? I know those that understand blockchain etc see its value but let’s be honest 99% of people will never understand this.

A Wall Street Bitcoin, mined and validated only by US institutions, could get a lot of traction with ETFs support, 401k, Bitcoin companies like Microstrategy, maybe even US Treasury (the so called Strategic Reserve). It would not be aligned with Bitcoin core values but could become more valuable if institutional investors converge on it. Investors around the world would buy it like they buy S&P 500 indexed funds.
People trust banks more than code. Big social media companies are converging on the same White House agenda (Meta, X). It would be very different from 2017.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Aggregated Market Analysis Using Steaks,2025-01-11 15:18:30,"with markets being boring as hell I’ve decided to share my aggregated market analysis I do each month. I love steaks, so I use a steak approach. If the steak is well-done, I’m heading out of the restaurant to spend my money elsewhere. If it’s medium I sit back and enjoy. If it’s rare I feast, and I spend. 

I use a 10 grade steak-scale.

a 10/10 is a steak cooked so dry it crumbles, euw. Time to exit.

a 0/10 steak says moo, yum. let's eat.

Here’s the recipe:

# 1. 

Grab 3-5 random trending news on google (regardless of sentiment) the past 4 weeks, and score them subjectively on an 10-grade scale based on:

**- Bullshittery**  
**- Bearish/bullish-ness**

**News 1: Meta urged to consider Bitcoin Treasury shareholder proposal:**   
Likely bullshit, but quite bullish  
Average score: 4/10, a medium rare steak. Good stuff.

**News 2: The U.S. Dollar Index at 2-year high:**   
No bullshit, and highly bearish  
Average score: 8/10, a well-done steak. euw.  
  
**News 3: Institutional Bitcoin Holdings Surge to 31%:**  
Likely not bullshit, and highly bullish  
Average score: 3/10, a rare steak. Good stuff.

The steak for news is cooked to 5.0/10 - a half good steak. I’ll take it.

# 2. 

Next I'll look at 3 of my favorite on-chain metrics to see what the underworld is up to.

I’ll grade these subjectively as well based on previous cycles ATH's.  
**- MVRZ:** 3/10, rare  
**- Puell:** 4/10, medium rare  
**- Reserve Risk:** rare, 3/10

The steak for on-chain is cooked to 3.3/10, medium rare -  a great steak!

# 3. 

Finally I Iook at my most trusted steak-thermometer on steroids that taps into all of the above at once - the alphasquared bitcoin risk score. 

**Alphasquared bitcoin risk**: 5.4/10. A medium steak. I'll have it. 

# 4. 

At last I combine them all to get my final filet: 

(5.0+3.3+5.4)/3 = **4.57/10. A medium steak.**

I’ll sit back and enjoy it, like a steak I didn’t order but kinda want anyway. What other ingredients can Improve the recipe? Lmk.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Has anyone invested in crypto domain names?,2025-01-12 00:46:42,"I bought a few back in 2019 - sold a handful since then with the best return being from a LTC mining related .org that I sold for 0.3 BTC. I own a split of self-registered domains and those I've bought off the secondary market. I like .org names and I think there is a trend that they overperform in the crypto domain market (not hugely surprising as it fits the decentralization theme) but .com will always demand the highest values I think.

I bought up a series of domains containing Buy, Sell, Trade, Wallet, Mine/Miners combined with a range of cryptos and dropped those that dropped off the market to keep renewal fees down but given the value of sales this is purely from an efficiency perspective and not a necessity. I also bought Eliminates .COM with the idea of a crypto website dedicated to the move away from fiat currency but never got round to it. 

Wondering if anyone else has bought any names - for investment purposes or with grand plans for development? Any big sales? Share your top 5 domains below!

Can't store your private keys on your phone. It's a piece of paper people often keep it where it's safest (their homes). Aside from breaking ins and theft, fire hazard is the biggest risk. Wouldn't wish it on anybody to go for a trip and then come back to a burned down house where possibly a piece of paper inside is worth more than the house and land. Well, unless you have one of these metallic private keys but I think not everyone has them. Also it's easier said than done, but finding a piece of tiny square amidst a burned down house with tons of ash, debris, wood, etc. is harder than you might think.

People are reporting house values but we still don't know what the crypto values are and I'm sure they must have kept some there.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Question regarding tactics for what to do with well/best performing coins.,2025-01-11 11:06:11,"Hi Guys

Looking for advice, also want to point out this isn't a humblebrag opportunity, I've plenty of coins in the red.

Been investing since 2021 and feel like I've gotten a little smarter with a lot of the choices I've made. Not always, I stupidly panic sold a few coins during the initial recent dip and now several of them are up 15/20%, lesson learned. I was WFH having a particularly stressful day and glancing every hour or so at my phone as it just went down about 5% every hour and got worried that the arse was about to fall out for another 4 years. Stupid, I know. 

But my question is, what is the best thing to do with well performing coins? Essentially I have 3, BTC, ETH and SOL.

BTC was something I never really put much into, so while my investment is up around 2x, the investment wasn't very large to begin with Same with ETH but I had put in a decent bit more. 

SOL is up around 5x. My main concern is that putting more money in at this price will totally skew the average price and mean that if I continue to DCA, I'm essentially filling up the top layer, it almost feels like more risk to do that, so I generally leave the best performing ones alone. Is this the right tactic, is this what others do too? I don't particularly want to sell as its currently doing well enough and still a good bit off its recent ATH.

I feel all I've been doing the last 4 years is focusing on red coins and DCA on all these alt coins and poorer performing coins, some which have worked out, some that haven't. Maybe it's just feeling like all I can focus on is the red right now, which can sometimes play on my mind and make me feel like my sole purpose is to put all my attention on these reds. I don't need to sell anything right now and I have a decent bit of FIAT. I just feel like I am at a bit of a crossroads and want to approach it as sensibly as possible. None of my friends use crypto, which is why I am reaching out here as I've made a few posts before and people are always so helpful and decent with responses.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"PSA 10 Charizard Card Fetches $200,000+ on Courtyard.io",2025-01-10 14:55:19,"In an unprecedented event in the world of collectibles, a PSA 10 graded 1999 Base Set 1st Edition Holo Shadowless Charizard card has been sold for at least $200,000 through the blockchain-based marketplace, Courtyard. This sale not only marks a significant moment for Pokémon card collectors but also highlights the growing intersection between traditional collectibles and modern blockchain technology.

I'm unsure of the exact price as there is conflicting data out there - a twitter post reposted by Courtyard says $220K, while on Courtyard's site the winning bid says $200K. I've reached out to the Courtyard team for confirmation and will update when I get clarity. Regardless, $20K doesn't make that much of a difference in terms of what this means overall for RWAs and onchain assets.  
EDIT: On Courtyard, the buyer pays a 10% premium. So that card sold for $200K, which went to Polygon, and the buyer paid $220K, $20K which goes to Courtyard. That's why there are the 2 different numbers.

The card, renowned for its rarity and perfect condition, is one of the most sought-after pieces from the Pokémon Trading Card Game's initial release. Graded Gem Mint 10 by the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), this Charizard card is from the very first edition of the Pokémon card game, making it a collector's holy grail. The 'Shadowless' designation further elevates its value, as it refers to an early print run where the card did not have a white border around the artwork, a feature that was added in later prints.

Courtyard, a platform that tokenizes physical collectibles into NFTs on the Polygon network, facilitated this sale. This particular card was tokenized while being physically stored in a Brink's vault, combining traditional security measures with the transparency and security of blockchain tracking. It can be redeemed at any time by the owner. The NFT gets burned and the card is sent to owner.

The auction attracted collectors and investors from around the globe, showcasing the increasing interest in high-value collectibles in the digital age. The final sale price of set a new benchmark for onchain physical card sales, indicating the high demand for rare Pokémon cards in both physical and digital formats.

This is validation for the growing market for tokenized assets. ""This auction isn't just about a Charizard card; it's about showing how blockchain can revolutionize the collectibles world,"" stated Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, underscoring the broader implications of this sale for the collectibles market.

The implications of such a sale extend beyond just Pokémon cards. It signifies a shift towards integrating high-value physical assets with digital ownership, potentially paving the way for more traditional collectibles to enter the blockchain space. As the market for NFTs and tokenized assets continues to mature, this sale could be remembered as a pivotal moment where the worlds of traditional collecting and digital innovation truly converged.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Have business owners here added crypto to a means of receiving B2B payments? How well has it been adopted?,2025-01-10 16:47:10,"For various regulatory reasons some foreign clients are having a hard time EFT-ing payments to us, such that we've had to resort to - \*cough\* taking cheques \*cough cough\* instead. This is a completely legitimate industry, no hanky panky here, but some American banks are hyper-sensitive (due to their state locale) and won't play nice with foreign EFT remittance.

I'd really rather not take a foreign cheque as it's a long processing time (up to 2 weeks) and a real administrative hassle. So the idea of taking crypto, like USDC has come up in our internal discussion.

To the business crypto crowd, has anyone implemented crypto as a means of B2B payments for your services/products? How was the adoption, did you get a meaningful % of users? Did you get scoffed at by any clients because they felt crypto was a laughable way to do business? Were there other hurdles, like inexperience on their end of even getting set up with a crypto account?

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21).

And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-12 00:58:20.432010
