As of today, BTC’s price has steadily climbed, hovering above $97,000 at the time of writing—a 1.3% gain in the past day. Amid this Bitcoin price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Lion has identified a meaningful decline in leverage and open interest (OI) ratios since November 21, following the presidential election. What does this indicate for the Bitcoin market? Related Reading: Could Fear Fuel Bitcoin’s Comeback? Analyst Spots a Surprising Pattern Leverage Ratio Decrease And Its Implications In a recent QuickTake post titled “Leverage ratio decreased. Risk Off,” Crypto Lion explained that the leverage ratio of Bitcoin has fallen, along with the derivatives buy-sell ratio and the OI-to-market-cap ratio. This suggests a gradual unwinding of leverage as more Bitcoin leaves centralized exchanges (CEXs). The analyst also highlighted that much of this Bitcoin has shifted to Coinbase Prime or been used to back exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating a shift toward long-term holding and possibly a broader “risk-off” stance among large investors. The analyst particularly wrote: The large decrease in the leverage ratio means that OI is decreasing relative to the CEX BTC reserve. It is important to note that the CEX reserve has been declining for a long time and has been moved to the coinbase prime and bought to back ETFs. This means that risk-off may be more advanced than it appears. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach 2022 Levels Adding to this narrative, another CryptoQuant analyst, Papi, reported a significant development in Bitcoin’s exchange dynamics. According to Papi, the largest net outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges since 2022 occurred last week, reducing the supply of Bitcoin on these platforms by 3%. The last time outflows reached a comparable scale was shortly after the collapse of FTX, a major exchange event that reshaped market sentiment. This latest exodus of Bitcoin from exchanges may signal growing confidence among institutional players and long-term holders. Despite recent price fluctuations, large buyers appear to be “stacking on dips,” as Papi noted. This behavior suggests that these entities anticipate future price appreciation and are accumulating while prices remain comparatively low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals Short-Term Holders Have Been Taking Profits – Is The Next Rally Near? The shift of funds off exchanges into private wallets or institutional custody often reflects a strategy of long-term holding rather than short-term trading, potentially providing a stable foundation for future market growth. Looking ahead, the reduced leverage ratios, coupled with significant outflows from exchanges, could point to a more cautious yet optimistic market sentiment. If these patterns continue, they may set the stage for a more sustained recovery in Bitcoin’s price and a shift toward healthier market conditions over time.

Notably, this is only the third time PEPE has reached the oversold levels in its history, particularly on the daily candlestick timeframe.  Historical data shows that in the previous two instances, PEPE’s price movement followed a specific pattern, leading to a strong recovery after a period of consolidation. As such, the recent PEPE price crash might be the first step before an incoming bull price action. PEPE Oversold Condition Is A Rare Market Event: What Happened The Last Two Times? PEPE hasn’t had much history to go by, as it is one of the youngest meme coins with a large market cap. However, over the past year and a half since its launch, PEPE has rarely dipped into oversold territory on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This makes its current oversold status a significant event in technical analysis, as it has only happened twice before. An oversold condition is when the selling pressure on a crypto becomes too much in a short period, which causes the RSI indicator to fall below 30. Related Reading: PEPE’s 64% Drawdown Theory: Analyst Reveals The Level To Hold Amid Massive Price Crash In both previous instances where PEPE became oversold, the price entered a consolidation phase lasting approximately one month before rebounding with a strong uptrend. This pattern is evident in a PEPE daily candlestick chart shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst Obi (@obi_eths), which illustrated the meme coin’s historical response to oversold conditions. As shown by the chart below, the first time the meme coin became oversold was in September 2023, four months after its launch. Notably, the oversold condition was followed by 31 days of consolidation before PEPE eventually shot up to new all-time highs in the weeks after.  A similar trend occurred in August 2024, when PEPE entered into an oversold condition for the second time. This was followed by another 31 days of consolidation up until September 6, when another uptrend began. Accumulation Phase? What To Expect Next With PEPE now entering another oversold condition, historical patterns suggest that the meme coin could remain in a consolidation phase for at least the next month. If past trends repeat, this period could serve as an accumulation window for investors who are willing to exercise patience and position themselves ahead of a potential rally.

PEPE: Analyst Reveals Which Coin You Should Hold This Bull Cycle The timeline for this anticipated surge should begin on March 10, which is exactly 31 days after PEPE entered the recent oversold condition. From here, the meme coin could attempt to mirror its past rebounds by staging an extended move that could push its price beyond its current all-time high of $0.00002803, which was recorded on December 9, 2024.  At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000009544, 65.8% below this all-time high.

Bitcoin TD Sequential Is Flashing A Buy Signal Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about the TD Sequential signal that has just formed for Bitcoin on its daily chart. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable tops and bottoms in any asset’s price. Related Reading: Just 10 Holders Control 61.3% Of Shiba Inu Supply: How This Compares With Other Altcoins The indicator consists of two phases: setup and countdown. The end of each of these phases is assumed to coincide with a signal for a turnaround in the cryptocurrency. In the first phase, the setup, candles of the same color in the chart are counted up to nine. These candles don’t need to be consecutive, just that there should be nine of them. Once the ninth candle is in, the setup is said to be ‘complete,’ and the price can be considered to have reached a reversal. The second phase, the countdown, picks up right where the setup left. It works almost exactly in the same manner, with the one exception being that candles here are counted up to 13 instead. Following these 13 candles, the asset arrives at another point of likely trend exhaustion. Naturally, where the price would go after the end of either phase depends on the polarity of the candles involved in the phase’s completion. Green candles imply a reversal to the downside, while red ones suggest the formation of a bottom. Bitcoin has recently formed a TD Sequential signal of the first type. Here’s the chart shared by Martinez that shows the pattern in the coin’s daily price: From the graph, it’s visible that the 24-hour price of Bitcoin has finished a TD Sequential setup with nine red candles recently, which suggests the asset may be due a bullish reversal. In the chart, the analyst has also highlighted the last signal that the indicator gave for the cryptocurrency. It would appear that this previous signal was a sell one and it was also right on the mark as it coincided with last month’s price top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still In Bull Market, On-Chain Indicator Confirms Given this pattern, it’s possible that the latest TD Sequential signal would also end up holding for Bitcoin. If so, it might finally help the asset shove off its recent bearish winds. Speaking of the TD Sequential, another top coin, Cardano (ADA), has also formed a signal recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. As displayed in the below chart, the pattern is a bullish one for ADA as well.

Persistent selling pressure has left investors and analysts worried about Ethereum’s ability to stage a recovery, with many starting to lose hope for a rally.  The bearish sentiment has only intensified as ETH continues to underperform compared to Bitcoin and other major assets, causing frustration among market participants who expected a stronger start to the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals Short-Term Holders Have Been Taking Profits – Is The Next Rally Near? Despite this negative outlook, there are reasons for optimism. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis revealing that Ethereum is still trading within a multi-year ascending triangle, a bullish chart pattern that could signal a significant move higher. This pattern suggests Ethereum may just be consolidating before a potential breakout into higher prices. Historical patterns have shown that ascending triangles often lead to explosive price moves when key resistance levels are breached. As ETH trades near critical support levels, the coming days will be crucial for determining its short-term direction. Investors are watching closely to see if this bullish pattern holds and whether Ethereum can regain momentum, potentially sparking a recovery that could restore confidence in the market. Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move Ethereum appears to be gearing up for a decisive move as it struggles to reclaim momentum amid a challenging market environment. Investors are growing increasingly frustrated with Ethereum’s lackluster price action, and optimism for a rally is fading.  Compared to Bitcoin and other altcoins like Solana, Ethereum has been underperforming, leaving bulls with little control over the price action. The constant selling pressure has dampened hopes for a recovery, leading many to question whether Ethereum can regain its footing. However, not all hope is lost. Top analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis on X, pointing out that Ethereum is still trading within a multi-year ascending triangle—a bullish pattern that historically precedes explosive moves.  According to Jelle, Ethereum’s price has faked out on both sides of this structure, a behavior that often suggests the next move will be the real deal. This technical setup indicates that Ethereum is building energy for a significant breakout or breakdown. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns Jelle also highlights the $4,000 mark as a critical supply zone. Ethereum has tested this level three times without success, but he believes the fourth attempt could finally break through. If Ethereum can clear this key resistance, it would mark a turning point and potentially ignite a rally into price discovery, restoring confidence among investors. Price Analysis: Key Levels To Hold Ethereum is currently trading at $2,650 after several days of selling pressure and market uncertainty. The price has struggled to reclaim the $2,800 mark since last Wednesday, reflecting a bearish sentiment that has dominated ETH’s price action since late December. Bulls are facing increasing challenges as the momentum remains on the side of the bears, and confidence among investors continues to weaken. To reverse the ongoing downtrend, bulls need to hold the $2,600 level as strong support. This price has acted as a key demand zone in the past and could provide the foundation for a recovery. However, simply holding this level is not enough—Ethereum must also reclaim the $2,800 mark and, more importantly, break above the $3,000 level to signal a shift in market sentiment.

However, failing to hold $2,600 could open the door to further downside, with the next critical support levels significantly lower.

Based on this pattern, the analyst predicted that SOL could witness a parabolic rally to a new all-time high (ATH) and provided a target that the crypto could reach.  Solana Could Rally To $565 As Ascending Triangle Forms In an X post, Trader Tardigrade predicted that Solana could rally to $565 following the formation of an ascending triangle. He noted that SOL has been forming ascending triangles before each recent breakout. The analyst added that Solana reaches its target at  Fibonacci 2.618 after each breakout.  Related Reading: Solana Price Will Complete 1,800% Surge To $4,000 With This Formation: Analyst In line with this, Trader Tardigrade predicts that Solana can reach $565 once this ascending triangle completely forms. The analyst revealed that the current ascending triangle is more than halfway complete, indicating this parabolic rally could soon happen. His accompanying chart also showed that SOL could reach this price target as early as April.  Asset manager VanEck also recently provided a bullish outlook for Solana, predicting it can reach $500 by year-end 2025. The asset manager’s analysts explained that this projection is supported by Solana’s developer dominance, increasing market share in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, revenues, and active users.  Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that Solana couldn’t rally to as high as $500 but predicted it could reach at least $350. However, he warned that SOL needs to hold above the support level at $198. In a more recent X post, he also raised the possibility of Solana reaching $380.  The analyst stated that Solana is testing a key support level at the lower boundary of the parallel channel he highlighted on the charts. According to him, holding above this support level could strengthen the uptrend, fueling a rally to $387.  SOL Needs To Reclaim The $220 Level In an X post, crypto analyst Jelle stated that the first mission for Solana is to reclaim $220. This came has he noted that SOL is holding the key support level so far. The analyst indicated that it would be ideal for SOL to bounce from its current level if its price action is to remain short-term bullish.

A solid pricing structure may open the door for a spike toward $387 in the upcoming months, as SOL presently trades at about $204. However, how feasible is this goal? Related Reading: Can XRP Hit $10,000? A Quadrillion Market Cap For The Coin If That Happens – Analyst Maintaining Key Support Levels Solana’s ability to keep vital support zones has been one of its strongest suit in recent weeks. SOL has shown positive momentum by holding steady above important levels despite general market declines. Analysts believe that if Solana can keep supporting around $200, the next upside objective might be well over $300, with $387 appearing as a possible peak. With a market value of over $98 billion right now, Solana is among the best performing assets in the last few months. Still in a strong upswing, SOL shows a nearly 3% rise in the last 24 hours. According to cryptocurrency researcher Ali Martinez, Solana is currently testing a significant support area at a parallel channel’s lower border. Such a support level is very important because if SOL manages to hold above it, the trend up might be consolidated even stronger, which can cause a pretty serious price pump. #Solana $SOL is testing a key support level at the lower boundary of this parallel channel. Holding above it could strengthen the uptrend, fueling an upswing to $387! pic.twitter.com/eZdpGCZkxr — Ali (@ali_charts) February 8, 2025 Solana’s Network Growth Surges Another factor that is increasing excitement in the area is the quick expansion of Solana’s network. Claiming to generate over 5 million new addresses in a single 24-hour period, studies indicate that usage is on the rise. An increase in demand for the token is a common consequence of increased on-chain activity, therefore this surge in user involvement could be a major driver of SOL’s price. Should this tendency continue, Solana may have an advantage over rivals, therefore enhancing its long-term optimistic case. Some analysts, nevertheless, are dubious about the viability of such explosive development and advise investors to confirm on-chain facts before making decisions. Can Solana Realistically Hit $387? Reaching the $387 level would mean that the altcoin will have registered a 91% price elevation from its current valuation. Many factors could get in the way, but some market observers believe the target is not that hard to hit. A good amount of bullish sentiment, massive acceptability of the Solana native currency, network upgrades, in addition to a conducive macro macroeconomic environment should be enough for SOL to achieve a new milestone. Historically, altcoin price movements have mirrored Bitcoin’s price trends; therefore, for Solana to climb to the $300-$400 level, Bitcoin must surpass $105,000. Related Reading: $350K Bitcoin?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin In 2025: History Could Repeat With A 2017-Style Surge,2025-02-10 15:30:49+00:00,"In a video titled “The Macro Outlook for 2025: BIG Moves Ahead,” Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI) laid out a sweeping perspective on where growth and inflation trends appear to be heading, why the upcoming cycle looks more akin to 2017 than 2021, and how Bitcoin could be primed for notable upside if its historical relationship with the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Index and global liquidity holds true. Forcast: Bitcoin Macro Summer Is Coming Bittel explained that macro “summer” is the dominant regime he sees unfolding throughout 2025, meaning growth momentum is picking up while inflation remains modest enough for central banks to avoid overtightening. He underscored that “the business cycle still chugs along,” pointing to improving global manufacturing data and to the fact that more countries have been shifting into expansion territory. Although slight fluctuations persist in some indicators, including pockets that briefly resemble a slowdown, Bittel remains confident that these do not mark the onset of a new macro “fall” with sustained growth deceleration and rising inflation. He instead suggests these headwinds will prove short-lived, given an overall environment in which global financial conditions are loosening. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Spikes On Major Exchanges — Time To Buy? He highlighted the decline in US bond yields and the recent weakening of the dollar as factors that will allow “more cowbell” from central banks. China’s bond yields have also collapsed, which Bittel sees as a major signal that Beijing can provide additional liquidity injections without fearing excessive overheating. He described this combination as an echo of 2017, a year when a softer dollar and lower interest rates contributed to an upswing in both traditional markets and cryptocurrencies. Turning to inflation, Bittel dissected why shelter and other service-related costs are such significant laggards. He observed that more than one-third of headline CPI is tied to housing, which “typically lags home prices by around 17 months,” and pointed out that shelter inflation is still keeping official CPI numbers elevated. He expects this dynamic to give central banks leeway to ease monetary policy further once they see the data turning down. While some cyclical forces, such as commodity prices, might push inflation higher later in the year, Bittel emphasizes that the peak is not imminent and that the Federal Reserve will likely retain enough flexibility to avoid stifling the ongoing economic rebound. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Lead To ‘Pain In Under 2 Years,’ Warns Arthur Hayes In discussing Bitcoin, Bittel zeroed in on the business cycle’s role in driving outsized price movements. He recalled that when the ISM Index barely hovered above 50 in 2013 and 2017, the leading cryptocurrency proceeded to rally by dozens of multiples. In 2021, the macro picture abruptly topped out as soon as ISM and liquidity peaked, cutting short the cycle and capping Bitcoin’s run at roughly an 8x move from its initial pivot out of recession. Today’s backdrop looks materially different. Bittel noted that “the ISM is just now moving above 50,” which contrasts with the late 2020–early 2021 surge that raced from the low 40s to the mid-60s almost in one breath. He added that “if we’re right about the weaker dollar and a pickup in global liquidity,” Bitcoin’s path could more closely resemble the elongated upturn of 2017 than the compressed momentum of 2021. Although Bittel did not offer a precise price target for Bitcoin, he referenced the historical precedent of a 23x jump in 2017 once the cycle gained traction. His caution was clear—he stated repeatedly that these moves are never guaranteed and that “I’m not telling you Bitcoin is going 23x,” but he also stressed that in every prior crypto run, persistent strength in the business cycle proved to be “the magic gift that keeps on giving.” He believes the foundation has been set for an extended upswing, yet reminded everyone that 20–30% drawdowns are inevitable even during powerful rallies. He further noted that “once you understand where the economy is going, you understand where assets are going,” and reiterated that liquidity, particularly from China, could become an even bigger driver for digital assets as 2025 progresses. Bittel reinforced the point, saying that “historically, the biggest surges in Bitcoin happened when the ISM is rising and we’re in macro summer.” He also highlighted that any short-term pullbacks in Bitcoin should not be mistaken for macro regime shifts. The cyclical conditions, fueled by easier financial conditions, remain in place, though he reminded viewers to expect corrections and remain patient. In his words, “it’s never a straight line,” and it can feel like “the end of the world” in some weeks. Yet, given the parallels to 2017 and the ongoing slide in the dollar, he believes the runway for Bitcoin—and other risk assets—still appears relatively long. While Bittel’s presentation also addressed broader market segments, such as commodities and cyclical equities, Bitcoin received special focus. In explaining why GMI’s macro framework still signals optimism, Bittel emphasized that “dips are for buying,” provided that investors keep a close eye on signs of any deeper structural slowdown. He stressed that “no one should forget that if you sign up for Bitcoin, you’re signing up for volatility,” but with the business cycle only just beginning its ascent and liquidity conditions gaining traction, there may be ample room for Bitcoin to move beyond its previous peaks if the data continue to favor cyclical expansion. At press time, BTC traded at $97,710. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

The foundation’s chief investment officer, Chun Lai, said that they’re keen to capitalize on crypto’s potential and wouldn’t want to risk ‘losing the train’ once this red-hot market flares back up. Moreover, the University of Austin is planning to hold the BTC for at least five years, meaning it’s in it for the long haul. With that in mind, here are the top 4 altcoins to buy and hold in 2025. Universities Jump Aboard the Crypto Train Austin’s not the only university to have joined the crypto bandwagon. Georgia’s Emory University, for instance, is holding Bitcoin ETFs worth $15M. UA and Georgia’s HODL strategies for Bitcoin are an industry-wide trend, signaling that the crypto is becoming increasingly stable.   Amidst a sea of pro-crypto developments under the new Trump administration, seeing traditional institutions like universities give crypto the green light is another testament to increasing crypto adoption and bullish times ahead. So if you’re also reluctant to miss the gravy train, here are 4 of the best altcoins to be looking at investing in right now. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Altcoin to Buy as Bitcoin Adoption Records New Landmarks Solaxy ($SOLX) is easily one of the best cryptos to buy now. This is because it’s building a new layer 2 protocol that aims to unlock the popular Solana blockchain’s full potential.  Despite being a relatively new player in the industry, Solana ($SOL) has managed to surpass both Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of price gains and trading volumes.  Now, with the launch of Solana ETFs imminent, Solaxy is likely to be the biggest beneficiary of Solana’s upward rally. Here’s our Solaxy price prediction for more insights. The network has a lot of potential, but some key issues, like network congestion and limited scalability, can disrupt transactions, which in turn hampers user experience.  Solaxy aims to fix all these issues by creating a network that’s fast-paced, low-cost, and efficient.  The project has raised $19M so far, and the token is currently available at just $0.00163. However, with prices increasing almost every other day, interested investors should get in ASAP! Here’s how to buy $SOLX. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Token to 100x Your Investment MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a self-evolving AI agent that runs its own X account where it autonomously publishes content and engages with the crypto community. $MIND gathers all the chatter around new crypto trends and market news and then churns out expert trading insights. Additionally, MIND of Pepe can also operate a crypto wallet, access other blockchain apps, and launch brand-new tokens, which would be made available to its community before going public.   Anyone who holds $MIND tokens can benefit from these exclusive insider tips to make informed investment decisions. The $MIND presale has already raised $5.6M. Currently, each token is priced at $0.0032924, offering early adopters a lucrative entry point. Here’s how to buy it. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Capitalize on the Growth of the Best Crypto Wallet App Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of the popular crypto wallet, Best Wallet. Holders of the $BEST token get additional perks within the Best Wallet ecosystem. These include lower transaction fees on each purchase/sale, voting rights on key decisions that’ll be made regarding the Best Wallet App, and early access to promising new crypto projects. The best way to understand the hype around $BEST is to look at the Best Wallet App’s potential, itself. This crypto wallet aims to take over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market in the next two years – and with over 500K current users, it’s well on its way. Given its utility within a popular crypto wallet, $BEST has emerged as one of the best crypto presales of 2025. The presale has racked up over $9.4M at the time of writing, and you can become an investor for just $0.023925. 4. XRP ($XRP) – One of the Best Altcoins to Diversify Your Portfolio XRP is the native currency of  XRP Ledger— an open-source blockchain. Both XRP and XRP Ledger were designed for the Ripple Payments network to enable faster international transactions at a cheaper rate. Transactions using XRP require minimal energy, making it one of the few sustainable crypto blockchains. XRP is a listed token currently trading at $2.42. The past week hasn’t been great for the crypto industry, with most tokens seeing a consistent decline. XRP also fell from its previous high of $3.10 to current levels of $2.4. However, analysts believe this is a temporary slump and also a great accumulation opportunity for healthy long-term gains. Bottom Line Now that we’ve discussed the best altcoins to buy as US universities make their first foray into crypto, it’s important we once again point out the overall crypto market’s volatility. As always, please do your own research before investing – the above article is not meant to be seen as financial advice. This also means only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing and having the stomach to hold onto your bets through the rapids.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,How High Can Dogecoin Go If Bitcoin Hits $1 Million? Analysts Weigh In,2025-02-10 14:00:53+00:00,"Long a wild card in the crypto scene, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been riding the waves of excitement, community passion, and even Bitcoin’s price swings. Related Reading: $350K Bitcoin? Crypto Investment Firm CEO Predicts Massive Surge Speculation on the potential price pinnacle of Dogecoin is growing given Bitcoin’s present price hovering at $96,000-97k, and some analysts predicting a whopping $1 million valuation over the next decade. The Course Of Bitcoin Towards $1 Million Several business analysts, including Jack Dorsey and Robert Kiyosaki, have noted Bitcoin’s possible price ascent to $1 million by 2030. Echoing this view, investment company Bernstein thinks that the flagship cryptocurrency might reach the mark by 2033. Should this occur, the market capitalization of Bitcoin would surpass $20 trillion, therefore outpacing the present value of gold. Founder and CEO of publicly traded Wall Street Bitcoin miner IREN (NASDAQ: IREN), Daniel Roberts contends that rising institutional adoption combined with Bitcoin’s better qualities as a digital store of value might propel the value of the cryptocurrency to unprecedented levels. “If you consider Bitcoin’s historical price trajectory, I’d be surprised if we’re not at a $1 million by 2030 given the traction of ETFs and institutional buying now,” Roberts forecasted, quoted by Livewire Markets. The ascent of Bitcoin to this astronomical level most certainly will start a market-wide frenzy. Historically, altcoins have trailed behind BTC and frequently show even more percentage increases. Many think Dogecoin would see even more extreme climb if Bitcoin skyrocketed by 900% to $1 million. Historic Performance Of Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin Originally developed as a joke, Dogecoin has outperformed the rise in many bull markets of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has risen by over 100% over the past year; Dogecoin has flown by over 200%. This tendency implies that, should another parabolic run take place, Dogecoin might beat Bitcoin in the percentage department. A 940% gain in accordance with Bitcoin’s expected rally at its present price of $0.25 would drive Dogecoin to about $2.60. But considering the Dogecoin’s track record of surpassing expectations, several experts feel a $10 price tag is not out of the question. Market Development And Meme Coin Mania Given Bitcoin’s leading stake, the larger crypto market might explode to over $40 trillion even if the market value of Bitcoin approaches $20 trillion. This would create an atmosphere where meme coins like Dogecoin, which depend on retail buzz and community support, might achieve a record-shattering price explosion. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst In past cycles, speculative trading, celebrity sponsorships, and social media trends have often drove Dogecoin’s price behavior. The meme coin is more erratic than others since the participation of people like Elon Musk has traditionally set off fast DOGE price increases. Reasonable DOGE Expectations By 2030 Although other forecasts—like those of Telegaon—suggest that Dogecoin might reach between $13 and $18 by 2030—these projections remain hypothetical. DOGE would probably need more utility, more acceptance in payments, and continuous retail interest to approach double digits. Still, should Bitcoin surpass $1 million, the price of Dogecoin might be set for a significant surge that would astound even the most bearish of investors.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,5 Meme Coins to Explode as ETH Registers Record-Breaking $883M Inflow,2025-02-10 13:02:42+00:00,"Word on the street is that Ethereum is ready for an early Christmas. The cryptocurrency’s accumulation addresses received a whopping $883M on February 7 – the highest daily inflow ever. Moreover, long-term holders are now holding over $19.24M worth of $ETH, which is also a record. This number, by the way, has jumped 20.55% in 2025, which, combined with the fact that $ETH’s price has dropped by 20.75% this year, reflects investors’ confidence in Ethereum. Simply put, an increasing number of investors are HODLing Ethereum, expecting a big move in the near future. Further evidence that $ETH’s record-breaking daily info is a bullish sign is the observation that Ethereum’s price shoots up after accumulation peaks like this. For instance, Ethereum’s price rose by 35% just two months after 244K ETH (a record at that time) were accumulated on a single day (on February 26, 2023). With Ethereum set to test (and potentially break) all-time highs, we’ve picked 6 meme coins to explode and follow $ETH on its upwards trajectory. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Meme Coin to Buy In 2025 Solaxy ($SOLX) has arrived at just the right time for Solana. Although $SOL has been pretty sensational of late – 89% gains in the last one year – plus it’s now holding support and is ready for a breakout, it has admittedly been struggling to accommodate the growing number of users. This is where Solaxy comes in. As the first layer 2 solution on Solana, $SOLX will solve the problems of network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability on the blockchain. The $SOLX presale has been well received by both retail traders and whales alike. For instance, a whale bought $122K $SOLX just over a month ago. The total presale raise now stands at an impressive $19M, with each token currently being offered at just $0.00163. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $SOLX. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Leverage AI to Become a Profitable Crypto Trader MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a one-of-a-kind fusion between AI and crypto that promises to alter how retail traders have been approaching the crypto market. It’s a self-evolving AI agent that constantly talks to crypto influencers and communities on dApps and social media sites like X, listening to their beliefs and biases regarding crypto. Next, $MIND organizes and then declutters all that information to offer trading signals and unique market insights to its token holders. Additionally, MIND of Pepe is also capable of shaping conversations and hype online, acting as a catalyst for new trending cryptos that it has recommended to its community. Simply put, this frog-inspired meme coin is poised for tremendous growth, as it’s a sigh of relief for retail crypto traders who have been struggling to make consistent profits. You can buy 1 $MIND for $0.0032924 if you get in right now. The $MIND madness has already raised over $5.5M, and it doesn’t look like slowing down. Here’s how to buy $MIND. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The Meme Coin Market Is No Longer Risky Meme Index ($MEMEX) is one of the best cryptos to buy now because it has the potential to not only change how people view the memecoin market but also attract more investors to this corner of crypto. Taking inspiration from how index funds function in stock markets, $MEMEX is the first provider of meme coin baskets. It offers four baskets of meme coins, ranging from the very safe Meme Titan Index (includes only the top cryptos in the world) to the high-risk, high-reward Meme Frenzy Index.  There’s also the Moonshot Index and the Meme Midcap Index, which offer handsome returns in exchange for a decent risk appetite. All in all, because $MEMEX simplifies and diversifies meme coin investing, it has the potential to put crypto alongside the major financial markets in the world. Meme Index is currently in presale, where it has already raised $3.5M. Each token is now available at $0.0160352, but hurry up because the price increases in the next few hours. 4. Department Of Government Efficiency ($DOGE) – Benefit from the Musk-Led New US Govt Body We’re all well aware of the OG $DOGE, but with Donald Trump winning the elections and Elon Musk getting his own way, there’s a new DOGE in town – Department of Government Efficiency. Although the name of this US government department is indeed amusing, the work it does (or at least aspires to do) is very serious. Under the leadership of Musk, DOGE wants to reduce bloated federal spending, alleviating the tax burden on US citizens. DOGE’s X account constantly updates about the good work it has been doing. For instance, the organization has apparently saved over $5B in just the last two days by terminating wasteful contracts. As a result, this ETH-based token finds itself on the list of top gainers. It’s up by a mind-boggling 35% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, with a lifetime return of over 12,000% and truckloads of more fruitful work ahead, this $DOGE (currently priced at $0.065) is undoubtedly one of the top crypto buys under $1. 5. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Unique S&P 500 Index Meme Coin SPX6900 is another meme coin that has reacted positively to ETH’s accumulation news. It has jumped by over 8% today – and nearly 40,000% in the last year! Built on the Ethereum network, SPX6900 is an S&P 500-based meme coin that has an amusing goal of reaching 69T in valuation. Of course, there’s no point digging into the “why” of this fictional index’s mission. Thanks to SPX6900’s large community (82K followers on X and over 19K subscribers on its Telegram) and never-ending social media hype, it’s currently one of the best new cryptocurrencies. Currently trading at $0.67, the token also boasts a massive market cap of $624M, which is one of the biggest in the entire industry. Verdict Everything considered, it’s worth noting that even the best meme coins to explode aren’t free from the clutches of the overall crypto market’s volatility. That’s why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable sidelining for the foreseeable future. Also, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

This is in part because of the rise of memecoins during the same period cos users need $SOL to operate on the chain.  
  
The price action has been good since then and project like Solayer are leveraging this opportunity to offer $SOL stakers new yield opportunities.

Reddit,solana,"5 Best Solana APIs, SDKs, and Plugins for Web3 dApp Development",2025-02-10 14:11:58,"Solana is taking its first steps to 2025 with impressive moves and numbers, breaking its own records of daily on-chain activities and DEX volume. As a new US President's team chose Solana to launch his $TRUMP memecoin on, the network met an incredibly high user inflow, coming even closer to mass adoption. Day by day Solana attracts more and more users and developers, which makes it the most interesting blockchain in the perspective of 2025.

Not only the SOL itself but also its ecosystem projects gained much attention and investments last month. Solana already has a vast ecosystem, but there's still so much more exciting stuff that could be built.  Moreover, the biggest ecosystem’s protocols could become not your competitors but great strategic partners as most of them provide powerful APIs and SDKs that you could integrate into your dApp! So, now is the perfect time and last chance for devs to really get into Solana and build the next big thing!

# Solana Development 101: tools and tips

If you're new to Solana, start by learning the very basics, such as exploring its core architecture and native programming language. Solana's comprehensive docs, guides, and courses are your go-tos at this stage. It's also a great time to find a missing spot of the supply on the market and come up with an idea on what to build.    

Once you're over the rookie phase, it's time to discover the most powerful advanced SDKs that will make an innovation wonder out of your Solana dApp. Here are some tools that are worth giving a shot: 

# Jupiter API

Jupiter is the major DEX aggregator on Solana with a thriving governance community. It operates unique advanced routing algorithms enabling highly efficient SPL token swaps.

Utilizing Jupiter API web3 devs can access Solana liquidity the easiest way possible. Get a quote and swap easily with this powerful API. Perfectly suitable for building:

* DeFi platforms, 
* wallets with swap functions, 
* arbitrage bots that require efficient routing between token pairs, 
* Copy trading bots 

Jupiter API is your door to Solana's liquidity, and there’s no tricky lock to open it. Read till the end to know how.  

# Raydium SDK

Similar to Jupiter, Radium is also one of the core DeX protocols on Solana, which also provides an API for you to bring innovations to SOL ecosystem. Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM), that enables permissionless trading with the implementation of liquidity pools. Raydium provides a sweeping SDK for building dApps on top and swapping tokens at a lightning-fast speed. Radium SDK is your go-to tool when you aim to:  

* Create liquidity pools and enable token swap
* Build yield farming protocols 
* Retrieve data from Solana’s DeFis with ultra-low latency
* Leveraging Raydium’s AMM for token trading in wallets or dApps.

A must-have for developers looking to integrate high-speed swaps and yield farming into their Solana dApps

# Jito MEV Client  

Jito Labs provides a wide range of Solana MEV Software and products for end-users and devs alike. The core feature of Jito is a Miner Extractable Value (MEV) implementation, allowing the creation of additional earnings by optimizing a transaction order. It gains profit for validators, devs, and users.  However, MEV could also be dangerous in terms of market inequities and security. 

JITO maximizes the benefits and minimizes the drawbacks of MEV through a groundbreaking approach to it. As a Solana developer, you should definitely check out Jito if you’re building: 

* Auto trading platforms
* Telegram bots 
* Tools for validators 
* Staking and yield farming platforms 
* Memecoin sniping bots 

If you’re building anything that requires rapid and reliable transaction execution with MEV integration - JITO is your go-to tool! 

# Yellowstone gRPC Geyser Plugin

Yellowstone Geyser Plugin enables developers to use the gRPC interface for Solana. Yellowstone gRPC is a high-performance Solana plugin built around the Geyser interface supporting both gRPC and JSON-RPC protocols. 

It empowers developers to:

* Process large real-time blockchain data streams
* Monitor on-chain activities (e.g., token mints, smart contracts executions)
* Make API calls with minimal latency
* Build dApps and DeFi platforms with optimal speed and efficiency.

Yellowstone is one of the most demanded plugins for Solana development at the moment. So whatever you building - handling large data is crucial, especially on SOL, and super easy to do with Yellowstone gRPC. 

# DAS API

Built by Metaplex Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API represents a unified interface for eased management of Solana-based tokens including coins and NFTs. This API makes it possible to store some data partly off-chain which significantly optimizes the amount of data stored on-chain and enhances the speed of interaction with assets on Solana. Extremely helpful when you need to: 

* Reduce the amount of API calls
* Compress NFTs
* Optimize assets management process

DAS API is your go-to tool to keep in your arsenal when making NFT marketplaces, SocialFi platforms, DePin and RWA projects, DAOs, GameFi, and Metaverse Applications! 

# Bonus: ORE 

If your hardware and sanity are melting after numerous hours of mining BTC in vain, there's new innovative must-win mining on Solana for you to try! 

ORE is a Solana Program that provides a PoW mining interface and capabilities. Reshaping the approach to proof-of-work, ORE makes mining on the Solana network possible.  

Unlike Bitcoin mining, where everyone works on the same task but only one miner receives the prize, ORE provides personalized challenges for miners, ensuring that no work is in vain and everybody is rewarded. 

*Note that using ORE you’ll mine $ORE, not $SOL!* 

As ORE is an SPL token there’s much more you can do with it except just mine and HODL. You can build some add-ons and analytic tools for mining, integrate them into your DeFi and swapping protocols, create new tipping or payment systems, and much more!

# How to connect to them all at once easily

You can pick one or integrate them all and make your dApp almighty, but be ready that the setup process might take quite some time and bring many hassles. Not to mention that running a Solana RPC node is not a walk in the park. 

However, I found a solution that kills all birds with one stone. Check out the GetBlock - RPC provider. Their recently launched Solana PRO RPC is a powerful machine that contains a solid suite of APIs and add-ons and is being built specifically for a certain user, which means that it’s also super secure and flexible. 

Connecting your dApp to GetBlock’s Solana PRO RPC you gain access to all the needed tools at your fingerprint, including:

* **Yellowstone Geyser gRPC**;
* **Metaplex DAS API**;
* **Raydium SDK;**
* **Jupiter API;**
* **Jito MEV client;**
* **and even ORE mining interface** 

There’s also an option to set up the SplTokenMint and SplTokenOwner indexes to your Solana PRO RPC node and add almost any other extra API you need. Join me at the GetBlock Community and let’s expand the Solana ecosystem together! ",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

But I'm wondering how do these token accounts work? It is said on the official Solana docs that every token account transaction also requires the signature of the Account Owner, no matter if it is an onCurve address or not. So you cannot make any transfers without the transaction being a multisig transaction with the account owner as a signer? Can any dev maybe chime in, I'm just wondering how these Token Accounts work in general coming from a different blockchain 😄.

Reddit,solana,"How is literally 99/100 coins, especially those on the latest list of DEX aggregators with >200k liquidity, almost always rugs?",2025-02-09 19:50:48,"I’ve been in this space for a while now, and I’m honestly just feeling so done. Every time I see a coin on the 'newest' list of DEX aggregators, especially those with over 500k liquidity and a volume of more than a million, I get this glimmer of hope like “Hey, maybe this is the one.” But no, it’s always the same damn story.

Somewhere between the first pump and the second dip, everything collapses. I can’t even tell you how many coins I’ve lost on that looked so promising at first, with huge liquidity, high volume, buying pressure, even distribution and low whales, and all the right hype. Yet somehow, they still find a way to rug. The liquidity disappears, the price crashes so fast you can’t even get out in time, and suddenly, you’re left holding nothing.

I’ve seen people talk about how “this coin is different”, but deep down, I know. I KNOW it’s going to rug, just like every other one. The cycle feels endless, and I’m honestly just tired of losing. I can’t even trust the DEX lists anymore. 

Every time I try to find something decent, it just turns into another scam. I just don’t get it—99/100 times, how are scams SO common now? Is there any real hope of finding a gem, or are we all just destined to keep getting wrecked by these scams?

Sorry if I'm too dramatic, but this was the 4th time I got rugged today. I lost 34% of my balance in just one day.

The tx sent was identical for both and just contained a simple buy request to the pumpfun program on an inactive token. The time taken includes the time taken to receive the tx confirmation using the signatureSubscribe rpc method. Helius won here by ~148k nanoseconds which equates to .148 seconds. Chainstack also gave me a rate limit error for trying to query the token balance afterwards, so it seems their rate limits are more restrictive here.

Reddit,solana,Telegrams are the ultimate meme coin killer - change my mind,2025-02-10 05:59:38,"There is NOTHING more bearish than an unregulated TG chat. NOTHING. Now hear me out before you shred me. My ultimate opinion is that TG's should be made still, and the main reason for that is to prevent these scammers in [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) threads (for those who actually use the chaotic platform to find new memes instead of some sort of pump vision platform like BullX) from convincing people to go into their stupid scam TG channels with the scam re-verify bots. Otherwise, I'd say scrap the idea of TG altogether. However, that chat should always be muted, and communication regarding working for those bags should happen in an ongoing group VC if needed. Here is why:

1. FUD is a real problem for coins. As Alfred in The Dark Knight said, ""some men just want to see the world burn"". There seems to be a certain type of meme regard whose sole goal is to ruin other people's good time. They will say whatever they can in TG's to try to kill a coin. This is literally IN ABSENCE of looking for a lower priced entry. They literally just want to kill the coin. Those that are FUDding for entry are also scumbags. A muted TG chat eliminates that problem, while still being able to have the buybot spam going and the raid links. Anyone that has anything important to say can say it on VC, if it's important.
2. The V2 scammers and the fake Safeguard bot (that asks you to ""reverify"") are getting out of hand. Like 2 scammers a minute joining talking about ""DM me immediately"" and all that shit. And the scam safeguard bot keeps getting forwarded into channels. The consequences of this are huge, and not just for the gullible regard that gets scammed. If they manage to take control of any wallets or get people to send them all their tokens, they immediately destroy the token by dumping the token onto the chain and draining the liquidity. So anyone that is holding a significant enough amount to dent the liquidity pool that is stupid enough to get scammed can destroy the token.
3. Prevent the PVP that inevitably happens when someone isn't happy a chart isn't moving up fast enough, ultimately reversing the chart. I have no emotional attachment to any token, so if I join a TG and the vibe is shit, I'm dumping the token (or alternatively not buying). I know others do the same.

Overall, there's literally nothing accomplished by having a non-muted TG chat for any token. The literal best case scenario is no TG at all, to be honest, but the pumpfun scammers get handicapped when you link a TG to the token on launch. So the next best thing is a muted TG. And for the love of god please set your buy bots to a REASONABLE minimum buy.

This cycle showed me that u can have all the money in the world and still be a cringe beta male. 

I never been envious or jealous of someone who has more . The way i think if u got more im tryna be ur friend ; learn from u and use u as motivation .

Im finally back to my old habits but it was hard . U dont realize how the culture is changing ur mental

Block the noise . Its too much noise. U dont need 100 twitter notifications and telegram groups to be successful in this space. U dont need to be staring at a computer 18 hours a day . U dont need to pay for 50 discord group subscriptions. 

Its so much manipulation and insider disguising themselves as “i got here cus i work harder than you😂🫵!! THANKS FOR PLAYING”

Reddit,solana,Solana bots are printing money… but who’s actually making the profits?,2025-02-08 21:55:38,"Alright, I need to talk about this because it’s been driving me mad. If you’ve been in the Solana ecosystem for a while, you’ve probably seen those insane bot transactions flying across mempools sniping, MEV strategies, sandwiching, arbitrage. Feels like every day, there’s some fresh “bot made $X million in Y minutes” headline. But here’s the real question: who’s actually making this money? Because it sure as hell isn’t me.

I tried running my own bot a while back as thought I was about to print cash like everyone else. Spoiler: I got absolutely wrecked))) Between failed transactions, frontrunning, and just straight-up coding errors, I basically paid Solana validators for the privilege of losing money. Meanwhile, the big boys with deep pockets and optimized code are feasting. Even the simplest sniper bots need constant tweaking to stay ahead, and if you’re slow by even half a second, forget it) someone else already ate your lunch.

At this point, I’m convinced that unless you’re a dev with insane experience (or sitting on a pile of SOL to absorb failed trades), trying to DIY this stuff is just a donation to the network. Lately, I’ve been messing with Bananagun Bot as it just copies profitable traders automatically through Telegram, so at least I don’t feel like I’m getting dunked on by algo nerds 24/7. Not saying it’s magic, but it’s definitely better than my own attempts at playing bot wars, lol. 

What do you think of these ""bot"" trends? Has anyone here actually managed to build a consistently profitable bot from scratch, or is the real money just in copying the ones that already work? Are we just providing exit liquidity for the whales who already cracked the system?",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,solana,Sniperoo scam? Let's talk about it.,2025-02-09 13:48:38,"I'm gonna go ahead and throw this out there sense no one else is.

NOVA bot recently released thier chrome plug in allowing nove to be used through the bullx neo platform.

Speed and fees are unrivaled. Paying nova fees and trading off bullx neo is amazing.

Right after this they were mass reported and at the same time sniperoo shills came out of the wood works. I'm assuming a lot of these shills from looking at thier reddit are just in it for refferal codes as the majority of them do not seem like successful traders and have no idea what they are really talking about.

I'm no genius. I make a living trading mostly worthless shit coins. My brain is probably fried from staring at dumb memes all day so maybe just maybe my thought process is out of wack here. But after the DWT fiasco and other bots who have rugged and shilled the same exact way sniperoo is doing with these refferals and spamming ads.

Really it comes down to why use an inferior bot. My back up bot is trojan or bonk after NOVA. Sniperoo literally isn't even on the list anymore. Wouldn't use it if all other bots crashed and I had no way to trade. Especially after thier horrible shilling marketing.

No I'm not a nova bot shill. My reddit is organic and I don't have refferal codes for any bots anywhere on my reddit or comments.

\- it checks the token using the solana sniffer API to determine the potential risk level

\- if the risk level is low, it buys the token

\- after a certain % of profit it sells the token

Problems i find with this:

\- speed - i probably need to spend a 1-2k extra for this bot to be among the fast ones when purchasing coins

\- i wanted to add a part where it checks the social buzz and mentions of the token to give me an idea it if is something community backed, but the twitter API could be a problem there as i want this token check to run every minute

Reddit,solana,Best Platform To Launch On?,2025-02-08 05:37:16,"Hi All!

Currently I am seeing 3 options to launch a Solana token (outside of doing the whole kit and caboodle myself on something like createmytoken etc); and I'd love some feedback from those with exp on which platform is ""better"". \*I put better in quotes because I know none of these are perfect and launching Sol memes is pretty much a trip to vegas to play ""watch the snipers"" slots - so need for that type of commentary please lol\*

1. [Pump.Fun](http://pump.fun/) \- obviously cheap, fast, huge following, pays .5 sol ""IF"" you migrate. Main question here which I can't get a straight answer on is: do they pay the .5 sol if the ""Dev""/creator also makes an initial purchase at launch? Some say yes some say no. Biggest con imo - is its rep for being scam city (well deserved) and the likelihood that I'd get rugged by snipers off the bat lol. But - the community is huge and thats helpful for a newer token who hasnt established much of a following yet. Also, I'm just kind of leary of the lawsuits popping up.
2. Moonshot (via Dexscreener) - cheap, but does have deployment fee, comes with enhanced Dex listing ($295 savings), and if i were to select raydium - pays 2 sol ""IF"" token migrates. Question here is also the same as above; is the 2 sol paid if the creator makes the initial purchase or is it only if the creator does NOT make the initial purchase? Can't tell from the docs. Also, if the creator makes the initial purchase is this considered ""liquidity"" and locked/burned or is it treated as a normal transaction that can be traded as per usual? Obvious con; community is smaller, don't see many tokens migrating from Moonshot and I've ""heard"" most will climb to just above bonding then Dump - speculation seems to be its an inside job with Moonshot /Dex.
3. A newer one - I've found ""GoFundMemes"" - super new, Ui looks janky, but I like that you can raise as little or as much you want prior to migration. They also seem to have a version that allows you to create your own tokenomics and vesting schedules. But again it looks like it showed up like a week or so ago and I don't know anybody who has launched on it .... so there's that

Any feedback would be appreciated (given its on topic and not to tell me to not bother wasting my time launching a token on Solana lol)

Reddit,solana,"Why Liquid Staking is Better Than Staking on Centralized Exchanges (and Why You Should Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase)",2025-02-06 22:52:53,"Hey,  
I have been seeing a lot of questions about staking lately, especially around liquid staking vs. staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, or Bybit. I wanted to share my thoughts on why liquid staking is the better move and why you should avoid staking SOL on Binance (bSOL), Bybit, or even Coinbase.

**1. Liquid Staking Gives You Flexibility**  
When you stake SOL through liquid staking protocols (like Marinade, Lido, The Vault or Jito), you get a liquid staked token (e.g., mSOL, stSOL, or jitoSOL, vSOL) in return. This means you can still use your staked SOL in DeFi..lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity while earning staking rewards. It’s the best of both worlds: you’re securing the network and earning yield, but you’re not locked out of using your funds.

With centralized exchanges, your SOL is locked up. You can’t do anything with it until you unstake (which can take days). That’s a huge opportunity cost, especially in a fast-moving ecosystem like Solana where DeFi opportunities are everywhere.

**2. Decentralization Matters**  
Staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase means they control the validators. This centralizes power and goes against the whole ethos of crypto. Solana is all about decentralization, and by staking with independent validators (or through liquid staking protocols that delegate to them), you’re helping keep the network secure and decentralized.

**3. The Vault Supports Decentralization by Delegating to Community-Driven Validators**  
One thing I love about liquid staking protocols like The Vault is that they actively support decentralization. For example, The Vault delegates to validators that are actively involved in the Solana community. These validators aren’t just big players with massive stakes, they’re smaller, community-driven operators who contribute to the ecosystem. By staking through The Vault, you’re not just earning rewards; you’re helping grow a more decentralized and resilient network.

**4. Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase**  
This is where it gets sketchy. Binance’s bSOL and Bybit’s staked SOL are essentially IOU tokens. You’re not actually staking on the Solana network, you’re trusting Binance or Bybit to do it for you. This adds unnecessary counterparty risk. What happens if Binance or Bybit gets hacked, goes down, or decides to freeze withdrawals? You’re stuck.

Coinbase isn’t much better. I used to stake my SOL on Coinbase because it was “easy,” but I quickly realized I was getting a lower APY compared to liquid staking or even direct staking. Plus, Coinbase takes a (35%) cut of your rewards, so you’re leaving money on the table. And just like Binance and Bybit, you’re trusting a centralized entity with your funds. If Coinbase has issues (like they did during the SEC lawsuit), your staked SOL could be at risk.

**5. Better Yields with Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking protocols often offer competitive APYs, and you can boost your returns even further by using your liquid staked tokens in DeFi. For example, you can deposit vSOL or jitoSOL into a lending platform or LP pool and stack yields. Centralized exchanges can’t compete with that.  


I used to stake on Coinbase because it felt “safe” and familiar, but once I learned more about how staking works and the risks of centralized exchanges, I switched to liquid staking. Now I use The Vault, and it’s been a game-changer. Not only am I earning better yields, but I can also use my vSOL in DeFi to maximize my returns. Plus, knowing that my stake is supporting community-driven validators through The Vault makes me feel like I’m actually contributing to Solana’s growth. It’s a no-brainer once you understand the benefits.

What do you guys think? Anyone else make the switch from CEX staking to liquid staking? ",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

I watched a couple pump and dumps go down and the charts/stats for coins seem to be 100% accurate, as soon as they go up or drop
the market cap and liquidity correlates, unlike on dexscreen where i’ll be watching market cat stay still like a possum playing dead than i’ll
check the charts and its actually 2-4k higher than it says. because of this i’ve lost out on 3-4k profit on trades ( not my actual investments obviously but roughly 4k would have been my take away if my fucking phantom wallet didn’t fail transactions.)


anyways yeah, just wondering if anyone knows if fasol is reliable/trustworthy or if anyone here actually personally uses it. Can’t find much info online or on here so just thought i’d ask, if can’t get any insight probably going to check out bullx and photon as i hear they are both pretty reliable and have fast transactions..",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

I'd love to hear experiences with and recommendations for:

* Protocols and projects
* Strategies for keeping track of deposits, moving funds where yield is good, avoiding tax headache
* Resources for learning

  
Protocols and projects I saw mentioned before:

* Aave
* Yearn
* Beefy
* Convex
* Pendle



Resources

* [https://defillama.com/yields](https://defillama.com/yields)
* [https://swap.defillama.com/?tab=earn](https://swap.defillama.com/?tab=earn)

  
I'll add to the lists, based on recommendations in this thread.

  
Personally, I think I'd like to do something with USDC. I want to split a smallish amount into a couple of different protocols, some low risk low yield and also some a bit more experimental. I'm ready to loose some of my money, I mainly want to try stuff out. I'm in Germany and ideally this will not make my taxes a complete nightmare.

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to encrypt data inside a smart contract on Ethereum?,2025-01-30 22:00:52,"Hello, everyone!

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

So, my question is: is there any way to encrypt data within Ethereum using another person's public key, whether with RSA, ECC, or some other approach? Has anything been developed to achieve this?",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Reddit,ethereum,New L2 Capable of supporting World's Population on Ethereum: Intmax,2025-01-27 05:46:19,"Anyone have thoughts or opinions on [Intmax](https://www.intmax.io/plasmanext)?  Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

Short story short: What are main advantages of wBTC on Cardano, compared to Ethereum? Why would someone choose to wrap their BTC on Cardano instead of Ethereum?",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,bitcoin,Just How Secure Exactly?,2025-02-10 21:35:21,"Bitcoin's network hashrate is reaching new ATHs. Breaking ***1 Zettahash per second*** has become so commonplace that it can escape our minds on just how insane that number truly is.

1 Zettahash, 1000 Million Terahashes, **1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10\^****^(21)****) hashes** is a number so unfathomable that we can take the security of Bitcoin's blockchain for granted.

Earth has approximately **10\^18** individual grains of sand across all of it's beaches and oceans.

>**Every single second, the amount of mining calculations collectively done by the network outnumbers the number of grains of sand on earth by a factor of one thousand.**

But it is so much greater than that. This is just the amount of hashes that happens per second. Let's extrapolate a little further.

If each block requires approximately 10 minutes of compute to find a solution, that means it takes approximately 600 seconds of this network hashrate to find a solution. That's over **600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000** hashes to find one single solution, or **6\*10\^23** **hashes.**

How big is this number? Well the number of stars in the entire observable universe is on the order of **7\*10\^22** **stars.**

>**Every single block added to the blockchain is protected by more individual calculations than the number of stars in the entire known universe by a factor of ten.**

Ok, lets do the hail Mary. How many hashes have ever been calculated for the Bitcoin network? Well using [historical Bitcoin hashrate charts](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate) and a little bit of calculus, it's easy to get a quick estimate!

As of February 2025, **5.45\*10\^28** **hashes have been approximately computed by miners since the dawn of Bitcoin.**

That's 54.5 Billion Exahashes, 54.5 Million Zettahash, 54,500 Yottahash, or **54.5** [**Ronnahash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_prefix)**.**

This is approximately the same amount as the observable universe is wide. ***in centimeters*****.**

Also… if you are a running it like a daily miner or a lottery, are you also “helping the cause” by “running a node” ?

These concepts are really abstract. 

I have tried to understand the white papers. 

I have virtually no computer literacy but am trained in human anatomy & sciences as they apply to healthcare. 

I posted a similar question and was told to just dust off an old lap top & “run a node”

Reddit,bitcoin,Suggestion? Or just following the trend?,2025-02-10 18:27:46,"I have been here for a while and I have seen many people being driven by emotions in discussions about Bitcoin, especially when prices are rising. Some people may make overly optimistic statements in this craze, encouraging others to ""buy in"" and ignoring the uncertainty of the market. Such behavior is essentially irresponsible speculation, but lacks in-depth analysis of the market and real help for novices, misleading novices to follow the trend and suffer serious losses.



I have found in some posts that some people may advocate that the price of Bitcoin will inevitably continue to rise, or predict that there will be huge profit opportunities in the future. Such statements can easily mislead newcomers who are not familiar with the market, especially those who use Bitcoin as a tool to get rich quickly and ignore its risks.



Others are too aggressive in the forums, boasting that Bitcoin is the ""ultimate currency"" of the future, and completely ignoring or simplifying real-world challenges such as regulatory issues, scalability, environmental impact, etc. While Bitcoin is indeed innovative, it is irresponsible to over-exaggerate its potential without mentioning its limitations.



For novices, it is important to understand the potential of Bitcoin while also understanding its limitations and risks in order to make wise decisions.



Regardless of personal investment goals and risk tolerance. As a high-risk asset, Bitcoin is not suitable for everyone to invest in, especially for novices who do not have sufficient knowledge and experience. Bitcoin investors should have their own independent thinking and establish rational strategies that are in line with their own financial situation and investment goals.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,bitcoin,"Novice opinion: The more I look into bitcoin the more I believe it's a bubble, possibly a scam, and inferior to fiat. What am I missing?",2025-02-10 21:00:27,"First I want to acknowledge that I don't regard myself as well informed to all the intricacies of bitcoin, fiat, and how the world works lol. I'm a novice trying to learn. I also don’t believe our current monetary policy is without its major concerns and flaws the more I look into it. To note, a lot of this is directed at the idea of transitioning over time to full US/world adoption of bitcoin as main currency. These are my thoughts so far on bitcoin vs fiat:

1. You hear it all the time: ""We keep printing money, Bitcoin takes currency out of the hands of government and gives control to the people, its supply is fixed, no inflation, stable"". But it seems a fixed supply currency would make it more difficult to get through economic shocks and disasters. People stop spending money and only buy essentials. Plus the value is always going to increase as new things get introduced, which could result in people holding onto their money since they know it will go up in value over time, which results in less investment, less economic growth, harder to restart the economy after a major event that causes recession. Many people point to the Great Depression as an example. It seemed a mostly fixed money supply made it last longer than it would have with fiat. It literally took another disaster to get us out of the Great Depression, WWIl. Who knows how much longer it would have lasted. Then there’s the Great Recession. We got out of it through fiscal and monetary stimulus. Same with Covid (I think government could have handled it better). To me the current pendulum model of balancing interest rates and inflation makes sense. They give controls to help keep a relatively stable modern growth economy. It’s not perfect, and hopefully it gets better, but why throw the baby out with the bath water for something so extreme that imo appears to have major flaws from a pure macro economics standpoint?

2. “Bitcoin will give more purchasing power to the poor and those in developing countries”. Ok. What happens to the people with no bitcoin or very little if US/world transitioned to bitcoin? The top 1% of holders already own vast majority of bitcoin yet make up fractions of a percent of the population. I've heard people say ""well those holders would then sell some of their coin off, so the rest of the world will get pulled in"". This sounds like an extremely small ruling class of the world. I think this is a moot point though, not likely to happen because the world is too complicated with all the countries and different economies, you won't get all onboard. We live in a democracy. Even if you could put it to a popular vote, I don't think us citizens would adopt bitcoin because most don't own any. If they did vote yes, then they aren't too smart imo (unless l'm totally missing something here). There's the anarchy option, but we're probably already screwed at that point.

3. Maybe bitcoin doesn't become the us/world currency, but it still stays around to be used as a form of currency. I'm guessing the price will plummet after all are mined, but maybe stay high on the hopes it will be fully adopted, idk. Would it still be tied to the dollar? Maybe it's worth more than the dollar for some of its utility, like easily exchanging value between users in different countries? But with other technological advances coming I could see it becoming obsolete.

4. This isn't really a direct argument against Bitcoin or the future of it, but more so the feeling I get with how it came into existence and the hype around it now. Satoshi the phantom... could be dead, could have forgotten his passkey, or is the miracle altruistic hero of humanity. This is seriously fishy, cause for concern, the lack transparency. Then there's the pure speculation and hype of it all. So many people pushing it, yet not trying to fully explain it other than ""it gets money out of the hands of government"" ""inflation bad"" ""fixed supply good"". It seems no one fully understands it and the reasons I hear over and over are oversimplified. Almost everyone I know who owns bitcoin bought it because everyone is telling them to, and they are planning to sell it when they've made a good profit and have their dollars back. When the masses are being told they should buy something, to get onboard quickly before all the coins are taken, using oversimplified reasons, or even if someone does try to understand it's extremely difficult.... this doesn’t sound good at all. Again, l'm a novice and only have bits and pieces of information.

Most of my assets I want to keep for at least a year. But I got a bit tired watching my Cryptos go up and down constantly - and I'm guessing smo is making profits out of this...  So I am thinking to take a small portion to try out Range-Trading.

E.g. in the current phase buy BTC at 97k Sell at 102k. When at some point theres a bigger push, find a new support & resistance level and continue the scheme.

Who has experience with this and what tips can you give?

# 2) Getting a Wallet

So far I've been holding on Kraken. If I'd start range trading there I'd first sell the coins I first bought = highest taxes. So I want to put all my assets in a wallet, that ideally allows me to choose the assets based on time I bought them for trading (LIFO).

a) Which wallet?

Looking for a safe, easy to use affordable wallet. Smo recoomend Ledger Nano X Does that make sense for my use case? Other suggestions and why?

b) Where to trade cheapest

Obviously for this to work, the fees and spreads have to be good. Kraken is ok - but maybe theres a better way?

c) Safety

We are using Snapshot for voting directly with the Moon balance in your wallet, in a transparent and open manner. For now all Moons held in self-hosted wallets at the time of poll creation will be eligible to vote, so if you are holding Moons on an exchange, the telegram TipBot or in a wallet that you are not comfortable connecting to snapshot then please be sure to transfer your Moons to a self-hosted wallet that you are comfortable connecting to snapshot before each Moon Week. 

To give exposure to our governance polls for the month, this Moon Week post will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until next Monday. You can [see our schedule here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=i0e5as6q033nruqck5c9nfk24k%40group.calendar.google.com).**Please review the following important information first:**

* In the event of incompatible polls passing, the poll with more Moons voting in favor will be considered the winner and the other will not be implemented.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Your thoughts on the ""stable"" coin USDN",2025-02-10 19:19:50,"I recently came across a new stable coin called USDN offered by a decentralized exchange platform named Smardex. It appears that they have a feature which allows users to swap Ethereum and potentially USDT to their proprietary stable coin, USDN. This caught my interest, and I’m curious if anyone else has encountered this before?

What makes USDN particularly intriguing is their advertised 58% APR just for holding the coin in your wallet. This is quite an attractive proposition, and it has piqued my interest significantly. However, I am a bit cautious, as it sounds almost too good to be true. I would like to give it a try, but I want to ensure it's a sound investment and not something that might lead me into complications or unforeseen issues down the line.

From what I understand, there are two main avenues to acquire USDN: you can either mint new USDN coins or swap existing cryptocurrencies to USDN. The prospect of such high returns is tempting, yet it’s crucial to assess the reliability and legitimacy of Smardex and their offerings. Before taking the plunge, I would like to gather more insights from others who might have experience with USDN to determine whether it’s genuinely worth the risk, or if it would be wiser to approach this offer with caution.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin “A Financial Black Hole”,2025-02-10 20:59:49,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis’t podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles—expensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it’s “digital gold”? He’s not buying it. 

“Cryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,” Fama said. “They don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,” he concluded.""

*Is E. Fama right about Bitcoin being worthless, or is he way off? What do you think guys?*

The good thing is that I barely put any money in , but I was considering it … glad I didn’t .  I didn’t realize how much the meme space has gotten to him  - an addiction has taken over. I think in his mind he thought he could 100x the tiny bit he took and we would be in a better place  . He has 0 to his name and this was where he could get a little . It really hurts to see a friend act like this . The addiction is straight up disturbing and i know now he has a problem. I feel partially at fault because I  introduced  him to crypto in the first place.  The thing is , the memes never affected me , I was more into utility and less so about trading and dumping- it was just a joke  . This has opened my eyes a bit. ",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Can customers actually do XRP-based money transfers through conventional banks?,2025-02-10 01:12:05,"I'm from a country with a very archaic and anti-competitive banking system. From what I've read, at least one chain of major national banks has some affiliation to XRP, but I haven't seen anything about how to do faster and less expensive money transfers via XRP from that bank. XRP isn't mentioned anywhere on its website, and that got me wondering how banks even refer to XRP-based money transfers - to the extent that they acknowledge XRP or crypto to their customers at all.

Do any banks where you live actually let you transfer fiat money via XRP? If so, do they refer to such transactions as ""wire transfers,"" ""XRP money transfers,"" or something different? Also, wouldn't both the sending bank AND the receiving bank need to support XRP for this sort of transfer to go through?",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Cboe BZX Exchange has filed requests with U.S. regulators to launch the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On February 6, the exchange submitted filings for four asset managers Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs would track the price of XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.
These filings notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about a proposed rule change. If approved, these would be the first XRP ETFs in the U.S.

Earlier, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved in early 2024.

Now, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who is seen as more supportive of crypto, there has been an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. Analysts believe issuers are testing what new crypto products the SEC, possibly influenced by a Trump administration, might approve.

I think we are now getting a lot of adoption and attention towards crypto .

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Polygon & the Super Bowl: From Reddit Avatars to Polymarket’s $14M Bet,2025-02-10 06:56:27,"Today I crossed with this interesting [Tweet ](https://x.com/p_petertherock/status/1888697925423055196)sharing data regarding the NFL Super Bowl on Polygon.

As you may know, two years ago Reddit had a Reddit Collectible Avatars marketing campaign for the NFL Super Bowl LVII and they gifted event related avatars to the users that claimed them. Like this one:

https://preview.redd.it/otzpr7cxe9ie1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c11a4bcb1012357f0045a9d85d05fa4b335dfe3

This whole event minted 2,124,854M Collectible avatars on Polygon Network. Unfortunately Reddit next year's Superbowl tried something similar but making them too expensive and not achieving that great success.

https://preview.redd.it/c8bpje8ye9ie1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cab97c93ac7dbe580b8c5584b3c01b2ac694c6c

This year unfortunately Reddit didn't organized any kind of Superbowl Reddit Collectible avatars related event but this time we have another protagonist, Polymarket.

Polymarket is making Polygon once again the center of the action in this Super Bowl LIX with $14 million in active positions across 478 Super Bowl related markets.

https://preview.redd.it/8f4j0vcze9ie1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8ea4f64ae9bf83243e247b50eab8bb720ee9d0

Polymarket is having +$414M in betting volume as you can see in the image below.

https://preview.redd.it/0ezm6db0f9ie1.png?width=2866&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ed80ca307de721aead71c5cc9a0fadedeb4a61

Polygon continues to cement its presence at the NFL Super Bowl, and this time, it’s through **Polymarket**, the popular decentralized prediction market.

https://preview.redd.it/ufc4f8yoa9ie1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac766257a4ac5282666da10bacf6056bb6815594

Polymarket is really gamblers paradise xD

With all of this I just want to show that Polygon has probably one of the most used real use of cases even if it is a casino and its bringing a lot of money and people to Polygon ecosystem building a unstoppable ecosystem that pushes adoption in crypto. And this is just the beginning because one AggLayer starts being operative it will be easier than ever to move money between layers to participate on fun dApps like Polymarket. Polygon is about to wake up.

But apparently he doesn't see an issue with 20-25% of supply (lost wallets) being taken by quantum computing.  

That's quite the rosy take on it.  I'd imagine smart money would exit ahead of this for 3 reasons.    
  
Potential panic as wallets ""wake up"" at an alarming rate.    
Potential panic at what the price impact could be.    
Potential panic of people worrying others will panic.

  
I actually think there is a much better approach - that I've written about before.    
  
I was told it was a bad idea.  My guess is people either didn't get it, or didn't like the idea that quantum computing requires solutions, starting now to properly be ready without disruption.

This certainly is not a narrative, it isn't FUD.    
  
The biggest players in the world recognize it- and that includes the CEO of Tether.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I have a question about microstrategy and executive order 6102,2025-02-10 10:55:12,"Hey,

I've been doing some research on the history of money and how money works and all that fun stuff, and I just had this question like a few minutes ago in my head that I want an answer for, but before my question I just want to link this from the wikipedia:

**""Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 (equivalent to $487 in 2023) per troy ounce.""**

What if, US government sees it as a threat that all money is flowing into bitcoin and notices, that all countries have been adapting bitcoin into their reserves and feels like they are falling behind? Can't they make another executive order for let's say Microstrategy, that either all their shares, or all their bitcoin has to be forfeited to the US government, either for free, or for some fee such as the current market price.

I understand that this is not an issue for bitcoiners with small holdings, especially the ones who have kept their mouths shut, but for businesses and larger corporations that have to report their BTC holdings, what prevents another executive order from forcing companies like MSTR to forfeit all the bitcoin to the US government?

I'm not the best at explaining and asking stuff, but I hope you guys understand where I'm going with this, like don't people like michael saylor or companies such as MSTR with bitcoin reserves have some risk involved in owning bitcoin, since they still have to answer and do as the government tells them to at the very end? I'm a firm believer of self-custody and I had this question for the people that own MSTR stock, like ""what if? not your keys not your coins, right?""

EDIT: This post got auto-removed by BTC subreddit, so I'm posting it here. ",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I made an Open source tool to help you backtest your trading or investment strategy,2025-02-09 13:37:41,"Backtesting a strategy means applying it to a historical dataset and seeing how it would have performed on past data. The results should then determine if this is a potentially viable strategy to start live trading/investing with, or whether it needs some more fine-tuning.

The problem with backtesting strategies is that it usually requires you to pretty much re-write your backtesting algorithm because each strategy needs to be configured to act in a specific way. To get around this issue, I made a simple tool that allows you to easily create plug-and-play strategies and slot them into the Backtester.

The tool is written in Python and uses the Backtester py library to handle backtesting and reporting. Because it's modular it's very easy to code a strategy and test it. For instance, here's how you'd go about coding a Buy The Dip strategy:

    class BuyTheDip(Strategy):
        def init(self):
            pass
    
        def next(self):
            current_close = self.data.Close[-1]  # Current candle's close
            previous_close = self.data.Close[-2]  # Previous candle's close
            price_difference = (current_close - previous_close) / previous_close * 100
    
            if price_difference <= -5:
                self.buy(
                    size=0.1, sl=stop_loss * current_close, tp=take_profit * current_close
                )
                print(
                    f""Bought at {current_close}, which is a {price_difference}% from previous close ({previous_close})""
                )
            else:
                print(f""Did not buy, price difference is only {price_difference}%"")

Here, we want to buy Bitcoin every time the price drops by more than 5% compared to the previous candle close.  
Running the strategy will output its performance like so:

https://preview.redd.it/itzhrks3o3ie1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=191567e62b2d5271c929805c05141aed28e944e6

Buy and Hold Return%, Return %, Win Rate and Profit Factor are metrics you need to look out for. 

* Buy and Hold return tells us whether it's more advantageous to simply buy and hold rather than trade over that specific period
* Return % is the amount of profit made trading
* Win Rate is a percentage showing how many of our trades are profitable. As you can see buying dips and selling them at a 5% take profit gives us a 90% profitability rate.
* Profit Factor represents the gross profit divided by the gross loss

The backtester will also plot the performance, showing you the entry and exit positions on a candlestick chart.

https://preview.redd.it/hjvf15c1o3ie1.png?width=3771&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff61f16011326f21560cb4bcc4e59f4e89d5aed1

In my example, I used CoinGecko API to fetch historical data, but you may use any data source you wish, as long as you feed it candlestick data.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,This space is full of absolute fucking losers,2025-02-07 23:17:28,"Sorry all - but this isn't the crypto community I remember from the last cycle.

Unfortunately, I have to go to x/twitter to get the latest dialogue for what is happening in blockchain.  This sector is infested with people (mostly men) who are some of the biggest fucking losers I have ever seen.

And yeah, I get it man, you got 7 figures in your phantom wallet.  You got a nice house, you got a big dick, you fuck beautiful women.  I get it guys, ""YOU WON"".  But you know what else?  You are the biggest losers I have ever seen.

These guys can't stop talking about sucking trumps dick, fondling elons balls.  Man - what in the fuck happened to this space?  This isn't what we were looking forward to the last cycle.  Whatever *this is* is some sick, twisted nightmare of what we all thought decentralization could be.  This isn't what I signed up for and I am definitely not down for this sick, twisted, fascist shit.

I hate what has happened to this space and I hate the type of people it attracts.  It was always there, but now it is entirely too emboldened.  It's too bad there is a silver lining of something good somewhere wayyyyyyy underneath.  I honestly hope Satoshi is still alive, and when the US government makes the biggest gamble in history on BTC, I hope he rugs the entire thing and sends that disaster leadership to the end of a terrible regime.

Sorry guys for the vent, but this space is full of toxic, loser, parasites and it only seems like it will get worse.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Comprehensive Guide for Technical Analysis,2025-02-10 08:38:39,"Comprehensive Guide for Technical Analysis

TL;DR:

	•	Bollinger Bands: Price touches the upper band, signaling potential overbought conditions—watch for a reversal.
	•	Moving Averages (50/100/200-day): Price above all MAs suggests a strong uptrend—look for buying opportunities.
	•	EMA Cross: A ""Golden Cross"" (21 EMA crossing above 50 SMA) signals bullish momentum—consider a long position.
	•	MACD: A bullish crossover below the zero line suggests a trend reversal—potential buy signal.
	•	Stochastic RSI: A move above 20 from oversold conditions signals possible upward momentum—buy if confirmed.
	•	Pivot Points & Fibonacci Retracements: Price bouncing at 61.8% Fibonacci level suggests strong support—buy opportunity.
	•	Triple EMA (TEMA): Price crossing above TEMA confirms bullish momentum—use as trade confirmation.
	•	VWAP: Price staying above VWAP suggests intraday bullish sentiment—day traders may enter long positions.

The Trading Strategy:

1. Buy Signals (Below VWAP & 200-Day MA)

Buy when TEMA is near/below Bollinger Bands and price is at pivot support (S1, S2, S3).

Confirm with MACD bullish crossover and Stochastic RSI rising above 20.

2. Sell & Take Profits (Near VWAP & Pivot Resistance)

Take partial profits at VWAP or pivot resistance (R1, R2, R3) if price stalls.

Hold if momentum remains strong (high volume, MACD bullish).

3. Bullish Trend (Above VWAP & 200-Day MA)

Buy pullbacks to VWAP, 200-day MA, or pivot support in an uptrend.

Confirm with 50 > 100 > 200 MA alignment and MACD strength.

4. Final Sell Signals (Overbought Conditions)

Sell when TEMA crosses above upper Bollinger Band and reverses.

Take profits at R2/R3 pivots; confirm with MACD/Stochastic RSI overbought signals.

5. Use Moving Averages & Pivot Points for Trend Confirmation

Short-term: 9, 21, 50 EMA.

Swing trading: 50, 100, 200 SMA.

Pivot Points: Buy at S1-S3, sell at R1-R3.

Key Tip: Volume confirms breakouts—watch for strong moves above/below pivots!

This guide explains how to use various indicators for technical analysis (TA) in crypto trading, including:

	•	Bollinger Bands
	•	50-Day, 100-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages
	•	Moving Average EMA Cross (MA with EMA Cross)
	•	MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
	•	Stochastic RSI
	•	Pivot Points (Standard & Fibonacci Retracements)
	•	Triple EMA (TEMA)
	•	VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)

Each section details how the indicator works, how to interpret it, and how to use it in trading strategies.

1. Bollinger Bands

What It Is:

Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that consists of three lines:
	•	Middle Band: A 20-period simple moving average (SMA)
	•	Upper Band: Middle band + (2 × standard deviation)
	•	Lower Band: Middle band - (2 × standard deviation)

How to Interpret:

	•	Price touching the upper band → Overbought (potential sell signal)
	•	Price touching the lower band → Oversold (potential buy signal)
	•	Bands expanding → High volatility
	•	Bands contracting → Low volatility (potential breakout incoming)

Trading Strategy:

	•	Breakout Trading: Look for price to break above or below the bands after a period of contraction.
	•	Mean Reversion: If price moves far outside the bands, it may revert to the mean (middle band).

2. 50-Day, 100-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages

What It Is:

Moving Averages (MAs) smooth price action over a set period to identify long-term trends. The most commonly used moving averages are:

	•	50-Day Moving Average (50 MA): Short- to mid-term trend indicator.
	•	100-Day Moving Average (100 MA): Medium-term trend indicator.
	•	200-Day Moving Average (200 MA): Long-term trend indicator.

How to Interpret:

	•	Price above the 50 MA → Short-term bullish trend
	•	Price above the 100 MA → Mid-term bullish trend
	•	Price above the 200 MA → Long-term bullish trend
	•	Price below these moving averages → Bearish trend signals

Trading Strategy:

	•	Buy when price bounces off the 50, 100, or 200 MA as support.
	•	Sell if price rejects these levels as resistance.

3. Moving Average EMA Cross (MA with EMA Cross)

What It Is:

The Moving Average EMA Cross (MA with EMA Cross) is a trend-following indicator that tracks the relationship between a simple moving average (SMA) and an exponential moving average (EMA).

	•	SMA (e.g., 50-day SMA): Smooths price over a fixed period.
	•	EMA (e.g., 21-day EMA): Gives more weight to recent price action.

How to Interpret:

	•	EMA crossing above the SMA → Bullish signal
	•	EMA crossing below the SMA → Bearish signal

Trading Strategy:

	•	Golden Cross: A short-term EMA (e.g., 21 EMA) crosses above a longer SMA (e.g., 50 SMA) → Strong bullish signal.
	•	Death Cross: A short-term EMA (e.g., 21 EMA) crosses below a longer SMA (e.g., 50 SMA) → Strong bearish signal.

4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

What It Is:

MACD consists of:

	•	MACD Line (12 EMA - 26 EMA)
	•	Signal Line (9 EMA of the MACD Line)
	•	Histogram (Difference between MACD and Signal Line)

How to Interpret:

	•	MACD Line crossing above the Signal Line → Bullish (buy)
	•	MACD Line crossing below the Signal Line → Bearish (sell)
	•	Histogram shrinking → Weakening trend
	•	Histogram expanding → Strengthening trend

Trading Strategy:

	•	Look for crossovers at key support/resistance levels.
	•	Divergence between MACD and price → A potential trend reversal.

5. Stochastic RSI

What It Is:

A momentum oscillator that compares the RSI of an asset to its past performance. It ranges from 0 to 100.

How to Interpret:

	•	Above 80: Overbought (potential reversal or pullback)
	•	Below 20: Oversold (potential buying opportunity)
	•	Crossovers:
	•	%K line crossing above %D line → Buy signal
	•	%K line crossing below %D line → Sell signal

Trading Strategy:

	•	Use with trend confirmation: Look for overbought/oversold signals in conjunction with price action and volume.

6. Pivot Points (Standard & Fibonacci Retracements)
What It Is:

Pivot Points help identify support and resistance levels based on the previous day's high, low, and close.

	•	Standard Pivot Formula:Pivot Point (P) = (High + Low + Close) / 3
	•	Resistance levels: R1, R2, R3
	•	Support levels: S1, S2, S3
	•	Fibonacci Retracements:
	•	Key levels: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%
	•	Price often retraces to these levels before continuing its trend.

How to Interpret:

	•	Price breaking above a pivot point → Bullish continuation
	•	Price breaking below a pivot point → Bearish continuation
	•	Fibonacci levels as pullback zones

Trading Strategy:

	•	Use pivot points to set entry/exit points.
	•	Combine Fibonacci retracements with support levels for high-probability trades.

7. Triple EMA (TEMA)

What It Is:

The Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) is a faster-moving version of an EMA that reduces lag.
How to Interpret:

	•	TEMA moving up → Strong bullish trend
	•	TEMA moving down → Strong bearish trend
	•	TEMA crossing below price action → Potential support
	•	TEMA crossing above price action → Potential resistance

Trading Strategy:

	•	Use TEMA for short-term trend confirmation.
	•	Use with MACD or RSI to avoid false signals.

8. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
What It Is:

VWAP is the average price of an asset weighted by volume over a given period, often used by institutions.

How to Interpret:

	•	Price above VWAP → Bullish (buyers in control)
	•	Price below VWAP → Bearish (sellers in control)
	•	VWAP acting as support/resistance → Strong level to watch

Trading Strategy:

	•	Intraday trading: Buy when price pulls back to VWAP in an uptrend.
	•	Confirm trends: If price stays above VWAP for most of the day, expect higher highs.

Example: Applying Technical Indicators to a Cryptocurrency

1. Bollinger Bands

	•	Setup: Apply a 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) with bands set at 2 standard deviations.
	•	Observation: The cryptocurrency's price touches the upper band after a period of low volatility (narrow bands).
	•	Interpretation: This may indicate an overbought condition and a potential increase in volatility.
	•	Action: Consider monitoring for a possible price reversal or pullback.

2. Moving Averages (50-day, 100-day, 200-day)

	•	Setup: Plot the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day SMAs.
	•	Observation: The price is above all three moving averages, with the 50-day SMA above the 100-day, and the 100-day above the 200-day.
	•	Interpretation: This alignment suggests a strong bullish trend.
	•	Action: Look for buying opportunities, anticipating the continuation of the uptrend.

3. Moving Average EMA Cross

	•	Setup: Use a 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA).
	•	Observation: The 21-day EMA crosses above the 50-day SMA.
	•	Interpretation: This ""Golden Cross"" indicates potential upward momentum.
	•	Action: Consider initiating a long position, expecting further price increases.

4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

	•	Setup: Use default settings (12, 26, 9).
	•	Observation: The MACD line crosses above the signal line below the zero line; the histogram shifts from negative to positive.
	•	Interpretation: This crossover suggests a potential bullish reversal from a prior downtrend.
	•	Action: Consider entering a long position, anticipating a trend reversal.

5. Stochastic RSI

	•	Setup: Apply with standard settings.
	•	Observation: The Stochastic RSI crosses above the 20 level from below.
	•	Interpretation: This move from oversold conditions suggests potential upward momentum.
	•	Action: Consider buying, especially if confirmed by other indicators.

6. Pivot Points and Fibonacci Retracements

	•	Setup: Calculate based on recent price action.
	•	Observation: The price retraces to the 61.8% Fibonacci level, coinciding with a standard pivot point.
	•	Interpretation: This confluence suggests a strong support area.
	•	Action: Consider entering a long position at this support level, anticipating a bounce.

7. Triple EMA (TEMA)

	•	Setup: Apply a 50-period TEMA.
	•	Observation: The price crosses above the 50-period TEMA.
	•	Interpretation: This suggests strengthening bullish momentum.
	•	Action: Use as additional confirmation for existing or new long positions.

8. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)

	•	Setup: Apply to an intraday chart.
	•	Observation: The price consistently stays above the VWAP during the trading session.
	•	Interpretation: This indicates intraday bullish sentiment.
	•	Action: Day traders might consider maintaining or entering long positions, with VWAP acting as dynamic support.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"The Fun Fact About Crypto: Holding Numbers, Owning Nothing",2025-02-10 08:34:54,"When you ask a crypto holder what they actually own in the amount shown in their wallet, they will likely say something like ""an asset"" or ""a store of value."" But that’s not true. The fact is, they own nothing. They hold a number but own nothing.

To see why, let’s first understand what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value.

Imagine you are holding 500 units of wheat. In this case, you don’t just hold a number; you own something real, an asset. Why? Because wheat has the potential to fulfill people’s nutritional needs. It can be consumed as food, which is essential for survival. That is value. The wheat itself stores this value within it. The number “500” is merely a way to express the amount of that stored potential. The bigger the number the bigger the potential. 

Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you hold 500 dollars. This, too, is an asset. Why? Because the dollar holds the potential to fulfill people's needs, the needs to pay debt. Namely, every dollar in existence comes into circulation as a loan, either through a commercial bank lending money to individuals or businesses or through a central bank purchasing government bonds. These obligations create a real, tangible need for dollars, just as the biological necessity of food creates a need for wheat.

Just as biology enforces the need for food, banks enforce the need for dollars through loan contracts and collateral, ensuring that debtors must obtain dollars to settle obligations they signed. In this way, dollars store value, just like wheat. The value of the dollar comes from its ability to meet people's needs. If you hold 500 dollars, you own a specific amount of this potential to fulfill people’s needs. Once again, the number “500” is simply an expression of the amount of that potential. The bigger the number the bigger the potential. 

The same principle applies to digital goods. If you own a collection of music files, e-books, or software, you own assets because these things hold the potential to entertain, inform, or assist with tasks like writing or data analysis. Their value comes from their ability to fulfill people's needs. The more units of these digital assets you own, the more needs you can fulfill.

Now, let’s compare this to crypto. When you hold a number in your wallet, do you own a specific amount of food, music, e-books, or software licenses? No. That number does not represent anything that fulfills people’s needs.

Is that number issued as a debt obligation like dollars? No. Does the crypto system store loan contracts, collaterals, or government bonds like the banking system? No.

Therefore, if you hold one crypto unit, your potential to fulfill people’s needs is zero. If someone else holds 1,000,000 crypto units, their potential is not a million times greater than yours - it is still zero. Both of you own zero potential to fulfill people's needs.

This means crypto is not an asset. It does not store value. It is simply a system that assigns numbers to addresses and records those assignments in a digital ledger.

Some argue that crypto’s value comes from scarcity, often pointing to Bitcoin’s 21 million cap. But scarcity applies to assets. If you limit the amount of wheat or dollars in circulation, their ability to fulfill people's needs remains. But in crypto, there is no asset to be scarce, just numbers on a ledger. Therefore, the 21 million cap is not scarcity; it is merely a mathematical rule limiting the sum of assigned numbers in the system.

One of the most praised features of crypto is its simplicity and speed. But why is it so fast and easy? Because it does not manage any assets. Managing assets is inherently complex.

Wheat requires warehouses, packaging, transportation, harvesting, quality control, and distribution networks to ensure its usability. Dollars require assessing creditworthiness, drafting loan contracts, securing collateral, regulating banks, and enforcing debt repayment. All of these processes exist because assets must be carefully managed.

But crypto has none of this. There is no collateral to manage, no contracts to enforce, and no tangible good or service behind it. All it does is track numbers. And tracking numbers is easy.

The fun fact about crypto is this: holders believe they own something, but in reality, they own nothing. They hold numbers but possess no assets, no store of value, and certainly no money or currency, since those are types of assets.

No matter how much crypto advocates argue about scarcity, decentralization, or belief-driven value, the fundamental fact remains: they hold numbers but own nothing. Crypto is merely a system that tracks numbers assigned to addresses, with no real-world connection to tangible needs or value. Strip away the collective belief, and what remains is just a digital record stating, ""This address has this number."" Beyond that, there is nothing - no ownership, no stored value, just numbers in a ledger telling holders their stake in empty bags.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

I started coinbase a month ago, and have lost about 2 grands.

I clicked on 'all' or '1Y' tab, since I only joined a month ago, I expect the numbers to be exactly the same - but in fact it showed more unrealized return on 1Y tab (1k++) vs All tab (800++ as you can see in screenshot).

Also, I have actually lost 2 grands - I have done a few trades, was down like 5 grands or something initially but managed to close the gap a little.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Trouble using WhatToMine for hobby mining,2025-02-09 12:16:31,"I have a halfway decent rig (5950x and 6900xt) at home that's unused as I'm out of the country long term. I was thinking of repurposing it to try mining some altcoins. I'm not expecting to get rich, but it would be cool to make a little profit after electricity costs, and most importantly I think I'd enjoy it as a hobby. I can SSH in while I'm away and tweak it easily too.

I was using ChatGPT (4o) to do some calculations, and was pretty thrilled to see I could make a few $ mining KAS and ERG. I then found the site WhatToMine, but I think I'm doing something wrong. 

It's showing net profit in the negative for every coin. I tried putting in a 4090 instead of my 6900xt, same thing. At $0.14/kWh, the best I can do apparently is ALEO, losing -$0.01. I did notice that it doesn't seem to include a lot of altcoins, but it does have ERG, claiming a -$0.91 loss. ChatGPT spits out this:

""The **daily net profit** for a **6900 XT mining Ergo (ERG)** at **$0.14/kWh** is approximately **$3.56/day**.​""

Am I overlooking anything in WhatToMine, or should I just move on to another hobby (even if I went out and bought 2x4090's, which apparently will lose money too)?

If it helps, here's how I have it set up currently (6900xt + 4090 as I was thinking of getting a 4090):

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin's mempool cleared for first time since Jan 2023, sparking concerns of long-term security budget sustainability",2025-02-08 19:08:12,"**TL;DR**:

Last week, Bitcoin's mempool dropped to 0 vBytes, making it the first time this happened since Jan 2023. It means there is little demand for on-chain Bitcoin transactions.

On the positive side, Bitcoin fees are at the lowest they've been in years. On the negative side, this usually only happens during **bear markets**, and it shows that Bitcoin's **security budget is not sustainable** when the block subsidy is gone. Mining revenue collapses 10-100x whenever this happens, and revenue becomes extremely unstable.

For the past 2 years, Ordinals and Inscriptions have dominated activity, giving hope that Bitcoin's security budget could be sustained in the long run after the block subsidy programmatically collapse. But even Ordinals activity has dropped considerably recently as people flee away from memecoins.

> Overall, the mempool clearing coupled with transaction fees being stagnant is a reminder that Bitcoin mining needs Bitcoin to evolve into a robust platform for mining to remain a profitable business.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,... Is it over?,2025-02-10 02:37:26,"Just curious what the general opinion is now. I'm getting the sinking feeling that this is my final window to take profits unless I want to wait another 4 years. I've brushed off every dip towards 100k, but after the stagnation and seeing it start to slip, it feels off. I felt as though we were still in for another pump to 120k at least, and that was the point I'd cash out. But its just hit this wall right before the mark I chose to take profits at. Am I just being weak? I'm aware a lot of this is ""I feel"" and not price graphs or data analysis, I'm more curious about the overall sentiment. The more it flatlines and slowly falls, the more I think I'm in the late game and its now or wait 4 years again.

One thing that keeps me holding still is the fact that large firms and whales are still buying up all they can as of very recently, leading me to take a sheep mentality since they clearly think there's more room to gain so I should hold out too. ",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010
Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

You could prove the inputs for each iteration of the loop outputs the inputs for the next iteration of the loop. This is highly parallelisable and the polynomials involved would be tiny making inversion steps much simpler.

You would then need some way to succinctly aggregate all those mini proofs.

Is this pure silliness or might there be something here?

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

Reddit,crypto,Is there a name for this ‘inverse MOV’ attack and does it work in specialised cases?,2025-01-09 11:41:49,"The MOV attack works by choosing an elliptic curve with a small embedding degree then using a Tate pairing to map from the curve to a finite field, where the discrete log is sub-exponential.

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,Hashing conundrums,2024-12-20 20:49:23,"I have two questions about hashing that I thought might as well be merged into one post.

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

Are there any standard actually proper ways of doing something like this?",2025-02-11 00:52:33.334010

I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?
