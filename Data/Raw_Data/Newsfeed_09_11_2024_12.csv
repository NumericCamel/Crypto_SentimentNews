As Kenobi says, every downtrend is retreating in duration, which in turn means that the bears may exhaust themselves, and it could clear the way for a recovery. The #DOGE bear market consisted of three major downtrend cycles. Whether it’s a coincidence or not, the first cycle lasted 540 days, nearly 1.5 years; the second lasted 364 days, exactly one year; and we are now concluding the third downtrend cycle, which lasted approximately 182… pic.twitter.com/GToZmRaPCh — Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) September 9, 2024 He explained that the initial downtrend lasted 540 days, or approximately 1.5 years while the second cycle was 364 days. Against these, he said, the ongoing downtrend has seen only 182 days, or roughly six months. As a matter of fact, the compressing length of such cycles could be seen as a signal for a momentum shift, setting things up for a likely bull run. Dogecoin Price Action Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.1003, up 6% in the last seven days. The price had bounced off a support line of $0.089 and a bullish falling wedge pattern on DOGE’s daily chart has been identified. Dogecoin’s price would rapidly shoot to $0.15 if it maintains the level above $0.10, the chart suggests. Fear And Market Sentiment Despite the recent upward movement, market sentiment still lies in fear. The Fear & Greed Index stands at 33 for now and illustrates the amount of fear investors have. This, despite the performance of Dogecoin in the last 30 days, which stood at 15 green days up. The price movements of DOGE, on the other hand, usually come pretty stable as the positivity rate stood at 50%. Volatility remains very low, standing at 4.38%. While stability can be reassuring, it also suggests that DOGE lacks the momentum for a major breakout. Mixed signals in the market have made investors wary of taking any particular call. Investors seem to be performing a balancing act between short-term optimism and longer-term risks. The low volatility and an equal number of green days signal consolidation without showing any reversal signals.

According to CoinCodex, this cryptocurrency might fall 13.78%, putting Dogecoin at $0.088742 by October 2024. The above forecast really conflicts with the current bullish momentum of this token. Dogecoin is, therefore, at a crossroads. While the short-term indications may suggest some bullish momentum, technical indicators and recent price action indeed support a plausible rally for the meme crypto. But until then, the bearish long-term forecast continues with ongoing market fear; it would be best to exercise caution. Investors will do well by keeping a close eye on the short-term price action and broader market development before making serious moves.

According to a top data analyst, both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) could see astronomical increases of up to 18,887% if Bitcoin reaches the predicted price of $110,000. With Bitcoin acting as the backbone of the crypto market, altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are expected to ride the wave of momentum, offering incredible gains for investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Moves Beyond Meme Status Originally launched as a meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has grown far beyond its initial conception. Once considered a simple “Dogecoin killer,” Shiba Inu has transformed into a multifaceted cryptocurrency ecosystem, featuring developments that attract serious attention from both developers and investors. With the introduction of Shibarium, ShibaSwap 2.0, and the Shiba Inu Metaverse, the token now offers a range of utility-based services that distance it from its meme coin origins. The year 2024 has been pivotal for Shiba Inu (SHIB), as its developer activity has reached new heights. Recent advancements on the Shibarium platform have pushed the project into the spotlight, with more smart contracts being deployed and developer engagement hitting a three-month high. These developments are reshaping the future of Shiba Inu (SHIB), making it one of the most promising altcoins in the market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) Gains From Bitcoin Price Rise With Bitcoin’s potential rise to $110,000 looming, the spillover effect on altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) is anticipated to be massive. Historically, Bitcoin’s upward movements have had a positive impact on the wider crypto market, pushing up altcoin prices as investor sentiment improves. Shiba Inu (SHIB), with its ecosystem growing rapidly, stands to gain significantly from a Bitcoin rally. Its developer community is actively enhancing its utility, and platforms like Shibarium are making it easier for investors to use Shiba Inu (SHIB) in real-world applications. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, is attracting attention due to its unique approach. As the first Play 2 Date cryptocurrency, it combines social engagement with financial rewards, allowing users to earn tokens by participating in virtual dating activities. The coin has surged by 187% during its presale phase, and it’s expected to keep climbing as the demand for this innovative blend of social engagement and cryptocurrency grows. Investors are drawn to GoodEgg (GEGG) because it offers a mix of fun and utility, unlike traditional meme coins. Early Investors Win Big from Early Adoptions of Meme Coin Pre-sales play a critical role in the success of emerging crypto projects, offering early investors the opportunity to get in at the ground level before the tokens are released to the public. In 2024, pre-sales are drawing significant attention, with projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB), VeChain, and Artemis demonstrating the potential for high returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has used its pre-sales and early offerings to build a strong foundation for growth, moving beyond its meme status to become a serious contender in the altcoin space. Similarly, GoodEgg (GEGG) has used its presale to generate significant interest, selling over 2.4 billion tokens at the attractive price of $0.00015. With a 15% bonus on all purchases, early investors are taking advantage of the opportunity to be part of a project that merges entertainment with the financial incentives of cryptocurrency. The success of GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale is a testament to the growing appeal of hybrid crypto models that combine real-world applications with digital rewards. Analyst Predict Unprecedented Gains For Alt Coins As Bitcoin edges closer to the $110,000 mark, analysts are predicting that altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) could see their values skyrocket. The forecasted 18,887% surge for these coins is tied directly to the broader market sentiment, which tends to follow Bitcoin’s trajectory. Shiba Inu (SHIB), with its rapidly expanding ecosystem and increased developer activity, is well-positioned to capitalize on the bullish market. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG)continues to capture the market’s attention through its innovative Play 2 Date model, making it an attractive option for investors looking for long-term gains in the meme coin space. Its combination of social engagement and cryptocurrency rewards offers something new and exciting, and with the current presale pricing, it’s clear that investors are eager to be part of the next big thing in crypto. Overall Anaylsis: With Bitcoin predicted to hit $110,000, the ripple effect across the crypto market could see altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) experience unprecedented gains.

As part of its Play 2 Date presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) is drawing significant attention, particularly from Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders who are looking for new and innovative opportunities after seeing the potential for explosive growth. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Launches New Staking Opportunity with K9 Finance For the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, the recent launch of the K9 Finance Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) platform has created a lot of excitement. Set to go live on September 18th, this new platform allows current BONE token holders to stake their tokens and receive rewards in return. Unlike traditional staking methods, investors have the flexibility to exchange their staked BONE for knBONE, a liquid token that enhances usability within the Shibarium ecosystem. This is a major development for Shiba Inu (SHIB), as it offers new ways to increase value while improving security. The platform’s successful smart contract audit has reassured the community about its safety, further boosting confidence in the Shibarium ecosystem. From Unknown to Unstoppable: Why Shiba Inu Holders Are Looking at GoodEgg (GEGG) As Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders look for new opportunities, GoodEgg (GEGG) has presented itself as an attractive option. The Play 2 Date model combines the fun of virtual dating with cryptocurrency rewards, allowing users to earn tokens for participating in social activities. With over 2.4 billion GoodEgg (GEGG) tokens sold in its presale and a 15% bonus on all purchases, the project has caught the attention of investors. The presale phase of GoodEgg (GEGG) has been highly successful, and its innovative approach has helped it stand out in the crowded meme coin space. This surge in popularity is fueled by its gamified features, where users can unlock NFTs, gain levels in the dating platform, and earn rewards—all while participating in a socially driven ecosystem. For Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors, who have long been part of a strong community focused on building utility beyond meme coin hype, the promise of a similar approach with GoodEgg (GEGG) is appealing. Many Shiba Inu (SHIB)holders are seeking projects with long-term growth potential and practical use cases, which GoodEgg (GEGG) delivers with its combination of entertainment and financial incentives. Social-Based Crypto Platform Leads Trend with Play-2-Date innovation The introduction of social-based crypto platforms like GoodEgg (GEGG) reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where users are increasingly seeking more interactive and engaging ways to earn tokens. The concept of Play 2 Date is an evolution of the Play 2 Earn model, adding a layer of social interaction to the already successful play-and-earn concept. This shift is attracting a wide variety of investors, from retail traders to larger whales, including those holding Shiba Inu (SHIB). Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is continuing its own evolution, moving beyond its meme coin roots and into more utility-driven platforms. With the new developments from K9 Finance and the increasing functionality of the Shibarium ecosystem, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is positioning itself for long-term sustainability. This has led many Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders to also take notice of GoodEgg (GEGG), seeing it as a similar project that has the potential to combine fun with meaningful financial returns. K9 Finance and GoodEgg (GEGG) Unlock Robust Ecosystems As K9 Finance launches its new staking platform, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is set to see an increase in its total value locked (TVL), which could stabilize prices and further strengthen the community’s confidence. The Shibarium ecosystem is expected to benefit from a boost in engagement and financial inflows, thanks to the flexibility and security offered by the new staking derivative platform. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to onboard investors, particularly from the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, who are eager to explore this innovative project.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,New Dogecoin Rival Creates Cryptocurrency With ‘Social Scoring System’ Currently Priced at $0.00015,2024-09-11 10:53:16+00:00,"The meme coin world is buzzing with the emergence of GoodEgg (GEGG), a new cryptocurrency that combines meme coin energy with real-world utility through a unique “social scoring system.” Priced at $0.00015 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly gaining traction, positioning itself as a formidable rival to Dogecoin (DOGE). While Dogecoin continues to focus on scalability and business adoption through its ambitious trailmap, GoodEgg (GEGG) is capturing the attention of crypto investors looking for something more than just a meme. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Trailmap to Increase Adoption Rate The Dogecoin Foundation has made significant progress on its trailmap, with the completion of 100% of its first phase and 90% of its second phase. This development is focused on breaking down barriers to adoption for businesses and making Dogecoin (DOGE) a more viable currency for everyday transactions. Key elements include the GigaWallet, which simplifies Dogecoin (DOGE) integration for companies, and LibDogecoin, which makes it easier for developers to build on the Dogecoin (DOGE) blockchain. These projects are part of a broader effort to scale Dogecoin (DOGE), including the introduction of Project Sakura, which aims to increase Dogecoin’s (DOGE) block speed and size by tenfold. This could significantly improve Dogecoin’s (DOGE) scalability, making it more efficient for processing transactions without compromising its decentralized nature. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen widespread attention, particularly after Elon Musk’s continued endorsements, the market is starting to recognize GoodEgg (GEGG) as a viable competitor that brings new features to the meme coin space. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Hottest Meme Coin Right Now Unlike many meme coins that exist solely for speculative trading, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a more robust framework, integrating a “social scoring system” within its ecosystem. Users can earn rewards based on their engagement, social interactions, and contributions within the community. This system aligns with the Social-Fi trend, where digital assets are earned through social behaviors, not just financial transactions. Priced at $0.00015 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG has already sold over 2.4 billion tokens, with strong interest from early investors. By introducing a “social scoring system,” GoodEgg (GEGG) taps into the growing demand for utility-based meme coins, offering real-world applications alongside the fun of earning tokens through social engagement. Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors Are Interested in GoodEgg (GEGG) While Dogecoin (DOGE) is busy focusing on improving its infrastructure with projects like GigaWallet and Project Sakura, a portion of its community has started looking at GoodEgg (GEGG) as a new frontier for meme coins with real utility. The social scoring system introduced by GoodEgg (GEGG) offers users tangible rewards for their interactions within the platform, providing both fun and financial incentives. This is why Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are showing interest in GoodEgg (GEGG). With its emphasis on creating a socially driven ecosystem, GoodEgg (GEGG offers a different value proposition, appealing to those looking for long-term opportunities in the meme coin market. Dogecoin (DOGE) and GoodEgg (GEGG): Complementary Forces? Although Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the dominant meme coin, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a complementary player with a focus on social engagement and reward systems. While Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Project Sakura aims to increase its transaction speed and scalability, GoodEgg (GEGG) is leveraging the growing interest in social interactions within the crypto space. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) infrastructure projects, including LibDogecoin and GigaWallet, aim to make DOGE a viable payment solution for businesses and individuals. However, GoodEgg (GEGG) is carving out its niche by focusing on the Social-Fi movement, providing users with more than just a financial incentive to hold and trade the token. This dual approach—meme coin fun paired with real-world utility—offers a fresh take on what meme coins can achieve. The Future Looks Promising for GoodEgg (GEGG) With a clear roadmap that includes the development of a full-scale dating platform, staking mechanisms, and a wider pool of NFTs, GoodEgg (GEGG is more than just another meme coin. The token’s price of $0.00015 during presale is a reflection of the strong interest it has garnered from investors, including those who have previously backed Dogecoin (DOGE). As the GoodEgg (GEGG) presale progresses, the token is set to become a major player in the meme coin ecosystem, especially with its focus on creating a rewarding social experience for users. The combination of entertainment, engagement, and financial reward gives GoodEgg (GEGG) an edge over traditional meme coins, attracting a broad spectrum of investors. Final Thoughts: GoodEgg (GEGG) as a New Meme Coin Challenger While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to develop its infrastructure and aims for greater scalability with Project Sakura, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a challenger in the meme coin space with its innovative “social scoring system.” Priced attractively at $0.00015 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) has captured the attention of Dogecoin (DOGE)investors and new entrants to the crypto market. As both projects continue to develop, the rivalry between Dogecoin (DOGE) and GoodEgg (GEGG may push the boundaries of what meme coins can offer, ultimately benefiting investors who are looking for both fun and utility in the crypto space.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Dogecoin 1.79% Slow Movement Keeps Holders In Suspense, GoogEgg (GEGG) Becomes Crypto’s Favorite Meme",2024-09-11 10:50:40+00:00,"In the rapidly shifting cryptocurrency market, meme coins have a unique ability to capture investor interest, often riding waves of sentiment and social media buzz. Dogecoin has long been the leader of this movement, but with its recent slow growth of 1.79%, investors are left wondering what comes next. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG), the first Social-Fi dating coin, is quickly becoming a favorite in the meme coin sector, drawing attention with its unique virtual dating ecosystem and strong community support. Dogecoin’s Recent Performance: Slower but Steady In the past few days, Dogecoin (DOGE) has maintained a slower upward trajectory, with a 1.79% increase. While this movement is modest compared to previous explosive growth, it still places Dogecoin (DOGE) among the top-performing meme coins. This steady rise can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a broader market uplift driven by Bitcoin and a tweet from Elon Musk. The tweet, which featured Musk behind a sign reading “D.O.G.E.” for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” once again fueled speculation around Dogecoin (DOGE) and its potential for further growth. As a result, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw an influx of investments, with data showing an 800% increase in net inflows. The token’s price jumped from $0.089 to $0.1036, a notable 16% rise. However, many investors are cautious, wondering whether Dogecoin (DOGE) can sustain this momentum, especially given Musk-related price movements’ history of being short-lived. GoodEgg (GEGG): A Meme Coin with Social-Fi Utility While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold its position as a top meme coin, GoodEgg (GEGG) has emerged as a promising alternative. GoodEgg (GEGG) stands out by offering more than just speculative gains—it combines the playful nature of meme coins with the utility of a virtual dating platform. With its Social-Fi approach, users can earn $GEGG tokens by participating in dating activities, unlocking NFTs, and progressing through levels in a gamified experience. GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly gained a dedicated community, and its presale has seen strong interest, with over 2.4 billion $GEGG tokens sold at the current price of 0.00015 USDT. Investors are also taking advantage of a 15% bonus on all purchases, further boosting the project’s growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers real-world utility through its dating platform, making it a favorite among those looking for long-term gains in the meme coin space. A Unique Ecosystem for Long-Term Success What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from other meme coins is its well-rounded ecosystem, which is designed to offer a sustainable and rewarding experience for its users. With a roadmap that includes the launch of a full-fledged dating platform, gamified features, and a secure environment backed by blockchain technology, GoodEgg aims to redefine how people interact both socially and financially. The $GEGG token is built on the Ethereum (ERC20) network, making it highly accessible and scalable. The project’s developers have ensured that the platform is secure and transparent, with audits from leading security firms to bolster investor confidence. As the platform grows, users will not only enjoy its social benefits but also capitalize on the financial opportunities presented by staking, governance participation, and earning rewards through in-game achievements. By merging real-world social interaction with the benefits of cryptocurrency, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the meme coin space, offering both fun and long-term value. Can Musk’s influence out pace the current bearish market? Despite its slow movement, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a critical player in the meme coin ecosystem. Its rise has often paved the way for other meme coins to thrive, and this time is no different. In the wake of Dogecoin (DOGE)’s modest rise, the entire meme coin market has seen an influx of investment. The total market capitalization of meme tokens grew from $34.91 billion to $38.84 billion, largely driven by Dogecoin (DOGE) and other rising tokens. However, questions remain about how long this bullish sentiment will last. Historically, trends driven by Elon Musk’s tweets tend to be short-lived, leading some investors to search for new projects with lasting potential. GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to capture this interest, especially as investors look for meme coins with utility beyond short-term price spikes. The Future of GoodEgg and Dogecoin As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues its slow and steady rise, many investors are keeping an eye on whether it can break through key resistance levels. Currently trading around $0.1036, Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching critical points that could trigger further price movements. If the token surpasses the $0.111 resistance level, it could spark a rally toward $0.142 or even $0.175, marking a significant recovery for the meme coin. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) is gaining momentum as the first Social-Fi dating coin, blending cryptocurrency with real-world connections. With plans to release its full dating platform in the coming phases of its roadmap, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique opportunity for investors who want more than just a fun meme coin. The token’s combination of social impact and virtual dating provides a fresh angle in the meme coin space, setting it apart from traditional meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE). For those looking to get in early, GoodEgg (GEGG)‘s presale is live, and the project is attracting attention from across the crypto community. As both Dogecoin (DOGE) and GoodEgg (GEGG) continue to evolve, investors will be watching closely to see which coin leads the next big movement in the meme coin sector. In conclusion, while Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 1.79% slow movement keeps its holders in suspense, GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly become a favorite meme coin, offering a unique blend of social interaction and crypto rewards. Both tokens are worth keeping an eye on as they continue to shape the future of the meme coin market.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-19 20:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

I got 3 SOL transfered to my MagicEden wallet from this address: EKzvtG6qi9NCBh9TsB1oHjGG4E7woeZz63vLxy727GbZ

Is it a scam? If yes, how does it work?

I had only few SOL and free NFT mints from MagicEden on the wallet. Is that an airdrop from MagicEden?

Thanks!

Reddit,solana,I can't wrap my head around this whole rent thing.,2024-09-11 08:12:03,"I only started using solana a few days ago, I'm developing a bot which accepts payments from different users. For that I use the solana rpc.

So a user can join a ""list"" (by some sort of cmd) and he then gets an address where he can send money to. Each user has his own address, this is to keep track of everything and keep it organized. Now, the problem I had when sending transactions on the devnet is, that these new empty accounts need to have some funds at first so they can accept new funds from the user. As far as I understood this is for the rent.

>Transaction results in an account (1) with insufficient funds for rent

But why can't this rent be taken from the first transaction the user makes to that address? Why does it need funds prior to that? I fixed it by using an airdrop, but since I'm only on the devnet I'm unsure if this will even work on the mainnet.

I'd appreciate some guidance if some of you are experienced with this kind of problem.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,solana,Crypto Solana portfolio management: balancing risk and reward,2024-09-10 23:24:15,"Managing a Solana portfolio requires a careful balance between risk and reward (profits you want and losses you can afford). Many investors struggle with maintaining this balance, often due to a lack of risk management strategies and knowledge.

Here are key pointers for effective cryptocurrency portfolio management:

1. **Diversification across cryptos:** While major players like Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin are common, consider including promising altcoins/memecoins to spread risk or even to optimize upsides.
2. **Market volatility and regulations:** Staying informed about market trends and regulations is relatively easy considering a small change can heavily impact your portfolio performance, you don’t want to be late on the big news when they happen.
3. **Setting clear goals:** You need short-term and long-term plans. Focus on strategic growth and keep track of your gains with a real possible plan to get there. Betting on luck is not enough to stay aligned with your investment objectives.
4. **Rebalancing your portfolio:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain the level of risk and reward you think is okay.
5. **Risk strategy**: Have a good risk strategy to compensate for high fluctuations and unexpected events, as crypto is mostly about those two types of events. Successful traders excel at predicting the unpredictable, which is different from traditional stock investing.
6. **Take profits and cut losses:** Don’t stay too long in a position when you’ve hit your target or your limit, remember the long-term game!
7. **Market caps variety**: Invest in a mix of large, mid, and small-cap cryptocurrencies depending on your strategy and expectations. Consulting successful traders can guide you towards what kind of market caps you should look at based on your objectives.
8. **Asset variety**: NFTs and DeFi staking can be considered for Solana traders to diversify your portfolio, yet consider how the macro trends impact the volume and performance of NFTs versus tokens.

Careful planning is always key.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-10 14:08:52,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057
Reddit,solana,What is a smart contract? How do they work? What are they good for ??,2024-09-10 17:41:28,"A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties in the form of computer code. The contracts are stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed. Transactions that take place in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without the intervention of a third party. When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

Reddit,solana,Spot breakout patterns: a guide for Solana crypto smart traders,2024-09-10 15:33:58,"Trading crypto on Solana is complex, so understanding breakout patterns can be valuable info for smart traders. A breakout occurs when a crypto’s price moves beyond a defined support or resistance level, it can be a potential shift in the market trends.

Here are some key breakout patterns that can assist crypto traders:

* **Avoid weak breakouts:** Weak breakouts may lack the volume necessary to sustain momentum, leading to false signals. Always ensure that a breakout is supported by significant trading volume to confirm its strength.
* **Continuation breakouts:** These occur when the price breaks in the direction of the prevailing trend. They are useful for confirming a trend change. Continuation breakouts often signal that the current trend will persist, providing opportunities for traders to enter or exit positions strategically.
* **Reversal breakouts:** Reversal breakouts happen when a price trend changes direction, either from an uptrend to a downtrend or vice versa. It's crucial to analyze the current trends and determine which are reaching their peak or bottom levels to identify potential reversal points.

Using tools like trading signals can further help in taking fast decisions to find and time these breakouts more easily.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,solana,Technical analysis for smart Solana crypto trading,2024-09-09 22:13:28,"Here are the essential knowledge about effective TA and indicators to improve your strategies on Solana:

# Price charts and candlesticks

Get familiar with price charts and candlestick patterns to start understanding how successful traders read price action. It’s essential for identifying the latest trends and potential reversals in the price actions. Candlestick patterns offer some level of insights.

# Support and resistance levels

Good entry and exit strategies can come from understanding how support and resistance works. Support levels indicate where a cryptocurrency's price might find a “floor”, while resistance levels show where upward price movements “could” stall. Breakouts can be faked, and they can tell that something big is coming too.

# Basic key indicators for smart trading

* **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Spot changes in market direction over time.
* **Volume Analysis:** Track trading volumes to confirm trends and trading signals. High trading volumes can indicate strong interest in a particular direction, but pay caution as these can be manipulated by scammers.

Remember, while these indicators can guide your decisions, they do not guarantee success. Adapt fast to what works best!",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Including all the token names and transaction date/times?   The info appears clearly in the transaction hash details.  Does Solflare have a usable download button?  I only see the history page with no DL option.  Printing the PDF of that page failed.

I've downloaded the SOL and the SPL files from Solscan but they are not something you can follow easily and they don't include time or token names.  The individual transx hash have all the info, so it seems it should be easy to extract a summary for each transx. of all time without doing it manually.

I'm trying to do taxes and reconcile 1,000+ Solana transactions which were done using Solflare+ Ledger together.  99% are scam airdrops.  Ledger is useless as most transactions don't show in it's transaction history.

I'm using Cointracking..info  Solana address upload, which makes it pretty easy to sift through, but you're still left with a bunch of ""transfers"" which must be converted to swaps to establish cost basis. I want to make sure everything is done correctly.

Any suggestions on how to do this?   Generally, you would take any transactions with the same time stamp and merge them, but with all that info in Solscan I don't know why I'm doing it manually.   My next step was going to be to download the Cointracking transaction file and merge the dep/withdraws of same time stamp into ""trades"".  I'm hoping there is a shortcut.

Reddit,solana,Why auto downloads are risky on Solana,2024-09-09 01:53:55,"No wallet, no way to interact with the blockchain or with an exchange (CEX or DEX). Imagine if simply downloading an image can drain your crypto wallet?

Automatic downloads on messaging apps can compromise your private keys and drain your crypto wallets if they contain malicious code. They can also expose your device to malware. By avoiding auto-downloads, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and hackers.

Phishing attacks pose another threat to your crypto journey. Cybercriminals create fake sites and apps that mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Auto-downloads can install these malicious apps, compromising your wallet. Verify the authenticity of any site or app before downloading and disable auto-downloads on all devices.

# How to protect your crypto wallet

1. **Disable auto-downloads on all devices and applications:** Do not skip this step!
2. **Use a hardware wallet:** For optimal security, store your private keys offline with a hardware wallet. A small step to protect a bit more against online threats.
3. **Choose reputable crypto exchanges:** Research every platform before selecting an exchange (both CEX and DEX) that you like, some have a bigger history of losing customer funds than others.
4. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):** Improve your crypto wallet security with 2FA or MFA whenever its possible, why not?

I tend to see a lot of Discord communities emerge for projects on Solana. I have personally also been involved with Discord crypto communities since a long time ago and I also have some experience building Discord bots.

As part of the recent [Blinkathon](https://blinkathon.fun) hackathon I have built the [Blinkord](https://blinkord.com) platform - Solana Blinks meet Discord. It's a platform where Discord server owners can create their own shareable link and enable their community members to gain access to paid/exclusive content in only a few clicks and through Solana's Blinks, which can be done from anywhere.

The point of Blinkord is to replace the need for using centralized platforms to offer premium content on Discord and make it very easy for the community members to obtain exclusive roles which grant them access, highly increasing the conversion rate for the purchases.

It is currently in the MVP phase and I am trying to get as much feedback as possible to validate my idea and also to see if there is enough demand from Discord server admins or mods to use such a tool to offer premium content to their community members.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback and would love to hear your thoughts, thanks!!

Reddit,solana,URL previews and verifying links before clicking for Solana crypto safety,2024-09-07 14:17:56,"Solana trading is already risky enough as our asset class is very speculative and high in movement, the worst would be to also fall victim to scams due to a lack of attention to security. 

A simple way to avoid getting scammed is to be very cautious about the links you click. The basis of scams in crypto is often designed to exploit your desire for a quick buck and carelessness.

To avoid significant financial losses, pay attention for a few minutes and keep your wallet intact by being vigilant and taking proactive steps.



Here's a guide to help you protect yourself with unknown links:

**Unknown links are not your friends**

Your favorite and other known trading crypto bots are often impersonated by fake bots. If you don’t double-check the right link/username for a trading bot, you’re likely to send your funds somewhere that doesn’t belong to you, or at least with the capacity to return these assets back to yourself. 

Avoid clicking on every link you come across, as doing so could lead to your personal information being compromised or even your computer being infiltrated with malware. With one click, a ton can happen. Do not underestimate the impact of one click. Prioritize security to protect your investments above all.



**Using token scanners and explorers**

To verify the legitimacy of a token and its official links, use tools like token sniffers and blockchain explorers to preview the legit URLs, allowing you to trade the right smart contract and follow the right social media profiles.



**CEXs and DEXs can be impersonated too**

Even if you have used a platform a thousand times, make sure to bookmark the legit URLs of the platforms you use to avoid ever giving your login information to a fake website pretending to be the exchange you use. Bookmarking URLs is an easy practice to keep you safe.

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Reddit,ethereum,Wallet Drainer... is there any way to get out of it?,2024-09-08 09:06:38,"Some time in the past I was apparently stupid in dabbling with everything Defi old and new and at some point I approved a drainer contract on my ETH account on Ledger. Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

I recently got a Trezor and want to self custody funds, however I'd also like to convert to rETH to get some APY. I've been doing some research and learning the basics, though there is a lot of info to take in here and trying to figure out what's best, and how to not accidentally screw myself and lose any coin in the process.



Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?

Reddit,ethereum,Why Aren't There More Junior Smart Contract Developer Positions? ,2024-09-05 19:53:59,"
I'm curious about why there seem to be so few opportunities for junior smart contract developers.

I understand that smart contract development requires a solid understanding of blockchain and security pitfalls, but if companies aren't offering junior roles, how are developers supposed to gain that experience?

I've been searching for opportunities for the last 2 months, but there are literally zero openings for entry-level positions. 

Most of the companies are asking for 5 years of experience in blockchain and 5 years in front-end development.

How can people who are just starting to learn this technology stay motivated if there are no opportunities to break into the field?

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 13:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Im new to crypto but believe in this project for the long term. Therefore I want to send my ETH funds from my kraken wallet to a wallet where i can stake it - also for long term!
I prefer an iphone app wallet as im using that for now for my other smaller investments - for now. Till i have more invested, then i’ll go off line and get a ledger. (Broke ass student lol)

Reddit,ethereum,DCA Out Question,2024-08-25 14:02:17,"As the title states, i'm curious whether DCA'ing out some of my ETH is feasible and how it'll impact my portfolio in the future when ETH blows up.

I currently hold ( Amount) in ETH with an average cost of $2340. I've run into some financial issues (layoff/exhausted unemployment) and am hoping to liquidate some of my holdings to sustain myself and my family.

My question is, if I hypothetically sold $1000 profit per withdrawal and left my principal deposit dollar amount untouched, is this a smart tactic for DCA'ing out? Also, will withdrawing $1000 per transaction increase my future cost average as well? Will this reduce my profit margins in the future as my quantity of ETH ownership decreases?

I realize the quantity of ETH that I own will get smaller but as long as the market value continues to increase, I should hypothetically be able to keep DCA'ing out profit, if needed?

At the end of the day, i'm a firm believer in ETH and am extremely bullish. My goal is to maintain my principal deposit amount but only pull profits.
Please let me know if i'm headed in the wrong direction here or may be looking at this process the wrong way.

Thanks in advance for your time!",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,ethereum,"Help Needed: Ethereum HSM Integration Resulting in ""Invalid Sender"" Error",2024-08-19 20:33:43,"**TL;DR:** Integrating HSM to sign Ethereum transactions but getting ""Invalid Sender"" errors despite correct address recovery and signature application. Need help troubleshooting the issue.  
I am trying to implement wallet generation and signing using an HSM.  I'm currently developing against SoftHSM2, with C#.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm running into troubles with ""Invalid Sender""

Hey Ethereum Devs,

I'm currently working on integrating a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to sign Ethereum transactions, and I've run into a persistent ""Invalid Sender"" error that I can't seem to resolve. I’m hoping the community might have some insights or suggestions.

# Background:

I'm using an HSM to securely generate and store Ethereum keys, and then to sign transactions. The process involves retrieving the public and private keys from the HSM, creating a transaction, signing it, and then sending it to the Ethereum network.

Here’s a summary of the workflow:

1. **Retrieve Public Key Info:** I retrieve the public key and its associated label from the HSM based on the Ethereum address.
2. **Generate Transaction Hash:** I use the `Sha3Keccack` hash function to create a message hash from the public key.
3. **Initial Signature:** I generate an initial signature with the retrieved private key using the message hash.
4. **Create Transaction:** I build a `LegacyTransaction` object with the transaction parameters like nonce, gas price, gas limit, etc.
5. **Recompute Transaction Hash:** The transaction hash is recomputed, including the Chain ID to ensure EIP-155 compliance.
6. **Final Signature:** I generate the final signature with the recomputed transaction hash.
7. **Adjust V for EIP-155:** The `V` value is adjusted as per EIP-155 (i.e., `V = finalSignature.V + Chain ID * 2 + 35`).
8. **Apply Final Signature:** I set the final signature on the transaction and serialize it.
9. **Send Transaction:** The serialized transaction is sent to the Ethereum network.

# The Problem:

Despite the transaction being created and signed correctly (as far as I can tell), when I submit it, I consistently get an ""Invalid Sender"" error.

# Debugging Data:

Here’s some of the debug output:

* **Public Key Info:** `Address=0xd2de6f19109d613f17496837e03909ad26632081`, `Label=test`
* **Message Hash:** `dd5e1cc957e9cf152b8e6d7ef12160622a31b329cad932d57998e9334ef0495a`
* **Initial Signature:** `R=0EE8B7B9FE8DAC6267ABADAA5F339D234A4B3CB4BAE4FC3BC31B619A8C726946F`, `S=641FEBC235A4EECA13597671AC5B1A32314D4DD07ABD84F074A93AAC674F77C2`, `V=28`
* **Recovered Address v27:** `0x0D9D930AC4Af2EdB21369c0A362F8c813264B85b`
* **Recovered Address v28:** `0xD2DE6F19109D613f17496837e03909aD26632081` (This is the correct one)
* **Transaction Hash:** `2f0028f56b6e1550d7a34e5da3048ef4ecda121004c38135f276ff7293a6e0db`
* **Final Signature:** `R=76AB822FD1B3D61C0C261B5FEEE33014F95EB658B93412FB8E2C8222C79CB91F`, `S=0811F55B97C7D97253CFD39B76B3A244C612BBEBB13BA76BD2160AFE6C6853FF9`, `V=141`

Despite the correct address being recovered with `V=28`, the transaction still results in an ""Invalid Sender"" error when the signed transaction is submitted.

# Code Snippet:

Here’s the critical part of the code where I believe the issue might be:

    csharpCopy codevar vValue = (byte)(finalSignature.V + _chainId * 2 + 35);
    transaction.SetSignature(new Signature
    {
        R = finalSignature.R,
        S = finalSignature.S,
        V = new byte[] { vValue }
    });
    var serializedTx = transaction.GetRLPEncoded().ToHex();

# What I’ve Tried:

* **Checked V Calculation:** Confirmed that the `V` value is calculated as per EIP-155.
* **Address Recovery:** Verified that the correct address is recovered with `V=28`.
* **Serialized Transaction:** Compared the serialized transaction output with a known good transaction; it looks correct.

# Community Help:

I'm stumped at this point. Does anyone have experience with HSMs and Ethereum transactions? Could it be an issue with the way I’m applying the signature or something subtle in the transaction serialization?

Any advice, suggestions, or pointers would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help! 🙏

Reddit,ethereum,The blobs progress over the past half-year,2024-08-16 16:24:18,"**Can you believe it’s already been 6 months since the Dencun upgrade and the launch of blobs?**

The Dencun upgrade brought us the much-anticipated blobs via EIP-4844, which have improved the Layer 2 users’ experience by making transactions cheaper and more efficient.

 Let’s take a moment to review the progress blobs have made over the past half-year:

* 2.3 million total blobs since the Dencun upgrade 
* 596,000 blocks containing blobs 
* 1.1 million blob transactions 

These numbers only scratch the surface of the significant impact blobs have had on the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing both efficiency and usability.

The momentum around blobs is growing, with more and more submitters joining in. We now have a robust ecosystem that includes Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Taiko, Scroll, Blast, Linea, Starknet, Zora, Zircuit, Kroma, and many more.

This growing network of L2s is making Ethereum more efficient, affordable, and driving innovation across all layers and dApps.

EIP-4844 also introduced a smart mechanism that adjusts the blob base fee according to supply and demand. Recently, we’ve seen the reaching the current target - 3 blobs per block. This dynamic fee model is designed to keep blob processing efficient and optimize block space.

🔗 Check out more details here: [dune.com/hildobby/blobs](http://dune.com/hildobby/blobs)

Before EIP-4844, there was a lot of uncertainty around pricing. But now, it’s clear that blobs have surpassed expectations. Comparing the cost of blobs to calldata on Rob's dashboard shows just how much cheaper blobs are.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,Here’s How Bitcoin Fixes Healthcare in America | NiHowdy 🤠,2024-09-10 21:46:00,"Hey Bitcoiners,

I wanted to share my thoughts on how Bitcoin can fix healthcare, especially in pharmacy. As a Pharmacist, I've seen firsthand the flaws in the drug industry that drive up costs unnecessarily. Here's why and how Bitcoin can help fix this.

I used to own a community pharmacy and often had customers who paid out of pocket because they lacked insurance. Even my patients with insurance had limited financial means. I felt it was right to offer medications at my cost or for free (if it was de minimus). However, I received notice from an insurance payor about clawing back funds because I provided walk-in customers a better price than the insurance company. I faced the tough decision of either paying this exorbitant clawback or being terminated from the network, which would prevent me from serving other patients.

From that day, I learned that pharmacies must bill retail pricing regardless of the customer. Pharmacies often enter into contracts with insurance companies that include a most favored nation clause, requiring insurance companies to receive the best price possible.

As a legal loophole, pharmacies use “discount cards” to offer discounted prices while complying with insurance payors. Most people don't realize these discount cards collect hefty commissions, up to 80% on the drugs you buy at the pharmacy, paid for by the consumer. Without these discount cards and contractual verbiage, prescriptions would be much cheaper. For instance, GoodRx makes over $500 million a year from this system, and even Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs uses a similar model. In my opinion, this is one of the largest rent-seeking industries in America. Last year, pharmacies spent over half a billion dollars on commissions, which highlights a huge inefficiency with prescription drugs.

In the 1990s, big retailers like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Target started $4 generic med programs to attract customers, which worked well. Insurance companies got upset about paying $40 for the same meds, leading to the implementation of the most favored nation clause among pharmacies. Since the 90s, the Prescription Discount Card industry has grown as meds get more expensive and insurance covers less. This messed-up system won't change, and government reform is unlikely.

[I got Bitcoin back at Rite-Aid!](https://preview.redd.it/iq2vus9sw1od1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e77d8fab8eaf2953e69bbd0a68a88ccb442aa2)

This led me to create [NiHowdy.com](http://NiHowdy.com) We're a prescription savings card that gives the same discounted prices as others but also returns the transaction fees and drug manufacture rebates to you. No one else in the industry does this. We can do it thanks to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

1. **Micro-transactions:** Bitcoin on the Lightning Network allows for high-volume micro-transactions, challenging the high fees from third-party companies. For example, we got a $10 drug for a customer and paid back a 3% rebate in Bitcoin—about 30 cents. You can't do that by mail since postage costs more. Electronic payments like PayPal need at least 30 cents to $1, plus a percentage, making drug rebates impossible. You can’t do shit with fiat.
2. **Zero Net Cost Drugs:** I’m preaching to the choir here but Bitcoin is an asset. There’s a finite number of Bitcoin, and growing global participation. I believe its value will rise in the future. With delayed gratification, Bitcoin’s value can offset prescription costs. Meanwhile, the U.S. government spends over $400 billion annually on prescription drugs, yet they aren’t free for everyone. Everyone pays into the system, but few benefit. We’ve been running NiHowdy as an MVP since 2022. Some early users have offset their prescription costs by 10% already.

I love Bitcoin. It has the power to change the world. I believe Bitcoin can solve out-of-pocket prescription costs—something our government can’t even solve. This ‘prescription discount card’ industry will sadly never die, but I think Bitcoin makes it more efficient for the end user/consumer.

If you or someone you know pays for prescriptions out of pocket in America, check out NiHowdy. We're releasing our second product, Meowdy, for pet prescriptions soon.

Thanks for reading. If you’re a Bitcoiner in healthcare, I’d love to connect. I often get ridiculed by healthcare providers for even talking about Bitcoin, but it brings me immense joy to find others who share the same enthusiasm. Shout out to my local Bitcoin group for encouraging me to post this on Reddit 😊

Cheers!

As an analogy, on Youtube you can see chemistry or physics demonstrations for entry level college students that ignite the imagination of the viewer, leaving them wondering “Hmm, why does it work that way?” Those who are inclined to learn more will be intrigued enough to learn more.

I feel that’s missing for bitcoin. Do you know of anything available, either online or in physical form? For the physical form, I was thinking of something like the board game of LIFE, that simulates the typical journey through life. 

I’d love to have some tangible product to help demonstrate the benefits of bitcoin.

Reddit,bitcoin,DCA+HODL only BTC is making more sense than ever when considering increasing global taxation. ,2024-09-10 13:19:52,"As governments all over the world move to endorse 'crypto"" and the industry through it's taxation... the bull case for just hodl'n **only** BTC gets stronger.

At first many governments and the mainstream financial world tried to FUD Bitcoin out of existence but of course that didn't work. The second phase is trying to stifle Bitcoin and the wider crypto sector through onerous legislation and increased taxation. 

When it comes to regulation as we know from the BTC ETFs Vs SEC, Bitcoin has again survived and thrived. Almost every government in the world has now fully endorsed Bitcoin through their taxation policies that surround it. In the aftermath of a global pandemic all governments are keener than ever to raise taxes to pay down budget deficits. However for most governments taxation hasn't only been restricted to just Bitcoin, rather all of crypto and it's industry. Historically governments have used long-term taxation to silently cripple things they don't want/ like in society. Over the years many have laid the foundation to do just that on crypto.. however once more BTC will not only survive...but thrive. 

There's a growing push by governments to ensure people are paying crypto taxes. Where years ago they silently laid the foundations for crypto tax legislation, these days they are getting increasingly vocal in pointing them out and enforcement. All the major exchanges have been visited by major global tax authorities and confirmed their intention to work with them and provide them information where requested. 

More crypto related tax compliance software exists than ever as do accountants selling crypto as a specialism. Be it losses or gains with the changing crypto tax landscape more individual investors than ever are being dragged into the need to report crypto taxes. Interestingly, those with messy portfolio's with thousands of altcoin transactions creating variable capital gains and losses and many with thousands of fragments of staking rewards will suffer the greatest financial burden/ stress.. enough to say.. f**k this, I'm going Bitcoin Maxi. 

For the most part as an easy to store,  highly divisible and liquid asset that for most typical users may only be likely to have to report on the odd capital gain.. Bitcoin is simple, effective and easy. Both as an asset and when it comes to tax. 

Real estate, Classic cars, precious metals etc ate often highly investable and make good stores of long-term value however Bitcoin is much more manageable. As capital gains tax across the world are increased HODL makes increasing sense. 

TL;DR

Dumping messy portfolio alts that onerous taxes may need reported on and avoiding investment in illiquid high maintenance assets when it comes to increasing global tax burdens means buying and hodling BTC is starting to make more sense than ever. 

Bitcoin maximalism has a very bright future. ",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,bitcoin,Couple questions-need advising,2024-09-10 19:37:23,"Ive trying to nail down a few things.  First, im broke.  So very sadly broke.  I only mention this because its a factor in my decisions. 

I would like to run a node.  For all the various reasons, one of which is to get a better understanding of the underpinnings of how BTC functions.  Hearing and reading is only taking me so far.  It would also be nice to verify transactions. 

Can i do this with just any machine with enough memory?  Will a raspberry pi work or an old phone or old laptop?  I understand theres a pruned down version, so is it necessary to have the whole history or just from the day you start and what gets loaded then? 

Next, cause im broke, i would like to mine.  I am stacking but my years are most likely less than the average weekly dca.  I obviously cant afford a rig but i can scrape couch change or sell plasma to get a bitaxe.  Yes i know thats like winning lotto, but i could also make a few pennies if i join a pool. Plus, again, ill be learning.  Very important. 

Lastly, my sidehustle ive been getting paid in paypal.  I really want to keep hodling but i also realize that its important to me, and some of us i imagine, to get the circular economy going and growing. I understand companies like zaprite are meant for businesses to facilitate exchange and conversion and accounting.  Im not sure this is something i need.  Ive got analysis paralysis when it comes to hot wallets and was just gonna pick one and wing it to get my feet wet.  Ive had proton mail for a few years and when i heard they are about to release a wallet as well as a bunch of other useful tools i was excited for that.  So my second question is, for a simple side gig wouldnt just accepting BTC with a wallet be sufficient? Or is there a smarter, safer, better way?  Also, am i being short sighted not accepting other crypto which will be a pain cause then ill need to run it thru an exchange to convert to BTC.  Maybe thats a bad idea.  Or what about lightning? Thats cheaper to transact and would that be easier to use as a payment from and to others?  See it all starts to overwhelm and I get undecided and just put it off.  Im so tired of not doing this i cant stand it and have decided to ask for advice.  

Any thoughts, preferences, advice, personal experience, horror stories will be appreciated. Even if you think its not what i wanna hear.  I can still proceed with my idiot plan, but at least im moving forward armed with some knowledge. Which is something i currently lack and again all these things will be experience. Hopefully good but if its bad its probably gonna be a lesson very well learned.  So help me out if you have any knowledge to share.  Thanks in advance. ",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,bitcoin,Fork With holding attack ,2024-09-10 09:59:10,"Hello everyone,I'm Moksha, a computer science student currently working on a project aimed at improving reward mechanics in mining pools to defend against Fork After Withholding (FAW) attacks.

Block withholding is a type of attack similar to selfish mining, where a pool member
withholds a mined block to undermine the pool’s revenue while submitting shares
consisting of PPoWs rather than FPoWs, creating the miner’s dilemma. In an FAW attack, an
attacker joins a Bitcoin mining pool and submits FPoWs when a non-target miner generates
a block. If the pool manager accepts the FPoW, it results in a blockchain fork, potentially
selecting the attacker’s block. This causes the target pool to receive rewards, shared with
the attacker. The FAW attack can yield rewards up to four times greater than the BWH
attack in large pools

Countermeasures: 

The idea is to have the pool manager track each user's reputation by monitoring metrics like Proof of Partial Work (PPOW). If a block submitted by a user leads to a fork, their reputation would decrease accordingly.I have a solid theoretical understanding of blockchain but lack practical experience. I’d appreciate any guidance on how to implement this in mining pools. Are there any simulation tools or resources that could help me get started?Thanks in advance!",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

However, I heard an experienced Bitcoin teacher say that creating a passphrase that’s easy for you to remember and that no one else knows is essential for extra protection. As proof, they mentioned the case of Glaidson Acácio dos Santos, who lost 500 bitcoins to the police because they got his seed. The teacher argued that if he had a passphrase, it would have been impossible for them to access the funds because even if they got the seed, they wouldn’t have had the passphrase, which would be stored in his memory.

Reddit,bitcoin,Where does the money from accumulated interest come from?,2024-09-09 22:48:23,"Edit 2: I don't think my question was clear, I don't mean where does the money come from that folks/gov use to pay back the interest, what I'm asking is, if there is $100 in the total money supply and the bank lends it out to various borrowers and the money paid back has incurred, for simplicity's sake, 10% interest, there would now be $110 in the total money supply is there not? So the amount of money in the money supply has increased by 10%. 

What does this mean for the overall value of $1 of that original $100?

------


This isn't a BTC question per se, but it was the question that got me interested in Bitcoin originally so I think it's a relevant topic.

Money Printer goes burr when the fed is literally printing money, but isn't interest also a form of adding more money to the money supply that also devalues a currency? 

For example, if the US debt load is incurring $1 trillon dollars in interest every 100 days, isn't that just like saying that every 100 days another trillion dollars have been added to the money supply? And if that's the case, isnt all interest paid by everyone all the time inflating the money supply and thereby reducing its value?

I just don't get how the newly created money from interest works. I remember when Zeitgeist was going around I think they talked about it, but is there an ELI5 explanation that someone can share with me?

TLDR; where does the money from interest come from?

Reddit,bitcoin,Fiat=bad narrative gets too repetitive sometimes,2024-09-09 16:27:22,"I’m relatively new to bitcoin (since April 2022) and when I look for educational contents online I found that the fiat=bad bitcoin=good narrative gets overly repetitive sometimes. It’s not that I don’t hold the same moralistic judgements and beliefs, but sometimes that’s all I hear in this space apart from technical discussions and advice. 

Sure that might be considered the most important aspect of bitcoin and hence the broken record, but I also think over the course of time bitcoin turned out to be incomprehensibly diverse in its definition, application, and implication beyond a decentralised “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”.

I found Jason Lowery’s idea of bitcoin as power and Gigi’s bitcoin as time really interesting and refreshing to hear, even though I don’t agree with all of their arguments. Project Alexandria on nostr is another fascinating idea. Are there any other “takes” on bitcoin that refreshed your perspective? I would love to hear more.

The rest i keep on an exchange. But I know not my keys not my coin. I'm feeling ready to move at least 50% off the exchange and into a wallet but I really don't even trust myself not to lose it. 

I lost my very first wallet when the paper I'd written my words on got wet and I couldn't figure out the seed phrase.

These days I travel non stop and worry about keeping up with any kind of hardware or losing any paper I might use to write seeds on.

I had issues with my phone and had to factory reset it and totally forgot to transfer my btc, but thankfully I was able to pull it from an old phone which still had my wallet on it.

So what is the most dummy proof way to secure my crypto without losing it because I'm an idiot?

Reddit,bitcoin,One of the most underrated Bitcoin posts on X,2024-09-08 21:54:32,"**Original Source** [https://x.com/danieleripoll/status/1728861014127763538](https://x.com/danieleripoll/status/1728861014127763538) 

The cult-classic movie The Matrix metaphorically describes the fiat monetary system in a scary accurate way. In the movie, AI robots create a mirage for the entire human species in order to absorb all of their life energy. In this world, humans lived a lie while their life energy was drained, unbeknownst to them, for the benefit of the machines. Humans were reduced to batteries.   
  
Is the fiat system not EXACTLY like this?   
  
Replace AI with “bankers” or the “political class” and it’s the same thing. The mirage is that we are sold the American Dream. We take out loans for school, we take on mortgages, we spend on our credit cards in a never ending debt cycle just to try to get ahead. But rather than allow the citizens to benefit from the productivity gains of technology and to save and build wealth over time, they deny us that ability by over taxing us, over regulating us, and debasing the currency.   
  
When J Powell was asked why 2% inflation, the Fed’s target, was even necessary, he couldn’t answer the question. He literally said “I don’t know” in front of a senate committee.   
  
I’ll tell you what J Powell won’t. The inflation is there to make sure you can’t get off the hamster wheel. The more you have to work, the more taxes you’ll generate for Uncle Sam. They want to make sure that they milk you for every ounce of your life’s energy through overt taxes like income,  
sales and property taxes, plus the hidden tax of inflation. Like a battery.   
  
In the movie, Morpheus had always been looking for “the one”. He sought the person who could beat the machines and liberate humanity by unplugging every single human being from the Matrix. I think people are ready. They sense a disturbance in the Matrix. Most cannot articulate the reason for the problems they face, but they know that something is wrong with the money.   
  
In the movie, if humans were made aware of their plight, many would have simply “opted out” of the Matrix by unplugging. If enough people unplugged, the robots would have no energy source. They would cease to exist. Similarly, if humans opted out of the fiat financial system, it too, would cease to exist.   
  
Bitcoin is “the one” technology that can unplug humanity from the fiat money matrix. Maybe economist Friedrich Hayek was actually Morpheus, because he prophesied the invention of Bitcoin long before anyone ever heard of Satoshi.   
  
“I don’t believe we shall ever have good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government…all we can do is by some sly, roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop.” - F. Hayek (aka Morpheus) on Bitcoin.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Win $500 in Bitcoin for sharing product feedback: Zengo Wallet AMA,2024-09-08 08:14:03,"We built Zengo in 2018 to fix the biggest problem with self-custody: Seed phrases. Zengo is not a hot or cold wallet. Zengo is a multi-factor MPC wallet: No seed phrase, no single point of failure.

Since 2018: Over 1,000,000 users and a milestone no hardware wallet can claim: 

* 0 wallets taken over
* 0 wallets drained
* 0 wallets phished

Seed phrase maxis may not be interested in Zengo. That's fine - every system has pros and cons. But Zengo's approach solves a problem for many who don't want to leave assets on an exchange, but are worried about seed phrases.

**So no seed phrase: How does Zengo work?**

1. Using a 2-of-2 Multi-Party Computation (MPC) framework, each of the two Zengo parties (Zengo app on user device and Zengo server)[ independently generate](https://zengo.com/how-keys-are-made/) their own “Secret Share” during the wallet creation process. The secret shares are cryptographically locked to prevent MITM attacks.
2. The share randomly generated on the user’s device is called the Personal Share and leverages the device’s hardware-based random number generator (TRNG). Only the Personal share can initialize and sign transactions, all of which are verified by the device’s hardware (Secure Enclave or TEE/Trusted Execution Environment).
3. The share randomly generated on Zengo’s remote server is called the Remote Share and is used to co-sign transactions emerging from the Personal Share.

Using MPC, these two Secret Shares are able to compute their corresponding public key securely. NOTE: We hold the world’s largest open-source cryptographic [MPC library](https://zengo.com/research/) on our GitHub, and all of our cryptography is open-source.

[Single-factor \(seed phrase\) v. Multi-factor \(MPC like Zengo\)](https://preview.redd.it/3e9h3x5vmjnd1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=d751e6069196b8ab35f768607ef445e818e068bc)

  
Even if a hacker gains access to one of the two secret shares, it is still useless to them as they cannot spend user funds.

Lose your phone? The wallet recovery process is simple and secure. More info [here](http://www.zengo.com/security). Worried Zengo closes? [Guaranteed Access](https://zengo.com/how-zengo-guarantees-access-to-customers-funds/) ensures you can always access your funds.

# August Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eight months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/mcaxyv3my5od1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=da26b8f86fd4dde37c87e3568c5e4678c117f3c8

# August Winners and Losers

***August Winners*** – No winners this month, although **XRP** (-6%) lost the least ground in August.

***August Losers*** – **ETH, DOT,** and **SOL** fell the most this month, dropping -23%, -22%, and -21% respectively.

# Overall Update: BNB securely in first place, BTC in second. 60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+61%) remains in the overall lead followed distantly by second place **BTC** (+28%). **SOL** (+16%) is third.

Eight months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -53% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** eight months ago is worth $161 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $156 in August.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$946.**  For the second time this year, the Top Ten Portfolio has ended a month below the break even point.

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a

**August Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14% 
* **AMKT**: -18%.

The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5%
*  **AMKT:** +7%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94

The S&P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Celsius Bankruptcy: A Comprehensive Guide To Calculating Your Losses (With Examples!),2024-09-11 11:05:48,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Kraken: 7 Days  
Coinbase: 7 Days

A very long time redditor who has lurked in the background :) Just managed to get myself setup so i can post here as i do see alot of projects i think are worth of sharing here, so first off...

Id like to introduce [Flipit.com](http://flipit.com/)

Ive been watching this project for some time now and its now being pushed into the web3 space by LFG incorporated - founded by the former head of blockchain at Gala Games, Jason BitBender Brink. [https://x.com/BitBenderBrink](https://x.com/BitBenderBrink)

I have been in the crypto space for around a decade and nothing has excited me more than this project... the ability to flip literally any website over and leave comments or reviews on it seems an absolute necessity. No longer will you need to research if a site is legit, just read the comments on the back of it to confirm your suspicions. I made my first ever video the other night when i flipped the page of [x.com](http://x.com/) and left some comments - [https://twitter.com/xhale2007/status/1828729919678902706](https://twitter.com/xhale2007/status/1828729919678902706)

A use i hadnt thought of last night... there was an X spaces running, trying to chat on it is near impossible as you have to wait for people to refresh etc, so we flipped the page and utilised the chat function. Something so simple yet so needed on the internet

They have just launched a node sale, well over 400 nodes have already sold in just a few days! They are reasonably priced too, which makes a change!! One thing i love about this... there is an actual product already fully operational, its not a case of selling a load of nodes and running away with the money, this already works on every single page online!!

The TGE is in around 80 days, nodes are for sale for around another 20 days, after which the nodes will start generating points daily for a share of the tokens initially. This is to prevent people getting a lions share of them before everyone gets a chance to buy a node for example.

Nodes are also NFTs from the get go, transferable after the TGE i believe.

If youre interested in the nodes - you can visit [http://get.flipit.com](http://get.flipit.com/) to purchase them",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Best crypto to invest in,2024-09-10 19:52:39,"I have been going through various premade [crypto portfolios](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios) and wondering what could be the best sector to bet on for my crypto investments.

After careful consideration, I have identified several crypto portfolios that I believe have strong potential for growth:

* [Layer 1 Blockchains](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Layer-1-Blockchains) These are foundational networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing the base layer of blockchain infrastructure.
* [Layer 2 Blockchains](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Layer-2-Blockchains) These solutions, like Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, aim to scale existing blockchains by processing transactions off-chain.
* [Decentralized Oracles](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Decentralized-Oracles) They play a crucial role in providing reliable data to smart contracts, bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world information.
* [Decentralized Data Storage](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Decentralized-Data-Storage) This sector focuses on distributed file storage systems, offering a more secure and censorship-resistant way to store data.
* [High Cap Altcoins](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Altcoin-High-Cap) Established alternative cryptocurrencies with significant market capitalizations, providing stability and potential for growth.

Additionally, two emerging sectors are gaining significant attention in the crypto community:

* [RWA](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/RWA) **(Real World Assets):** This sector is exploring the tokenization of physical assets like real estate and commodities, making them more accessible and tradable on blockchain platforms.
* [DePIN](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/DePIN) **(Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks):** This innovative sector involves decentralized networks that manage physical infrastructure like data centers or energy resources.

These sectors present diverse opportunities and risks, and understanding their potential can help in making informed crypto investment decisions.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,DCA+HODL only BTC is making more sense than ever when considering increasing global taxation.,2024-09-10 13:22:38,"As governments all over the world move to endorse 'crypto"" and the industry through it's taxation... the bull case for just hodl'n **only** BTC gets stronger.

At first many governments and the mainstream financial world tried to FUD Bitcoin out of existence but of course that didn't work. The second phase is trying to stifle Bitcoin and the wider crypto sector through onerous legislation and increased taxation. 

When it comes to regulation as we know from the BTC ETFs Vs SEC, Bitcoin has again survived and thrived. Almost every government in the world has now fully endorsed Bitcoin through their taxation policies that surround it. In the aftermath of a global pandemic all governments are keener than ever to raise taxes to pay down budget deficits. However for most governments taxation hasn't only been restricted to just Bitcoin, rather all of crypto and it's industry. Historically governments have used long-term taxation to silently cripple things they don't want/ like in society. Over the years many have laid the foundation to do just that on crypto.. however once more BTC will not only survive...but thrive. 

There's a growing push by governments to ensure people are paying crypto taxes. Where years ago they silently laid the foundations for crypto tax legislation, these days they are getting increasingly vocal in pointing them out and enforcement. All the major exchanges have been visited by major global tax authorities and confirmed their intention to work with them and provide them information where requested. 

More crypto related tax compliance software exists than ever as do accountants selling crypto as a specialism. Be it losses or gains with the changing crypto tax landscape more individual investors than ever are being dragged into the need to report crypto taxes. Interestingly, those with messy portfolio's with thousands of altcoin transactions creating variable capital gains and losses and many with thousands of fragments of staking rewards will suffer the greatest financial burden/ stress.. enough to say.. f**k this, I'm going Bitcoin Maxi. 

For the most part as an easy to store, highly divisible and liquid asset that for most typical users may only be likely to have to report on the odd capital gain.. Bitcoin is simple, effective and easy. Both as an asset and when it comes to tax. 

Real estate, Classic cars, precious metals etc ate often highly investable and make good stores of long-term value however Bitcoin is much more manageable. As capital gains tax across the world are increased HODL makes increasing sense. 

TL;DR

Dumping messy portfolio alts that onerous taxes may need reported on and avoiding investment in illiquid high maintenance assets when it comes to increasing global tax burdens means buying and hodling BTC is starting to make more sense than ever. 

Bitcoin maximalism has a very bright future. ",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Polkadot: A Decentralized Circus without a Ringmaster,2024-09-09 09:44:54,"*Zurich is a city of precision. It’s a place where every watch ticks with purpose, and every bank vault hides secrets worth more than a small country. But on a brisk morning, as I dragged my luggage through the bustling airport, something caught my eye—an enormous billboard, glowing pink, shouting “Polkadot” in bold letters. At first, I thought it was an advertisement for a new game, or perhaps some quirky Swiss banking service. What I didn’t expect was to stumble upon what might be the most confusing and hollow embodiment of decentralization in the blockchain world.*

You see, I’ve been on a journey. A quest to understand this nebulous concept of decentralization, a term that’s thrown around like confetti at a political rally. Everyone talks about it, few understand it, and even fewer can make it work. When it comes to blockchain, decentralization is supposed to eliminate single points of failure, democratize power, and provide security through consensus. But Polkadot, as I would discover, takes this concept, puts it in a blender, and serves it up as a watered-down cocktail that leaves you wondering if the bartender spiked it with anything at all.

When I landed in Zurich, I thought I’d find something serious behind this flashy marketing. Switzerland, after all, is synonymous with quality and reliability. But as I started peeling back the layers of this project, I quickly realized that Polkadot’s association with the Swiss ethos was purely coincidental. If anything, the most Swiss thing about Polkadot was the labyrinthine network of shell companies designed to obscure who’s really pulling the strings.

Through some well-placed connections, I found myself sipping overpriced coffee with a couple of Zurich’s financial elites—people who know their way around money and aren’t easily impressed by the latest tech fads. I asked them what they thought of Polkadot. A prominent lady banker, who had seen her fair share of financial scams, simply laughed. She called it a case of “investor defraud,” wrapped up in a cute pink logo. Apparently, Polkadot started out selling tokens as securities, but when the regulatory heat got too hot, they magically transformed them into “software,” sidestepping scrutiny in a move that’s as clever as it is suspicious.

Her colleague, a private banking expert, wasn’t any kinder. He dismissed Polkadot as another blockchain project that’s still fumbling to find a compelling use case. Sure, they’ve got something called “parachains,” but in the world of high finance, that means little when no one’s actually using them. The only people who seem to care are those still stuck in the cryptosphere, clinging to the hope that Polkadot will one day matter.

As I dug deeper, I discovered a governance model that’s more reminiscent of a reality TV show than a serious decentralized network. Token holders get to vote, but like in any rigged game, the more tokens you have, the louder your voice. It’s not one vote per person, but rather a dystopian democracy where the whales call the shots, leaving the minnows to scream into the void. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the drama doesn’t stop there.

There’s a particularly juicy beef between Polkadot’s tech provider and a wallet company that once played nice but is now leading a rebellion. This soap opera started when the fearless (literally, they were called Fearless Wallet) team decided they were tired of playing second fiddle. They forked off, launched their own product, and left behind a trail of bad blood that’s still staining Polkadot’s reputation. The wallet provider, now a key player in Polkadot’s governance, seems hell-bent on torpedoing every proposal from their former parents, proving that in Web 3.0, nothing is sacred, and betrayal is just another day at the office.

In the end, what I found in Zurich was not a beacon of decentralization, but a confused and fractured ecosystem, struggling to find its place in the world. Polkadot, for all its grand ambitions and slick marketing, remains a project without a clear purpose. It’s a decentralized circus, but one where the clowns are outnumbering the ringmasters, and the audience is starting to lose interest. 

As I left Zurich, the billboard now felt more like a warning than an invitation—a reminder that not every blockchain project is worth the hype, and that sometimes, decentralization is just a fancy word for chaos.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

So I was wondering if we can do any better than Meet in the Middle key exchange.

I think we can.. and I got this idea, based on There Pass Protocol.

1. Alice picks a truly random large master table g of size n bits (say 1 GB long). She also chooses truly randomly a permutation p of n elements, consisting of a single cycle of length n.
2. Alice sends Bob the master g table with the bits permuted by p.
3. Bob receives and further permutes by a permutation q also of n elements consisting of a single cycle of length n.
4. Bob sends to Alice the result.
5. Alice applies p^-1 to the message from Bob and sends to Bob.
6. Bob receives second message from Alice and applies q^-1.

Now both Bob and Alice have the same info on master table g. This is since such permutations comute.

Potentially, it can be combined with Meet in the Middle Key exchange, by encrypting  step 5 with the short key obtained by MIM KE.

Note that permutations are not themselves sent but just their application to the large GMT.

This looks pretty cool and maybe quite secure to me.. am I missing something? Why is this not in literature? Or is it?

Thanks!

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 18:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments.

* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Thank you for your time, and happy Meshing!",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,Most Used Languages to Program Cryptography in Production?,2024-07-25 05:04:31,"Hello Everyone.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 16:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057

Reddit,crypto,What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,2024-07-21 12:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
    },

Reddit,crypto,Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,2024-07-19 13:24:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057
Reddit,crypto,Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,2024-07-19 05:22:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

https://preview.redd.it/6j48x6a1redd1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f10d930771d9ea0147e8ccb5342d551e4942b7

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377)

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)? T(tau) is required for generate the CRS which helps compute the commitment of H.T - this is that part of the CRS -  (tau^i * t(tau))/delta}_{i=0 to n-2}. T depends on number of gates in the circuit - i.e. T(tau) changes if now of gates in the circuit changes.",2024-09-11 12:17:03.863057
