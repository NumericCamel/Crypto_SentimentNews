This impressive rally has positioned Litecoin as one of the top-performing altcoins during a period of market uncertainty. Analysts and investors are now speculating about the potential for a massive breakout in the coming weeks as Litecoin continues to show relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst Top analyst BigCheds shared a detailed technical analysis, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks and gearing up to test multi-year highs around the $145 mark. This key resistance level has been a critical zone for Litecoin in previous cycles, and breaking above it could signal the start of a significant upward trend. Litecoin’s recent momentum has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors, who are watching closely for signs of a confirmed breakout. With the broader market still consolidating, Litecoin’s ability to outperform could set the stage for a bullish continuation, potentially taking the price to new heights. As the crypto market braces for its next move, Litecoin’s price action remains a focal point for traders. Breaking past the $145 level would solidify its bullish narrative and pave the way for further gains. Litecoin Prepares For A Breakout Litecoin has shown impressive relative strength, surging over 30% in the past week, while the broader market continues to face indecision. This notable performance has captured the attention of analysts and investors, with some expecting Litecoin to lead a bullish rally that could break multi-year highs and push into higher supply levels. However, caution remains among market experts, as the current price action could result in a fake breakout. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks. According to him, the key level to watch is around $145, a critical resistance zone that has acted as a barrier in the past. BigCheds stated that while the price momentum is promising, he remains skeptical until Litecoin can decisively clear this level and hold it as support.  The next few days will be crucial for Litecoin as altcoins across the market are finding support, and Bitcoin flirts with reclaiming the $100K mark. If Litecoin can sustain its momentum and break above the $145 level, it could solidify its position as one of the leading altcoins in the current market cycle. Conversely, failing to clear this key level could lead to a retracement, testing lower support zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ As the market watches closely, Litecoin’s ability to hold above recent gains and break past resistance will likely dictate its direction in the coming weeks. Whether this move is the start of a bullish rally or another fake-out remains to be seen, but its price action is undoubtedly setting the stage for significant market moves. LTC Testing Crucial Supply Levels Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $127 after experiencing a strong bullish surge, climbing over 23% in less than two days. The recent price action has been impressive, as LTC reclaimed range highs and successfully pushed above the critical $120 mark. This move has shifted market sentiment, placing significant pressure on bears as the price approaches the next key resistance zones at $140 and $145. The $140 and $145 levels represent crucial supply zones that have historically acted as barriers to further upward movement. A breakout above these levels would not only signal a continuation of the bullish trend but also set the stage for Litecoin to test its multi-year high at $147. Analysts believe that reclaiming and holding above this level would trigger a massive rally, potentially propelling LTC into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns However, the coming days will be critical for Litecoin’s price trajectory. Bulls need to maintain momentum and defend current levels to sustain this upward move. If LTC successfully breaks above $147, it could attract more buyers, fueling further gains. Conversely, failing to clear these resistance levels could lead to consolidation or a minor retracement before another attempt at a breakout. All eyes are now on Litecoin as it approaches a decisive phase. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

LTC dropped briefly to $102, then swiftly recovered and today rests securely above the $120 support zone. As positive momentum builds, experts are wondering whether Litecoin can reach the next crucial level: $128. At its current price of $127, it’s just a matter of time (hours?) before LTC can easily hit $128. Related Reading: Can XRP Hit $10,000? A Quadrillion Market Cap For The Coin If That Happens – Analyst Strong Recovery After Market Dip Traders have been drawn to Litecoin lately, particularly given its remarkable 25% increase over the past 30 days.

Should positive sentiment persist, the next main obstacle falls between $128 and $130. A clean break above this area would let the door open for a push toward $150 or possibly $170 in the next weeks. The past performance of Litecoin in pre- and post-halving cycles is one of the elements fostering this optimistic view. Some analysts contend that Litecoin’s present surge is still part of its extended bullish phase. Litecoin ETF Speculation Adds Fuel To The Fire Speculation about a possible Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is another main driver behind Litecoin’s current surge. Although Bitcoin ETFs are already causing stir in the market, investors are also considering other assets that would profit from same regulatory approval. Odds of Litecoin ETF approval at 90%.

Here’s What The Chart Says,2025-02-11 20:00:44+00:00,"The past 24 hours have seen bullish momentum return to XRP, with the cryptocurrency now reclaiming the $2.5 price level. This bullish momentum comes after a seven-day stretch of range consolidation between resistance at $2.5 and support at $2.3. Despite this consolidation of the price, technical analysis shows that XRP is still trading in a bullish setup, especially on the daily candlestick timeframe. Notably, this bullish setup shows that the XRP price is about to make a new all-time high run to $5. Bullish RSI Divergence And Strong Support Set The Stage Technical analysis of the XRP price, which was posted on the TradingView platform, shows that the cryptocurrency is on the verge of a maximum surge in the coming weeks. Technical indicators play a crucial role in this outlook, which is currently bullish, despite the recent price downturn.  Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Why The Target Is $8 One such technical indicator is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures momentum in price movements. The RSI, for one, is flashing a bullish divergence on the daily timeframe. This occurs when the RSI makes higher lows while price action makes lower lows, which is a signal of reversal to the upside.  Furthermore, technical analysis shows that despite the price downturn, XRP has managed to hold above strong support at $2. The ability of XRP to hold above the support means that the recent selling pressure wasn’t an XRP price weakness as many expect, but only a consequence of a wider downturn in the entire crypto market. With the bullish structure intact and selling pressure appearing to wane, the asset remains in a strong position for a renewed rally, with a $5 target in sight. Can XRP Break Its All-Time High And Rally To $5? XRP’s all-time high remains at $3.40 and has yet to return to this price level since January 7, 2018. However, the altcoin has been one of the best performers this cycle, and this all-time high might not stand for long. In a recent rally, the cryptocurrency surged to $3.36, only to face sharp rejection from bearish resistance just before breaking new ground. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction To $4.9: How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Drive The Next Wave A move to $5 would not only mark a new all-time high but also solidify XRP as the best performer this cycle. The path to this milestone, however, will require the cryptocurrency to overcome key resistance zones, particularly around the $2.8 and $3 levels, where selling pressure has shot up this cycle.  At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.51, having increased by about 4.5% in the past 24 hours. If bullish momentum continues to build and XRP successfully clears these barriers, the projected $5 price target could be within reach.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Massive Short Squeeze, Expert Warns",2025-02-11 18:30:40+00:00,"The Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) surged above 64% this week, its highest level since March 2021, sparking debate over an impending short squeeze that could send its price skyward. The stark warning comes from Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at Theya, who took to X on Monday to outline what he views as a decisive turning point for Bitcoin versus the rest of the digital asset market. A Historic Break In Bitcoin’s Correlation Patterns In his post, Consorti contends that Bitcoin’s recent price action marks the first time in its 16-year history that both its price and market dominance have risen in tandem. Historically, Bitcoin’s dominance would rise initially, only to wane as speculation spilled into altcoins. However, Consorti states: “This is the first time in history that bitcoin’s share of the total digital asset market is rising while its price is climbing. In past cycles, retail-driven speculation pushed bitcoin’s price up and later funneled money into altcoins, causing bitcoin dominance to decline. That dynamic is gone.” According to Consorti, the days when a broad altcoin rally would follow Bitcoin’s initial surge appear to be over. Bitcoin dominance recently touched 64%—its highest level since February 2021. Consorti attributes the phenomenon to a significant change in market participation: “This cycle, institutions, sovereigns, and long-term holders are leading the charge, increasingly allocating capital exclusively to bitcoin while largely ignoring the rest of the market.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Turns Neutral On Top Exchanges: What Happened Last Time Last week’s market turbulence resulted in what Consorti calls “the single-largest liquidation event in ‘crypto’ history,” citing data that more than $2.16 billion in positions were wiped out within 24 hours. Ethereum led the liquidation figures with $573 million, and the largest single liquidation—a $25.6 million ETH/BTC order—occurred on Binance. “As you might have guessed, ETH/BTC is not having a great time,” Consorti notes, pointing out that the ETH/BTC pair is trading at 0.026—its lowest level in over three years. He argues these liquidations highlight the precarious nature of heavily leveraged altcoin markets: “All of it wiped out in an instant when price moved against them. This wasn’t your standard technical correction, it marks the start of an extinction-level event for altcoins.” The “Altcoin Casino” In Crisis Consorti’s analysis suggests that what he dubs “the altcoin casino” is now collapsing. He points to failed narratives around popular projects—Ethereum, Solana, and DeFi among them—that have struggled to maintain investor confidence: “Altcoins have survived purely on narratives. Each cycle, a new batch of narratives emerged, promising world-changing innovation. None of them lasted.” He contrasts this with Bitcoin’s core value proposition, which, in his view, requires no marketing: “Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn’t need a narrative. It doesn’t need marketing or hype. It exists, and it thrives because it was built to do one thing—protect wealth in a world of perpetual monetary expansion.” Consorti also references Ethereum’s “merge” and its supposed deflationary design, pointing out that since the upgrade, ETH’s total supply has increased by 13,516 ETH—undermining the “ultra-sound money” claim. Related Reading: Bitcoin In 2025: History Could Repeat With A 2017-Style Surge Adding a policy dimension to the market’s transformation, Consorti highlights a statement from Senator John Boozman during the White House Crypto Working Group’s first press conference: “Some digital assets are commodities, some are securities.” This, he suggests, is a tacit acknowledgment that Bitcoin stands apart from other digital assets. In a further development, Consorti cites a comment from White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks, who mentioned the group is evaluating the viability of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—a shift from the previous “National Digital Asset Stockpile” terminology used under a Trump-era executive order. Consorti frames this as a “major development” that signals growing recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties: “This language shift is monumental. A few years ago, the US government was openly hostile toward bitcoin. Today, they’re discussing stockpiling it.” Amid this upheaval, Consorti suggests that the next dramatic move in Bitcoin could be an explosive short squeeze. Funding rates on perpetual futures, he notes, have gone “deeply negative,” reminiscent of when Bitcoin traded near $23,000 in August 2023. This implies a tilt in leverage toward traders betting against Bitcoin—a position that could rapidly unwind: “While last week’s leverage flush wiped out most long positions, the next major move could be the opposite—an explosive rally fueled by forced short liquidations.” Should the market turn against these short-sellers, the forced buy-backs could drive the price higher with unusual speed and volume—especially if overall liquidity remains thin. He concluded, “Traders who overextended their leverage to short bitcoin will eventually have to buy it back when the price moves against them, just like overleveraged longs were wiped out last week. Bitcoin is coiled. The stage is being set for a potential short squeeze. The longer this dynamic of short dominance persists, the greater the risk of a forced shirt liquidation cascade that sends bitcoin’s price higher with force.” At press time, BTC.D stood at 61.19%.

Government Prepares To End Ban,2025-02-11 17:00:16+00:00,"The sun could be set to shine brighter in Japan’s financial horizon, as regulators take another look at how Bitcoin will play a role in the country’s financial landscape. Authorities are now considering lifting a long-standing ban on Bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This might signal a new era in the government’s outlook on digital currencies. Related Reading: Can XRP Hit $10,000? A Quadrillion Market Cap For The Coin If That Happens – Analyst If given the green light, this action would open doors for both institutional and retail investors by aligning Japan with other big financial hubs embracing crypto-based investment products. Crypto ETFs May Soon Become A Reality In Japan Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), is apparently considering approving Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This will change the investing environment of the country greatly. For years, the ban on these funds has limited the ways in which investors might have access to digital assets via regulated financial instruments. Japan appears to be closely monitoring the United States’ recent approval of numerous Bitcoin spot ETFs. The introduction of crypto ETFs, according to analysts, would offer investors a more structured and secure method of participating in the digital asset market, without the risks associated with direct ownership. Japan Advocates For Tax Reforms That Favor Crypto Apart from the acceptance of ETFs, Japan is looking at major tax changes that would boost the attractiveness of bitcoin investments. Currently, profits from cryptocurrencies are liable to taxes at rates ranging from up to 55%, which has discouraged investors. Still, authorities are thinking about lowering the rate to 20% to match the taxation of stocks and other traditional financial assets. This change most likely would be a motivation for other traders and institutions to enter the market. If implemented, the new tax policy has the potential to establish Japan as one of the most crypto-friendly economies in Asia, thereby attracting substantial capital inflows. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes $387 For Solana As Key Support Levels Strengthen—Details Reclassifying Cryptocurrencies As Financial Products Along with a bigger plan to make regulations clearer, the FSA is also considering whether cryptocurrencies should be considered regular financial assets, like stocks or bonds. If this goes into action, crypto assets will have to follow stricter rules for reporting and disclosing information. This will make the industry more open and protect investors. This change in the law may calm big investors’ fears of price manipulation, fraud, and a lack of oversight, which have been holding them back in the past. Japan’s move to recognize digital assets as a safe form of investment could be a model for other countries to follow.

TVL on Solana rose to $8.6B, an incredible growth of 486% from last year. Furthermore, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate also stood at an impressive 64%. After amassing a record-breaking TVL in 2024, Solana now ranks second among blockchains after it surpassed Tron in December. Whether it’s the meme coin niche (with Pump.fun) or decentralized finance (DeFi) overall, Solana is on a roll as far as blockchain development goes. With Solana looking stronger than ever, here are the five best altcoins to buy to position yourself behind in anticipation of the upcoming Solana bull run. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Altcoin on Solana for First-Time Investors Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the most anticipated meme coins of 2025. And why wouldn’t it be? After all, it’s the native currency of the new Solana Layer-2 network. Although Solana ($SOL) is already a popular blockchain network competing on equal footing with much older players like Ethereum and Bitcoin, some core structural issues are holding back its potential. Long story short, Solana’s infrastructure isn’t equipped to handle the amount of traffic it has been getting, which has led to frequent bottlenecks (including failed transactions) and congestion. $SOLX, however, is built to eliminate all these issues, guaranteeing fast transactions and a seamless experience. The project’s presale is currently ongoing, and having raised over $19M so far, it’s undoubtedly one of the best crypto presales out there. In addition to massive listing gains, which analysts predict may happen, early adopters can also benefit from the project’s 208% staking rewards. Currently, each token is priced at $0.001632. If this is your meme coin purchase, here’s how to buy $SOLX. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Autonomous AI Agent Using Hive-Mind Analysis MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a self-evolving AI agent capable of cutting through all the clutter and noise online surrounding the crypto market to identify cryptos that are actually worth buying. What’s more, this AI bot is capable of operating systems, too. For example, it runs its own X account and can access other blockchain apps and launch new tokens, as well as help you operate your crypto wallet. MIND of Pepe has been so well received by crypto (and AI) enthusiasts that it raised a whopping $1M within just 24 hours of its presale. So far, the $MIND presale has raised more than $5.7M, and the best AI agent coin is currently priced at just $0.0033055. Here’s how to buy it. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Altcoin of the Best Crypto Wallet in the Market Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of the popular crypto wallet by the same name, Best Wallet. The wallet’s aim is simple. It wants to be the fastest, the most efficient, and the most user-friendly crypto wallet with at least 40% of the market share of all non-custodial wallets. This makes $BEST one of the ‘best’ cryptos to watch out for. $BEST token holders get a lot of additional benefits within the Best Wallet ecosystem. These include lower transaction fees, voting rights on the project’s future, and access to promising new tokens at the earliest possible stage. With over $9.5M in its presale purse at the time of writing, the $BEST presale, which started in November last year, has been a raging success. Position yourself behind the leading crypto wallet by investing in $BEST. You can get 1 $BEST for just $0.02395 if you get in now. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Solana Meme Coin Spreading Stink and Gains Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is a meme coin on the Solana network that allows users to earn free tokens by simply submitting a fart joke. Moreover, every time you make a transaction on the platform, it emits a fart sound, further adding to the absurdity of this token. The way Fartcoin started is also an interesting story. The Truth Terminal AI chatbot was asked to create a new token based on Elon Musk’s alleged amusement with fart jokes – and Fartcoin is what we got as a result. What started as a joke, however, has grown into a formidable crypto project. Despite recent dips, the token is still up 942% in the last 365 days. $FARTCOIN is currently trading at $0.61, which makes it a good long-term purchase. 5. ai16Z ($AI16Z) – Red Hot AI Crypto on the Solana Network The AI-crypto partnership has only just begun and we already have a handful of revolutionary altcoins, with $AI16Z being possibly the most noteworthy of the lot. Launched late in 2024, ai16Z is a new cryptocurrency that combines AI with blockchain. It’s the first AI-led decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that promises to revolutionize the investment landscape.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Top New Crypto to Buy as Japan Considers Approving Bitcoin ETFs,2025-02-11 15:53:25+00:00,"Japan is making a dramatic shift in its stance on cryptocurrency. The Financial Services Agency (FSA), which once imposed a steep 55% tax on crypto income, is now considering lowering it to a more manageable 20%. Additionally, Japan is exploring the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, potentially reversing its previous ban on the asset. This move likely comes as a result of SoftBank’s foray into crypto. Nevertheless, the country now looks keen to align itself with the rest of the world as far as the crypto consensus is concerned. With yet another major economy changing its stance on crypto and wanting to become a participant in the digital asset market, crypto’s power, influence, and potential are on full display. If you’d like to join the crypto bandwagon and make some handsome returns yourself, here are the best new crypto to buy now. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best New Crypto to Buy Now Solana ($SOL) remains one of the top cryptocurrencies, consistently demonstrating strong market performance. Known for its high-speed, low-cost transactions, Solana has gained traction among developers, investors, and institutions. Its expanding ecosystem, spanning DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications, further cements its position as a key player in the crypto space. For instance, it has reported increasing market share in DEX volumes, revenues, and active users, plus the technical side looks solid too, with support being held above key levels. However, Solaxy ($SOLX) is what can really act as a catalyst to Solana’s growth and send it soaring past all-time highs. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy aims to improve the network massively by solving pertinent issues like congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. The project’s presale numbers are further proof of Solaxy’s future potential. Over $19M has been raised so far, and each token is currently being offered at just $0.001632. Interested? Here’s how to buy $SOLX. 2. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) – Benefit from Bitcoin’s Success and Multiply Your Investment BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) embodies the spirit of a true Bitcoin supporter. As one of the most promising new presale tokens, $BTCBULL offers a unique incentive for its holders, rewarding them with Bitcoin ($BTC) airdrops whenever the original cryptocurrency hits key price milestones of $150K, $200K, and $250K. This innovative model not only aligns with Bitcoin’s long-term growth but also provides investors with direct exposure to its success, making $BTCBULL an exciting opportunity for those bullish on BTC’s future. Furthermore, BTC Bull has a clear plan to boost its value by burning a portion of its total supply when Bitcoin ($BTC) reaches $125K, $175K, and $225K. By reducing the number of tokens in circulation, demand is expected to rise, helping to push the price higher – a real incentive for investors. The market is well and truly impressed with BTC Bull and its unique way of rallying behind the crypto economy. The $BTCBULL presale, which launched just over a day ago, has already amassed a mind-boggling $569K. You can join the $BTCBULL-ish madness by shelling out just $0.002355 per token. Check out their X account and Telegram channel for more details on what they’re trying to do. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Cutting-Edge AI Tech Offering Crypto Investment Advice If you’re tired of being beaten by the deceptive crypto market time and time again, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is here to be your ultimate crypto investment buddy. It’s a self-evolving and autonomous AI agent that will provide real-time actionable market insights to its token holders by scanning chit-chat on X and elsewhere on the web. Don’t mistake $MIND’s recommendations for any unsolicited advice you find lying around the corner these days. It strategically interacts with crypto folks online, understands the market sentiment, and only then narrows down on the cryptos worth buying. Additionally, $MIND can amplify its recommendations by shaping online trends and driving hype, creating momentum that benefits its token holders and boosts profitability. Mind of Pepe will also provide token holders with priority access to the best crypto presales. The presale is currently alive and kicking, with more than $5.7M in its kitty already. 1 $MIND is currently available for just $0.0033055, but hurry up because prices will increase in the next few hours. Check out our How to buy $MIND guide for more info. 4. Litecoin ($LTC) – Digital Silver Delivering Consistent Returns Litecoin has been one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies in the last year or so, generating around 80% returns for long-term investors. However, it finds a place in this list because of a recent development that has turned it very bullish. A couple of weeks ago, $LTC became the only altcoin after $ETH whose exchange-traded fund has been greenlit by the higher authorities. It’s also worth noting that $LTC is considered more legitimate and, therefore, a better investment than other top altcoins because it’s a hard fork of Bitcoin. Basically, if $BTC is digital gold, $LTC is digital silver, which is why it’s highly likely to follow Bitcoin to the moon. As a result, the token has seen some absolutely fantastic jumps recently. Up almost 25% this week – and over 11% in just the last 24 hours – $LTC is currently trading at $127. 5. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Pro-crypto Trump’s Meme Coins Poised for Massive Growth Donald Trump’s rise to fame among crypto enthusiasts saw his own meme coin, $TRUMP, shoot up by over 12,000% in a single day almost immediately after its launch in January. Almost one month after the initial frenzy, $TRUMP has settled down and is currently trading at around $16, making it among the best cheap cryptos to buy now. Although the price has fallen, the fundamentals remain as solid as they were on day one. After all, Trump’s still seen as a crypto lover and seems to be rolling out one crypto-friendly change after another. Note the changes in the SEC leadership group, for example. All in all, the token carries unquestionable potential thanks to Trump’s seemingly pro-crypto mindset, which has been a major contributor to Bitcoin’s extremely bullish outlook for 2025 and beyond. Conclusion So these are the top crypto to buy now and potentially become a millionaire in the coming months. No promises, though, as the crypto market is quite infamous for its volatility. As always, we recommend that you only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing and do your own research before tipping your toes in crypto. Also, none of the above is financial advice.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Analyst Says You’ll Regret Not Buying Ethereum At These Prices, Here’s Where It’s Headed",2025-02-11 15:30:43+00:00,"According to a crypto analyst, the Ethereum price is on the verge of a breakout, and investors who don’t buy it now could be left with regrets later. With technical indicators pointing towards a significant price surge, the analyst forecasts that Ethereum (ETH) could climb as high as $12,000 this bull cycle. Ethereum Price Headed To $12,000? Prominent crypto analyst Captain Faibik has issued a stark warning to investors, urging them to buy Ethereum at a particular price low or risk entering the market late and regretting it. With Ethereum’s current price action signaling a potential bullish breakout, Faibik predicts that the cryptocurrency can hit a new all-time high of $12,000 in 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade Looking at the analyst’s Ethereum price chart, the timeline for this ambitious projection is set around Q4 2025, more than eight months from now. Faibik indicated that Ethereum has been within a consolidation symmetrical Triangle for a while and finally looks ready to bottom.  This week, Ethereum appears to have broken through the descending resistance line of the symmetrical triangle, indicating the start of a potential price rebound. Faibik believes Ethereum has likely hit its market bottom at $2,648 and could go up from here.  Historically, cryptocurrencies that reach a bottom tend to experience a major rally as prices stabilize and momentum builds after consolidation. In the case of Ethereum, Faibik has highlighted the purported $2,648 price bottom as a key buy-the-dip opportunity.  Furthermore, the analyst suggested that entering the market at this level was crucial, as investors risk missing out on potential gains. Faibik predicts that once Ethereum initiates a bounce back, its price could skyrocket as high as $12,000. This massive rally would represent a 353.7% surge, marking Ethereum’s highest price increase since its previous bull run.  Sharing similar bullish sentiments, Kazi, another crypto analyst on X, forecasts that Ethereum will reach $12,203. The analyst also highlighted a breakout from a symmetrical triangle as the trigger for this bullish surge to new ATHs.  ETH Gas Fees Crash, Sparks Rally Speculations In other news, Ethereum’s gas fees have experienced a significant crash, sparking rumours of a potential price rally. Crypto analyst Merlijn the Trader announced this report to his over 312,000 followers on X. The analyst revealed that the Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin, had previously promised to fix the initial high gas fees, making them more affordable for the network users. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Large Consolidation Trend Points To Possible Price Explosion To $8,000 Now, average Ethereum gas fees are down to 0.794 gwei ($0.04), marking a major decrease from their previous high of 0.873 gwei ($0.05). Due to this unexpected but highly welcomed development, Merlijn the Trader, questions whether the crash in Ethereum’s gas fees is signaling the start of ETH’s next rally.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Can Bitcoin Hold $97K? – 1-3 Month Holders’ Data Reveals Crucial BTC Demand,2025-02-11 14:00:19+00:00,"Bitcoin has experienced a quiet weekend, with the price remaining stagnant around the $96,500 level for five consecutive days. This prolonged period of consolidation highlights the current indecisive nature of the market. Bulls have been unable to reclaim control and push Bitcoin above the critical $100K mark, while bears are also struggling to drive the price lower toward key demand levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ The lack of direction has left investors and analysts watching closely for signals of the next major move. The broader market sentiment remains cautious, with many questioning whether Bitcoin can regain bullish momentum or if a deeper correction is on the horizon. Key metrics shared by crypto expert Axel Adler on X provide some insight into the current dynamics. According to Adler, the $97K level serves as a strong support zone, representing the average purchase price for Bitcoin short-term holders. This suggests that a significant portion of market participants are still confident in Bitcoin’s ability to hold above this level despite the lack of upward momentum. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong As Indecision Drives The market  Bitcoin has been navigating through weeks, even months, of uncertainty and speculation, leaving investors divided about its short-term direction. Bulls have struggled to push the price back above the critical $100K mark, while bears have been unable to break below key support levels. This stalemate has created a market characterized by indecision, with volatility continuing to dominate price action. The absence of a clear trend has caused frustration among investors, many of whom had anticipated a stronger rally earlier this year. Instead, Bitcoin has been consolidating within a range, bouncing between its $109K all-time high and support levels around $90K. For now, the market seems stuck in this phase, with no immediate catalyst to break out. Top analyst Axel Adler has provided crucial insights into the current dynamics. According to Adler, the $97K level is acting as strong support, as it represents the average purchase price for short-term holders who have held their Bitcoin for one to three months. This data suggests that many market participants are still confident in Bitcoin’s ability to hold this level, even as broader uncertainty looms. If Bitcoin can sustain this support in the coming days, analysts anticipate a potential rally back toward range highs around $109K. However, failure to maintain this level could pave the way for further downside, testing lower demand zones. For now, the market remains on edge, waiting for Bitcoin’s next decisive move. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst BTC Price Action Details: Key Levels Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,000 after spending the past week in a tight range between the $100K psychological resistance and the $94,500 low. This range-bound price action highlights indecision in the market, as bulls and bears struggle to gain control. For Bitcoin to confirm a short-term reversal and regain bullish momentum, bulls need to reclaim the $98K mark as support and push decisively above the $100K level. Breaking and holding above this critical resistance could set the stage for a move toward higher price levels, potentially targeting all-time highs around $109K. A successful reclaim of the $100K level would signal renewed strength and confidence in the market, sparking optimism among investors. On the flip side, failure to hold above the $95K support level could open the door for further downside. A drop below $95K might send Bitcoin into lower demand zones, with the $90K level acting as the next key support. Such a move could further fuel bearish sentiment and extend the current consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Below $2,800 Resistance – Bulls Need A Higher Low To Recover As the market continues to consolidate, investors are closely monitoring these levels for clues about Bitcoin’s next move. With both bulls and bears testing their limits, the coming days will likely determine the short-term direction of BTC’s price.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,This Dogecoin Chart Formation Could Catapult Meme Coin Over $1—Analyst,2025-02-11 12:30:27+00:00,"Investors are once again becoming drawn to Dogecoin (DOGE). This time, analysts have found a pattern that could send the famous meme coin soaring past the long-awaited $1 mark. DOGE hit its all-time high of $0.74 during the 2021 bull run, but it has since had a hard time getting back to that level. But now, one market expert thinks that the past might be about to happen again, this time with even bigger gains. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst A Pattern That Points To Rapid Growth Chandler, a crypto analyst, says that Dogecoin has been following a familiar cycle since December 2023. The cycle has three main parts: a breakout to new highs, a brief pullback, and then a sharp rebound that goes above the previous peak. This pattern has already happened twice, and if it happens again, DOGE could be about to have a big recovery. The most recent high of $0.85, followed by a pullback, suggests that the next move could push Dogecoin to an estimated $1.80—a gain of over 112% from its last peak. While price patterns don’t guarantee future performance, Dogecoin’s history of explosive rallies fueled by hype, speculation, and retail enthusiasm makes such a scenario plausible. Over the past year, every higher high $DOGE made was 112% higher than the previous one. 112% above the last top puts us at $1. 🚀🌕 pic.twitter.com/al8D86UGq0 — Chandler⚡️ (@ChandlerCharts) January 26, 2025 Market Sentiment And The $1 Psychological Barrier Overcoming $1 has long been a psychological and technological obstacle for Dogecoin. Even though there was a lot of excitement and significant support from people like Elon Musk, the previous effort in 2021 was unsuccessful. However, the circumstances for another breakthrough seem to be developing given Bitcoin’s continued success and the momentum that altcoins are getting. Sentiment is a significant factor in the fluctuations of Dogecoin. In the past year, DOGE has achieved gains of nearly 200%, surpassing Bitcoin’s 110% increase. The possibility of surpassing $1 is not only conceivable, but it may occur sooner than most individuals anticipate if this outperformance continues. Related Reading: Can XRP Hit $10,000? A Quadrillion Market Cap For The Coin If That Happens – Analyst Caution Amid The Hype Historical patterns can provide useful insights, but they are not totally reliable. The price of Dogecoin remains very volatile, and external variables such as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, and larger market trends can all have an impact on its movement. Investors who are interested in participating in the prospective breakout should exercise caution when evaluating the risks. Profits can be substantial, but pullbacks can be equally rapid due to Dogecoin’s speculative nature. However, the forthcoming months may serve as a pivotal moment for the original meme coin, as DOGE’s chart indicates signs of life and the $1 barrier approaches. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.2671, up 5.7% and 2.8% in the daily and weekly frames. Featured image from Gemini Imagen, chart from TradingView",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Reddit,solana,How to buy meme coins in 2025 - a comprehensive guide for new buyers,2025-02-11 21:08:05,"When I first started buying and trading meme coins, I felt as though I was extremely overwhelmed by the amount of options available for wallets/trading/watching. It took me some time to sift through what I had at my fingertips, but I eventually found my groove. Going to try and summarize the major points I learned here to hopefully help those just learning now, especially with big coins like Dave Portnoys and Trumps hitting the market.

**Getting Started: Platforms and Trading Options**

1. **Set Up a Wallet**: Begin by funding a secure wallet compatible with your chosen blockchain.
2. **Identify the Coin**: Research and select the meme coin you're interested in. Ensure you have the correct contract address to avoid scams.
3. **Execute the Trade**: Utilize decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or platforms to swap your base cryptocurrency (like SOL) for the desired meme coin.
4. **Monitor and Manage**: Keep track of your investments and be prepared to act swiftly in the volatile meme coin market.

**Alternative Approach**

For those seeking a more streamlined experience without the complexities of traditional wallets and DEXs, there are many platforms that offer user-friendly interfaces. They allow for quick transactions using familiar methods, making it easier to navigate the meme coin market.

**Investment Strategies**

* **High-Risk Ventures**: Investing in newly launched meme coins can yield significant returns but comes with heightened risk. Due diligence is crucial.
* **Community-Backed Tokens**: Focus on meme coins with active communities and transparent development teams. These often exhibit more stability and long-term potential.
* **Network Building**: Engage with influencers and developers within the meme coin space. Building relationships can provide insights into promising projects and early investment opportunities.

**Understanding Basic Graph Trends**

One of the most important skills when investing in meme coins (or any crypto) is learning how to read basic graph trends. While the meme coin market can be highly unpredictable, spotting patterns can help you make informed decisions. Here are a few key things to look out for:

1. **Support and Resistance Levels**
   * **Support**: The price level where a coin tends to stop falling and bounces back up.
   * **Resistance**: The price level where a coin struggles to break above.
   * Knowing these levels can help you decide when to buy or sell.
2. **Volume Spikes**
   * A sudden increase in trading volume often signals big moves in price—either up or down.
   * High volume with rising prices could mean strong interest in the coin, while high volume with falling prices may indicate heavy sell-offs.
3. **Upward and Downward Trends**
   * Look for consistent **higher highs** and **higher lows** to spot an upward trend (bullish).
   * Conversely, **lower highs** and **lower lows** indicate a downward trend (bearish).
4. **Breakouts**
   * A breakout occurs when a coin's price moves beyond a significant support or resistance level, often signaling a new trend.
5. **Beware of FOMO Traps**
   * Parabolic spikes (sharp, sudden price increases) are often followed by equally sharp drops. Recognizing unsustainable trends can save you from buying at the peak.

**BIG TIP**  
Ensure that your twitter account, or your burner twitter account is optimized to receive crypto themed tweets and suggested content. Ensure you interact and follow meme coin and gem accounts.

**Final Thoughts**

The meme coin market in 2025 is both thrilling and unpredictable. While the allure of substantial gains is ever-present, it's imperative to approach investments with caution, conduct thorough research, and stay informed about market trends. Remember, while the potential for profit is significant, so are the risks involved.

*I know a lot of this information may seem redundant, but there are a lot of new users coming into the sub seeking advice and answers on how to navigate the market. This is made in order to help push them in the right direction*",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

But if all you do is **trade, you’re missing the bigger picture.**

The **real players in Solana** aren’t just flipping charts—they are **creating the future.**   
  
Let’s break down the **5 major paths**. 👇

# Solana is NOT Just About Trading

If you think **the only way to make it in Solana is by trading, you’re playing a small game.**  


💡 **There are at least 5 different ways people carve out their spot in the ecosystem:**

1️⃣ **Trading** – Learning how markets move, sniping plays, and tracking trends. 📈  
2️⃣ **Marketing & Growth** – Helping projects **gain visibility** and directing attention. 🎯  
3️⃣ **Developing** – Building **smart contracts, bots, and infrastructure.** 🛠  
4️⃣ **Building & Innovating** – Creating **entire ecosystems, not just one-off projects.** 🏗  
5️⃣ **Influencing & Content Creation** – Shaping **narratives and leading communities.** 🗣

👉 **Now, let’s break them down.**

https://preview.redd.it/9mj3vqwrfiie1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=865bfd8e23f873714e37f21ef0577ad4218f4a47

# Trading – Playing the On-Chain Game

* Trading isn’t **just buying low and selling high**—it’s about understanding the market.
* The best traders **front-run narratives, track liquidity, and read on-chain signals.**
* **Instead of chasing hype, they study market cycles and exit before the herd.**

🚨 **If you’re trading based on Twitter calls, you’re already late.**

# Marketing & Growth – The Attention Game

* **Every successful project in Solana needs attention.** Without it, even great ideas die.
* Good marketing isn’t just **shilling**—it’s about **crafting narratives** and directing the right eyeballs to the right place.
* The best **Solana marketers** create **viral campaigns, manage KOL relationships, and sustain hype.**

🔥 **If you know how to build hype and direct attention, you can make anything move.**

# Developing – Building the Tools That Matter

* Everything in crypto runs on **code.** The **best traders, builders, and market makers** depend on devs.
* Smart contract engineers, bot developers, and tool creators **control the infrastructure.**
* **If you can build, you can dictate how the ecosystem evolves.**

🚀 **The biggest projects on Solana—Pump.fun, Tensor, Jupiter—came from devs who saw what was missing and built it.**

# Building & Innovating – Founders Who Change the Game

* Some of the **biggest winners in Solana aren’t just traders—they’re builders.**
* [**Pump.fun**](http://Pump.fun) **wasn’t just a tool—it shaped an entire market meta.**
* The best builders don’t **just launch tokens—they build ecosystems** that keep growing.

🔑 **If you launch something people need, you create your own economy.**

# Influencing & Content Creation – Controlling the Narrative

* In crypto, **narratives move markets.**
* The biggest influencers don’t just **report trends—they start them.**
* Many top voices on Solana **began by sharing insights, breaking down patterns, and consistently posting value.**

📢 **If you control what people talk about, you control where liquidity flows.**

https://preview.redd.it/9i5jf78ngiie1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e1ea196f56934250dd9d73fab75fd3cf2cfb126

# Why This Matters

* If **all you do is trade, you’re playing a small game.**
* The biggest winners **create, not just consume.**
* **Traders react—builders, marketers, and devs shape the space.**

Reddit,solana,Did people actually buy my coin?,2025-02-12 00:14:01,"My buddy fell asleep during the super bowl (I don't blame him). When he woke up he had some crazy hair going on so I took a pic of him. I had PF up on my computer already and ive always wanted to make a meme coin so I decided to make one called bAdhairday coin and used my buddies pic I had just taken of him. I've never made a meme coin before so I was hoping you guys could explain what on earth happened? According to what I see people actually bought the coin which is something I never expected in a million years, especially off of something so random/silly. I dont really remember since I had been drinking but I think I bought like $5 worth of the coin, but im showing people were buying up to 3 sol which is crazy if accurate.  

Can someone explain if im reading this correctly?

Reddit,solana,Why'd several adsresses send millions of tokens to streamflow?,2025-02-11 21:15:34,"Hi!

I was a longtime holder in a coin that I believed in and sadly sold out. The Dev is MIA, he comes and goes and gives some news and whenever his plans are not fulfilled, the FUD takes over the community and the price drops. It is a utility coin and we have been waiting for development for weeks but it doesn't come. Token creator holds 0 of the token. However, I looked at a lot of the whales in the top holders, and a lot of them send millions of coins into Streamflow. As I understand, that website is used for staking or vesting coins. However, I can't find any staking for this coin. Is this not weird? Do whales get any kind of money or is this some kind of scheme by the dev to amass coins and vest it in Streamflow?

For example, when extracting the top 20-30 holders of a token, I want to trace the source of their SOL funds to understand their origin. However, many top holders are related to platforms like Raydium pools, MEXC exchange wallets, Jupiter limit orders, or other DeFi entities. I want to filter these out and focus only on personal wallets.

What are the best ways to identify non-personal wallets? Are there specific RPC methods, instructions, or heuristics to detect CEX/DEX/DeFi-related addresses? Any insights or resources would be appreciated!

Reddit,solana,Restaking Comes to Solana—Just Like EigenLayer on Ethereum,2025-02-11 06:24:12,"Solayer is the first restaking protocol on Solana, bringing a concept that has been making waves on Ethereum to an entirely different ecosystem. Unlike EigenLayer or Karak, which are built for Ethereum-based chains, Solayer is designed specifically for Solana, taking full advantage of its low fees and fast transactions. It allows $SOL stakers to restake their assets, providing security for dApps and L1 networks while earning additional rewards. It also introduces a shared validator model, which helps developers customize how their applications interact with the blockchain. On top of that, Solayer launched $sUSD, a stablecoin backed by US T-bills, adding another layer of functionality. In simpler terms, it lets Solana users earn extra rewards on their staked $SOL while making the network stronger and more efficient.

  
At first, I wasn’t sure how different Solayer really was from Ethereum’s restaking protocols, but after seeing how it fits within Solana’s ecosystem, it started to make sense. It isn’t just copying what’s been done before, it’s adapting the model to work for Solana’s speed and architecture. Now, with a Bitget listing coming soon, it’s clear that more people are starting to take notice. Whether it keeps growing or faces challenges, it’ll be interesting to see how Solayer shapes restaking on Solana in the long run.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,solana,"5 Best Solana APIs, SDKs, and Plugins for Web3 dApp Development",2025-02-10 14:11:58,"Solana is taking its first steps to 2025 with impressive moves and numbers, breaking its own records of daily on-chain activities and DEX volume. As a new US President's team chose Solana to launch his $TRUMP memecoin on, the network met an incredibly high user inflow, coming even closer to mass adoption. Day by day Solana attracts more and more users and developers, which makes it the most interesting blockchain in the perspective of 2025.

Not only the SOL itself but also its ecosystem projects gained much attention and investments last month. Solana already has a vast ecosystem, but there's still so much more exciting stuff that could be built.  Moreover, the biggest ecosystem’s protocols could become not your competitors but great strategic partners as most of them provide powerful APIs and SDKs that you could integrate into your dApp! So, now is the perfect time and last chance for devs to really get into Solana and build the next big thing!

# Solana Development 101: tools and tips

If you're new to Solana, start by learning the very basics, such as exploring its core architecture and native programming language. Solana's comprehensive docs, guides, and courses are your go-tos at this stage. It's also a great time to find a missing spot of the supply on the market and come up with an idea on what to build.    

Once you're over the rookie phase, it's time to discover the most powerful advanced SDKs that will make an innovation wonder out of your Solana dApp. Here are some tools that are worth giving a shot: 

# Jupiter API

Jupiter is the major DEX aggregator on Solana with a thriving governance community. It operates unique advanced routing algorithms enabling highly efficient SPL token swaps.

Utilizing Jupiter API web3 devs can access Solana liquidity the easiest way possible. Get a quote and swap easily with this powerful API. Perfectly suitable for building:

* DeFi platforms, 
* wallets with swap functions, 
* arbitrage bots that require efficient routing between token pairs, 
* Copy trading bots 

Jupiter API is your door to Solana's liquidity, and there’s no tricky lock to open it. Read till the end to know how.  

# Raydium SDK

Similar to Jupiter, Radium is also one of the core DeX protocols on Solana, which also provides an API for you to bring innovations to SOL ecosystem. Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM), that enables permissionless trading with the implementation of liquidity pools. Raydium provides a sweeping SDK for building dApps on top and swapping tokens at a lightning-fast speed. Radium SDK is your go-to tool when you aim to:  

* Create liquidity pools and enable token swap
* Build yield farming protocols 
* Retrieve data from Solana’s DeFis with ultra-low latency
* Leveraging Raydium’s AMM for token trading in wallets or dApps.

A must-have for developers looking to integrate high-speed swaps and yield farming into their Solana dApps

# Jito MEV Client  

Jito Labs provides a wide range of Solana MEV Software and products for end-users and devs alike. The core feature of Jito is a Miner Extractable Value (MEV) implementation, allowing the creation of additional earnings by optimizing a transaction order. It gains profit for validators, devs, and users.  However, MEV could also be dangerous in terms of market inequities and security. 

JITO maximizes the benefits and minimizes the drawbacks of MEV through a groundbreaking approach to it. As a Solana developer, you should definitely check out Jito if you’re building: 

* Auto trading platforms
* Telegram bots 
* Tools for validators 
* Staking and yield farming platforms 
* Memecoin sniping bots 

If you’re building anything that requires rapid and reliable transaction execution with MEV integration - JITO is your go-to tool! 

# Yellowstone gRPC Geyser Plugin

Yellowstone Geyser Plugin enables developers to use the gRPC interface for Solana. Yellowstone gRPC is a high-performance Solana plugin built around the Geyser interface supporting both gRPC and JSON-RPC protocols. 

It empowers developers to:

* Process large real-time blockchain data streams
* Monitor on-chain activities (e.g., token mints, smart contracts executions)
* Make API calls with minimal latency
* Build dApps and DeFi platforms with optimal speed and efficiency.

Yellowstone is one of the most demanded plugins for Solana development at the moment. So whatever you building - handling large data is crucial, especially on SOL, and super easy to do with Yellowstone gRPC. 

# DAS API

Built by Metaplex Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API represents a unified interface for eased management of Solana-based tokens including coins and NFTs. This API makes it possible to store some data partly off-chain which significantly optimizes the amount of data stored on-chain and enhances the speed of interaction with assets on Solana. Extremely helpful when you need to: 

* Reduce the amount of API calls
* Compress NFTs
* Optimize assets management process

DAS API is your go-to tool to keep in your arsenal when making NFT marketplaces, SocialFi platforms, DePin and RWA projects, DAOs, GameFi, and Metaverse Applications! 

# Bonus: ORE 

If your hardware and sanity are melting after numerous hours of mining BTC in vain, there's new innovative must-win mining on Solana for you to try! 

ORE is a Solana Program that provides a PoW mining interface and capabilities. Reshaping the approach to proof-of-work, ORE makes mining on the Solana network possible.  

Unlike Bitcoin mining, where everyone works on the same task but only one miner receives the prize, ORE provides personalized challenges for miners, ensuring that no work is in vain and everybody is rewarded. 

*Note that using ORE you’ll mine $ORE, not $SOL!* 

As ORE is an SPL token there’s much more you can do with it except just mine and HODL. You can build some add-ons and analytic tools for mining, integrate them into your DeFi and swapping protocols, create new tipping or payment systems, and much more!

# How to connect to them all at once easily

You can pick one or integrate them all and make your dApp almighty, but be ready that the setup process might take quite some time and bring many hassles. Not to mention that running a Solana RPC node is not a walk in the park. 

However, I found a solution that kills all birds with one stone. Check out the GetBlock - RPC provider. Their recently launched Solana PRO RPC is a powerful machine that contains a solid suite of APIs and add-ons and is being built specifically for a certain user, which means that it’s also super secure and flexible. 

Connecting your dApp to GetBlock’s Solana PRO RPC you gain access to all the needed tools at your fingerprint, including:

* **Yellowstone Geyser gRPC**;
* **Metaplex DAS API**;
* **Raydium SDK;**
* **Jupiter API;**
* **Jito MEV client;**
* **and even ORE mining interface** 

There’s also an option to set up the SplTokenMint and SplTokenOwner indexes to your Solana PRO RPC node and add almost any other extra API you need. Join me at the GetBlock Community and let’s expand the Solana ecosystem together! ",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835
Reddit,solana,Transfer of tokens from Token Account,2025-02-10 13:53:54,"Hello, 

  
I have received a message with a private key of a token account. They want me to think that I can access these funds and send them my own private key bla bla... (Of course I'm not gonna). But I'm wondering how do these token accounts work? It is said on the official Solana docs that every token account transaction also requires the signature of the Account Owner, no matter if it is an onCurve address or not. So you cannot make any transfers without the transaction being a multisig transaction with the account owner as a signer? Can any dev maybe chime in, I'm just wondering how these Token Accounts work in general coming from a different blockchain 😄. 

  
Thanks in advance",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835
Reddit,solana,"How is literally 99/100 coins, especially those on the latest list of DEX aggregators with >200k liquidity, almost always rugs?",2025-02-09 19:50:48,"I’ve been in this space for a while now, and I’m honestly just feeling so done. Every time I see a coin on the 'newest' list of DEX aggregators, especially those with over 500k liquidity and a volume of more than a million, I get this glimmer of hope like “Hey, maybe this is the one.” But no, it’s always the same damn story.

Somewhere between the first pump and the second dip, everything collapses. I can’t even tell you how many coins I’ve lost on that looked so promising at first, with huge liquidity, high volume, buying pressure, even distribution and low whales, and all the right hype. Yet somehow, they still find a way to rug. The liquidity disappears, the price crashes so fast you can’t even get out in time, and suddenly, you’re left holding nothing.

I’ve seen people talk about how “this coin is different”, but deep down, I know. I KNOW it’s going to rug, just like every other one. The cycle feels endless, and I’m honestly just tired of losing. I can’t even trust the DEX lists anymore.

The tx sent was identical for both and just contained a simple buy request to the pumpfun program on an inactive token. The time taken includes the time taken to receive the tx confirmation using the signatureSubscribe rpc method. Helius won here by ~148k nanoseconds which equates to .148 seconds. Chainstack also gave me a rate limit error for trying to query the token balance afterwards, so it seems their rate limits are more restrictive here.

Reddit,solana,Telegrams are the ultimate meme coin killer - change my mind,2025-02-10 05:59:38,"There is NOTHING more bearish than an unregulated TG chat. NOTHING. Now hear me out before you shred me. My ultimate opinion is that TG's should be made still, and the main reason for that is to prevent these scammers in [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) threads (for those who actually use the chaotic platform to find new memes instead of some sort of pump vision platform like BullX) from convincing people to go into their stupid scam TG channels with the scam re-verify bots. Otherwise, I'd say scrap the idea of TG altogether. However, that chat should always be muted, and communication regarding working for those bags should happen in an ongoing group VC if needed. Here is why:

1. FUD is a real problem for coins. As Alfred in The Dark Knight said, ""some men just want to see the world burn"". There seems to be a certain type of meme regard whose sole goal is to ruin other people's good time. They will say whatever they can in TG's to try to kill a coin. This is literally IN ABSENCE of looking for a lower priced entry. They literally just want to kill the coin. Those that are FUDding for entry are also scumbags. A muted TG chat eliminates that problem, while still being able to have the buybot spam going and the raid links. Anyone that has anything important to say can say it on VC, if it's important.
2. The V2 scammers and the fake Safeguard bot (that asks you to ""reverify"") are getting out of hand. Like 2 scammers a minute joining talking about ""DM me immediately"" and all that shit. And the scam safeguard bot keeps getting forwarded into channels. The consequences of this are huge, and not just for the gullible regard that gets scammed. If they manage to take control of any wallets or get people to send them all their tokens, they immediately destroy the token by dumping the token onto the chain and draining the liquidity. So anyone that is holding a significant enough amount to dent the liquidity pool that is stupid enough to get scammed can destroy the token.
3. Prevent the PVP that inevitably happens when someone isn't happy a chart isn't moving up fast enough, ultimately reversing the chart. I have no emotional attachment to any token, so if I join a TG and the vibe is shit, I'm dumping the token (or alternatively not buying). I know others do the same.

Overall, there's literally nothing accomplished by having a non-muted TG chat for any token. The literal best case scenario is no TG at all, to be honest, but the pumpfun scammers get handicapped when you link a TG to the token on launch. So the next best thing is a muted TG. And for the love of god please set your buy bots to a REASONABLE minimum buy.

One of the biggest coins is “fartcoin” . Im gen z but i never found that shi funny. Its jus cringe .

This cycle showed me that u can have all the money in the world and still be a cringe beta male. 

I never been envious or jealous of someone who has more . The way i think if u got more im tryna be ur friend ; learn from u and use u as motivation . 

But these type of people . I dont wanna be near u with a 16 foot pole.

Reddit,solana,Solana bots are printing money… but who’s actually making the profits?,2025-02-08 21:55:38,"Alright, I need to talk about this because it’s been driving me mad. If you’ve been in the Solana ecosystem for a while, you’ve probably seen those insane bot transactions flying across mempools sniping, MEV strategies, sandwiching, arbitrage. Feels like every day, there’s some fresh “bot made $X million in Y minutes” headline. But here’s the real question: who’s actually making this money? Because it sure as hell isn’t me.

I tried running my own bot a while back as thought I was about to print cash like everyone else. Spoiler: I got absolutely wrecked))) Between failed transactions, frontrunning, and just straight-up coding errors, I basically paid Solana validators for the privilege of losing money. Meanwhile, the big boys with deep pockets and optimized code are feasting. Even the simplest sniper bots need constant tweaking to stay ahead, and if you’re slow by even half a second, forget it) someone else already ate your lunch.

At this point, I’m convinced that unless you’re a dev with insane experience (or sitting on a pile of SOL to absorb failed trades), trying to DIY this stuff is just a donation to the network. Lately, I’ve been messing with Bananagun Bot as it just copies profitable traders automatically through Telegram, so at least I don’t feel like I’m getting dunked on by algo nerds 24/7. Not saying it’s magic, but it’s definitely better than my own attempts at playing bot wars, lol. 

What do you think of these ""bot"" trends? Has anyone here actually managed to build a consistently profitable bot from scratch, or is the real money just in copying the ones that already work? Are we just providing exit liquidity for the whales who already cracked the system?",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

NOVA bot recently released thier chrome plug in allowing nove to be used through the bullx neo platform.

Speed and fees are unrivaled. Paying nova fees and trading off bullx neo is amazing.

Right after this they were mass reported and at the same time sniperoo shills came out of the wood works. I'm assuming a lot of these shills from looking at thier reddit are just in it for refferal codes as the majority of them do not seem like successful traders and have no idea what they are really talking about.

I'm no genius. I make a living trading mostly worthless shit coins. My brain is probably fried from staring at dumb memes all day so maybe just maybe my thought process is out of wack here. But after the DWT fiasco and other bots who have rugged and shilled the same exact way sniperoo is doing with these refferals and spamming ads.

Really it comes down to why use an inferior bot. My back up bot is trojan or bonk after NOVA. Sniperoo literally isn't even on the list anymore. Wouldn't use it if all other bots crashed and I had no way to trade. Especially after thier horrible shilling marketing.

No I'm not a nova bot shill. My reddit is organic and I don't have refferal codes for any bots anywhere on my reddit or comments.

\- i wanted to add a part where it checks the social buzz and mentions of the token to give me an idea it if is something community backed, but the twitter API could be a problem there as i want this token check to run every minute

Can someone please explain to me how can I withdraw from my Phantom Wallet this CHF and or what is it actually?

I was informed that this is a ""stable coin"", but in order to withdraw it to an exchange(for example Binance) I need a certain number of Etherum in my wallet first, otherwise it will get lost and never come to an exchange.

Can anybody vouch for that or is it a scam?

Reddit,ethereum,Yield farming for beginners,2025-02-08 17:26:09,"Someone asked for yield farming recommendations yesterday in the daily and I thought I'd open a thread for it, because I'm sure more people are interested in that.

I'd love to hear experiences with and recommendations for:

* Protocols and projects
* Strategies for keeping track of deposits, moving funds where yield is good, avoiding tax headache
* Resources for learning

  
Protocols and projects I saw mentioned before:

* Aave
* Yearn
* Beefy
* Convex
* Pendle



Resources

* [https://defillama.com/yields](https://defillama.com/yields)
* [https://swap.defillama.com/?tab=earn](https://swap.defillama.com/?tab=earn)

  
I'll add to the lists, based on recommendations in this thread.

  
Personally, I think I'd like to do something with USDC. I want to split a smallish amount into a couple of different protocols, some low risk low yield and also some a bit more experimental. I'm ready to loose some of my money, I mainly want to try stuff out. I'm in Germany and ideally this will not make my taxes a complete nightmare.

Reddit,ethereum,Cheaper gas fees alone won't save ethereum. Innovation will.,2025-02-07 19:16:15,"Hey everyone, 

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Also there was a historically massive sandwich attack on 1/21, apparently worth ~800k. Not sure if this is related.  
I can't really find any articles anywhere about this, MEV I guess is still sort of niche.  

Has anyone else seen this?   
What's going on with Flashloan Arb that profits are down so much?

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,"Take the Orange Pill, Neo",2025-02-12 00:20:43,"Just want to tell people my story. I’ll be quick.

A degenerate told me about BTC in 2015…
 
I told myself it was a scam, then BTC went from a few thousand to 10 thousand.

When it dropped back down I told myself “I was right!”

Then BTC made its push to 30k, I said “let me take a look at this”

I decided there was a second best, and something else would replace BTC… duh! MySpace was replaced by Facebook!

So I spent thousands on shitcoins.

I lost, I learned, and I figured out why BTC truly is the only coin that matters.

It was mined and distributed fairly, no one knew how far it would go so no one hoarded it. It’s part of what gives it value (obviously 100 other reasons)

So now I’m 5yrs in to being fully committed, only buying BTC, and not looking at price.

I truly feel like I’m set for life (I make good money and only buy BTC) and I still buy because I see the market cap easily crossing 20 trillion.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin 2500: A Space-Age Op-ed,2025-02-11 23:09:37,"Many of us here share the thought that Bitcoin is the *end-game of money*; that Bitcoin will be for the next 5000+ years what gold was for the previous 5000.

Only five centuries ago, settlers began to venture across the Atlantic to *the new world.* I wanted to go through a little thought experiment into what Bitcoin will look like just five centuries from now, in the **year 2500**. A future where humanity has spread across the solar system, with settlements on Mars and beyond. **There are many issues that Bitcoin faces in this future**. Does Bitcoin succeed? How would it differ from the Bitcoin of today?

This post will deal a little more with the technical aspects and logistics of a multi-planetary Bitcoin network, so strap-in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is the inability to double-spend coins; the ability to rely on the blockchain as a source of truth. This hinges on the **security and synchronicity** of the blockchain. 

This works fantastic on Earth, as communications across the globe happen near instantaneously - *even at the speed of light*. However, that's not the case when we begin to think about distances in space. The time it takes for light (and any communication) to travel between Earth and Mars ranges from [3 to 22 minutes](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html) depending on where within our respective orbits each planet is. Between Earth and some of the promising moons of gas giants like Europa? over [45 light-minutes](https://spacecenter.org/meet-the-solar-system-europa/#:~:text=Europa%20is%20one%20of%20Jupiter's,45%20minutes%20to%20reach%20Europa). Let's not even get into interstellar space, where travel to the nearest star system is over [4 years away at light-speed](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html).

>**Why is a delay in communication an issue for Bitcoin miners?**

Imagine that you are part of the future colony on Mars and you want to mine Bitcoin. You quickly realize it is impossible. In fact, **mining Bitcoin anywhere other than Earth is impossible.** Why? Because it doesn't matter how fast your mining machines are if you are solving blocks too late. And as mentioned earlier, at 3-22 light-minutes away, Mars' distance from Earth is far enough that you can be multiple blocks behind *at light speed.* 

[No Earthly pool would accept your miner's hashes](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/from-rejected-to-accepted-tips-for-improving-your-mining-speed) if you are providing the solutions to those hashes a potential **44** minute round-trip later. 

In order for Martian Bitcoin miners to contribute meaningfully, a Mars-based mining pool would be one that can successfully compute enough blocks in the communication gap to outpace the Earth miners, thus having the longer and valid chain. *But wait!* This means that Mars would have successfully 51% attacked the blockchain. So let's not do that, and find another solution.

>**A potential space-age solution to Bitcoin mining.**

Because of the issues that arise with the speed of light, mining Bitcoin in the future will potentially need to be centralized in respect to location. It will be difficult for computers more than a few light-minutes away to meaningfully contribute valid hashes to the network. In fact, *your hash-rate's value scales linearly towards zero as your approach 10 light-minutes away*.

* **0 light minutes away?** Amazing, you can contribute to the network in near real-time and you have the full (approximate) 10 minutes to find the next block's solution.

* **5 light minutes away?** It's feasible to mine, except *your hash-rate is worth half as much* as someone that is 0 light minutes away. Why? because you have approximately half as much time to solve the block in the 10 minute space.

* **10 light minutes away?** Your hash-rate is essentially *worthless* because you will always be attempting to solve an old block. 

This is all theoretical of course, because if you are dealing with mining real estate at the light-minute scale, the energy usage of that compute would be astronomical - *literally.* 

One solution to this energy usage is a hypothetical megastructure known as a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere). An entity that would provide more than enough usable energy for such an endeavour, and it also would be localized enough to enable connected miners to meaningfully contribute to mining.

Maybe a [Kardashev Type II civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) is a little far fetched for our civilization in the year 2500, but anything is possible.

> **What issues would Bitcoin users face?**

Let's revisit that previously mentioned colony on Mars, and instead imagine someone wishes to send you one million sats via L1, the base chain.

How would you perform this transaction so that you can trust it? What if that Bitcoin is sent to a different recipient on Earth at the exact same time as it is sent to you on Mars, and you have no way of knowing for an entire block?

Well, it turns out that **we've already solved this problem on Earth** \- *to an extent.* All that you would need to do is wait for a certain amount of confirmations in order to ensure that your coins were not double-spent and that you are the rightful recipient. This solution works well on Earth, and can even potentially work on Mars.

Although this band-aid solution wont work forever. Those closest-neighbour star systems mentioned earlier are still **4+ lightyears away.** And we can't expect someone in the Proxima Centauri system to wait over 200,000 block confirmations for their transaction, right?

>**A potential solution for space-age Bitcoin users.**

Layers upon layers. That's it really. It's quite obvious at this point that 600,000 transactions per day (the limit of Bitcoin's base chain) can't support hyperbitcoinization tomorrow, let alone in 500 years when our population has continued to grow in size and in distance. 

It may be that each individual civilization has their own layer built upon the blockchain, and that transactions between civilizations must be settled on the basechain as a result. Mars may very well have their own rollup solution, wherein martian settlers are free to transact indefinitely between themselves - *their own lightning network*. Periodically settling back and forth between the main chain to top-up as needed. In this instance, you could accept that previously mentioned 1 million sats from your fellow settler easily because you need not be wary about a double-spend back on Earth, since it is agreed upon by the network that those sats are within your own layer, removing any light-speed communication issues.

>**Why does any of this even matter?**

It's very obvious that alternative stores of value will be worth much less in the distant future. Precious metals are found in abundance within asteroids in our solar system, and there are already ventures that aim to one day harvest these minerals. What value will precious metals have if we are able to capture a [single asteroid worth $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000](https://www.space.com/psyche-metal-asteroid-composition)?

**Physical store-of-value assets become worthless in an age of such abundance**, and thus Bitcoin, as a truly scarce digital asset will reign supreme. These aforementioned smaller logistical hurdles will just need to be resolved before then.

As I mentioned in a previous Op-ed on this sub, it's important for us to try to envision future problems that might arise with Bitcoin, irregardless of how far away they are. If we want to build a future-proof, resilient asset, we can not just be concerned with what issues may arise in the next decade. There are investors today that view Bitcoin as a cross-generational asset for themselves and their families. 

I wrote about this topic very briefly in my [Bitcoin 2048 Op-ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ijhcth/btc_2048_hyperbitcoinization_oped/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but it was a lot of fun envisioning Bitcoin in the far-future that I wanted to explore this idea more in depth.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR: Gold is worthless in the far future, but at least Bitcoin will still work.

Reddit,bitcoin,Just How Secure Exactly?,2025-02-10 21:35:21,"Bitcoin's network hashrate is reaching new ATHs. Breaking ***1 Zettahash per second*** has become so commonplace that it can escape our minds on just how insane that number truly is.

1 Zettahash, 1000 Million Terahashes, **1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10\^****^(21)****) hashes** is a number so unfathomable that we can take the security of Bitcoin's blockchain for granted.

Earth has approximately **10\^18** individual grains of sand across all of it's beaches and oceans.

>**Every single second, the amount of mining calculations collectively done by the network outnumbers the number of grains of sand on earth by a factor of one thousand.**

But it is so much greater than that. This is just the amount of hashes that happens per second. Let's extrapolate a little further.

If each block requires approximately 10 minutes of compute to find a solution, that means it takes approximately 600 seconds of this network hashrate to find a solution. That's over **600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000** hashes to find one single solution, or **6\*10\^23** **hashes.**

How big is this number? Well the number of stars in the entire observable universe is on the order of **7\*10\^22** **stars.**

>**Every single block added to the blockchain is protected by more individual calculations than the number of stars in the entire known universe by a factor of ten.**

Ok, lets do the hail Mary. How many hashes have ever been calculated for the Bitcoin network? Well using [historical Bitcoin hashrate charts](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate) and a little bit of calculus, it's easy to get a quick estimate!

As of February 2025, **5.45\*10\^28** **hashes have been approximately computed by miners since the dawn of Bitcoin.**

That's 54.5 Billion Exahashes, 54.5 Million Zettahash, 54,500 Yottahash, or **54.5** [**Ronnahash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_prefix)**.**

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoiners are the most prepared individualists for the potential economic collapse,2025-02-11 12:42:24,"*I made this post in r/singularity I think it is relevant here too.

**Jobs, Automation and Debt**

The argument is simple, the vast majority of the work force in the knowledge economy are in some kind of debt, student debt, mortgage, credit card debt and the list goes on. With technological exponential growth the majority of knowledge workers are about to lose their livelihoods.

The effect is probably going to be greater than what we experienced in 2008. It will be the great economic depression of this century. People can't repay the debts, banks collapse, and with that all the economy. The question is where is the line, 10% unemployment of knowledge workers, 15%, 20%?

With the collapse of the banks, as was in 2008, bailouts once again will be approved. By bailouts we mean printing fiat money out of thin air and giving it away, which eventually leads to hyperinflation.

So, mass layoffs are about to happen in in the next few years and with that we can logically expect collapse of the banks and hyperinflation. Which means collapse of the dollar/euro.

This is the transition period, and it is going to be hard. I really much hope I am wrong, but the logic says otherwise.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,bitcoin,Still feel awkward to display affinity towards bitcoin in public,2025-02-10 08:49:30,"
So i’ve been in the crypto / bitcoin space since 2017. Most of my friends know i like and follow bitcoin. I don’t mind discussing it in personal circles and acquaintances. 

However, i recently bought a copy of ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ and started reading it but i am uncomfortable reading it with its cover on display on public transport. 

I find it weird that after all these years, and so much mainstream acceptance for bitcoin, i still find it awkward to display my affinity to bitcoin coin in public. I feel people will judge me - for something not sure what.

Is it just me or is it true for most of you folks. When will this change.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835
Reddit,bitcoin,How do I transfer coins from a single address in an offline descriptor wallet?,2025-02-11 02:29:30,"I'm using Bitcoin Core. I have coins evenly split among 20 different addresses in an offline descriptor wallet. In the past when I wanted to use some coins I'd simply export the private key tied to one of the addresses in the offline wallet, then import it into an online wallet so I'm only ever exposing a small amount at once. However, for security reasons Bitcoin Core moved to descriptors, which no longer allow this.

Is there a way to accomplish this same functionality using a descriptor wallet? In other words, move the coins associated with a single address in an offline descriptor wallet to an online wallet, similar to exporting a private key tied to a particular address?",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What's up with these tap to earn tokens ?,2025-02-11 16:34:20,"
Lately, I keep seeing these ""tap to earn"" apps everywhere basically, you tap the screen, watch ads, or do random tasks to earn some kind of crypto or in-game token. At first, it seems like an easy way to stack up some extra cash, but after messing around with a few, I’m starting to think it’s mostly a waste of time. But at the other end we can even make money lol if good luck. 
I’ve noticed The payouts are tiny. You’d have to grind for weeks just to make a few bucks.
Withdrawal limits are insane. A lot of these apps won’t let you cash out until you hit some ridiculous threshold that most people will never reach.
Way too many ads. Half the time, you’re just watching endless ads for the chance to earn a few cents.
Some of them seem sketchy. A few apps never actually pay out, or they disappear after hyping up their tokens.
I feel like these apps are just farming user engagement and ad revenue while making it seem like you're earning something. Has anyone actually made decent money from one of these, or are they all just a trap? Curious to hear real experiences. Recently came accross tapswap. Before it was ton and midas yield which i tried . But kinda confused because So many are still coming in market.

3) I have been DCA BTC for the past 3 years, small transactions of $100 a week, sold everything! 
but one of the exchanges I bought from no longer shows me how many BTC I bought and at what price…

I can declare like this: I invested 10,000, I sell for 15,000…15,000-1000=5,000 profit and I pay taxes!  Or do I always have to report the details of each individual transaction, the dates, etc.?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Tether transfer from abroad, taxes?",2025-02-11 18:22:35,"Hi there, noob in crypto here. Sorry if my English is bad sometimes. 

Tl;dr in advance: What’s the taxation on receiving about $1800 worth of tether on average monthly, from my brother in Turkey to me in the US? 

Here’s my situation and I’m trying to understand what sort of taxation I might have to deal with. 

I have assets abroad (in Turkey specifically) but I reside in the US (non-citizen, legal resident) and I want to transfer my monthly passive income that I have back there to here. It’s not much, about $1600 to $1900 each month. Using the regular bank to bank transfers I end up using about $1200 or more in a year due to horrible exchange rates and the fees. So my brother who’s a crypto enthusiast suggested that I use this method: 

I send him my Turkish Lira each month, he buys tether and transfers it to me in the US, and I transfer that into my regular bank account. So  basically a transfer from my Turkish bank account to my US bank account through a longer but supposedly cheaper way. That part seems to be accurate, but I’m wondering what my obligations are in terms of taxes. As far as chatgpt tells me, since it’s a transfer within family it can be considered a “gift”, and if it doesn’t exceed the $18,000 annual gift tax exclusion, it’ll be fine. But it does exceed the $18,000 limit. So will I be taxed on the amount after that limit, or does the whole total of transfer then gets deemed not a gift and get taxed? Also other than that, is there anything else that I need to consider?

Many thanks in advance to all who try to help. Happy gaining to you. ",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin “A Financial Black Hole”,2025-02-10 20:59:49,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis’t podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles—expensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it’s “digital gold”? He’s not buying it. 

“Cryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,” Fama said. “They don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,” he concluded.""

*Is E. Fama right about Bitcoin being worthless, or is he way off? What do you think guys?*

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Your thoughts on the ""stable"" coin USDN",2025-02-10 19:19:50,"I recently came across a new stable coin called USDN offered by a decentralized exchange platform named Smardex. It appears that they have a feature which allows users to swap Ethereum and potentially USDT to their proprietary stable coin, USDN. This caught my interest, and I’m curious if anyone else has encountered this before?

What makes USDN particularly intriguing is their advertised 58% APR just for holding the coin in your wallet. This is quite an attractive proposition, and it has piqued my interest significantly. However, I am a bit cautious, as it sounds almost too good to be true. I would like to give it a try, but I want to ensure it's a sound investment and not something that might lead me into complications or unforeseen issues down the line.

From what I understand, there are two main avenues to acquire USDN: you can either mint new USDN coins or swap existing cryptocurrencies to USDN. The prospect of such high returns is tempting, yet it’s crucial to assess the reliability and legitimacy of Smardex and their offerings. Before taking the plunge, I would like to gather more insights from others who might have experience with USDN to determine whether it’s genuinely worth the risk, or if it would be wiser to approach this offer with caution.

Cboe BZX Exchange has filed requests with U.S. regulators to launch the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On February 6, the exchange submitted filings for four asset managers Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs would track the price of XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.
These filings notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about a proposed rule change. If approved, these would be the first XRP ETFs in the U.S.

Earlier, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved in early 2024.

Now, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who is seen as more supportive of crypto, there has been an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. Analysts believe issuers are testing what new crypto products the SEC, possibly influenced by a Trump administration, might approve.

I think we are now getting a lot of adoption and attention towards crypto . Many more expectations from other major exchanges like bitget and kucoin regarding etfs.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"The crazy world of crypto, It's only getting worse",2025-02-11 11:26:47,"  
Crypto has been through ups and downs but honestly since 2017 when layer two tokens for Ethereum took off and DeFi came into existence it's only gotten more wild.

  
I'd have to say at least the first part of what would be considered a fun meme coin project would have been DOGE at least one that really took off and became one of the most adopted token. This was back in 2014, and before that I would say most projects where legitimate cases of blockchain such as litecoin.

From there things fell rather quite for a while until 2017 when Ethereum layer two tokens really took off. This layer two token system opened up a lot of possibilities but it also opened up a lot of failed projects and yes scam investments.

From there we then moved into 2020-2021 with the introduction of Meme coins, DeFi and NFT a rather large growth in terms of amount of projects and people getting involved.

 Now we are in 2024-2025 bull run and we have a lot of the same crazy going on but at a whole new level. We have meme coin crazy, scams, rug pulls, DeFi hacks, Layer two token projects, NFTs, web3, gaming and more. It's gotten so big now that not everything goes up.

Do any banks where you live actually let you transfer fiat money via XRP? If so, do they refer to such transactions as ""wire transfers,"" ""XRP money transfers,"" or something different?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Polygon & the Super Bowl: From Reddit Avatars to Polymarket’s $14M Bet,2025-02-10 06:56:27,"Today I crossed with this interesting [Tweet ](https://x.com/p_petertherock/status/1888697925423055196)sharing data regarding the NFL Super Bowl on Polygon.

As you may know, two years ago Reddit had a Reddit Collectible Avatars marketing campaign for the NFL Super Bowl LVII and they gifted event related avatars to the users that claimed them. Like this one:

https://preview.redd.it/otzpr7cxe9ie1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c11a4bcb1012357f0045a9d85d05fa4b335dfe3

This whole event minted 2,124,854M Collectible avatars on Polygon Network. Unfortunately Reddit next year's Superbowl tried something similar but making them too expensive and not achieving that great success.

https://preview.redd.it/c8bpje8ye9ie1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cab97c93ac7dbe580b8c5584b3c01b2ac694c6c

This year unfortunately Reddit didn't organized any kind of Superbowl Reddit Collectible avatars related event but this time we have another protagonist, Polymarket.

Polymarket is making Polygon once again the center of the action in this Super Bowl LIX with $14 million in active positions across 478 Super Bowl related markets.

https://preview.redd.it/8f4j0vcze9ie1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8ea4f64ae9bf83243e247b50eab8bb720ee9d0

Polymarket is having +$414M in betting volume as you can see in the image below.

Polygon continues to cement its presence at the NFL Super Bowl, and this time, it’s through **Polymarket**, the popular decentralized prediction market.

Polymarket is really gamblers paradise xD

With all of this I just want to show that Polygon has probably one of the most used real use of cases even if it is a casino and its bringing a lot of money and people to Polygon ecosystem building a unstoppable ecosystem that pushes adoption in crypto. And this is just the beginning because one AggLayer starts being operative it will be easier than ever to move money between layers to participate on fun dApps like Polymarket. Polygon is about to wake up.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why Everything Positive You've Heard About Crypto Is a Trick,2025-02-11 10:38:14,"
When you ask a crypto holder what they actually own in the amount shown in their wallet, they will likely say something like ""an asset"" or ""a store of value."" But that’s not true. The fact is, they own nothing. They hold a number but own nothing.

To understand why, let’s first clarify what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value.

Imagine you are holding 500 units of wheat. In this case, you don’t just hold a number; you own an asset. Why? Because wheat has the potential to fulfill people’s nutritional needs. It can provide direct benefits to people. Wheat itself stores the potential to provide that benefit. It stores value because it holds that potential. The number ""500"" is merely a way to express the amount of that stored potential. The bigger the number, the greater the potential.

Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you hold 500 dollars. This, too, is an asset. Why? Because the dollar has the potential to fulfill people's need to pay debt. Every dollar in existence enters circulation as a loan, either through a commercial bank lending money to individuals or businesses or through a central bank purchasing government bonds. These obligations create a real, tangible need for dollars. Individuals and businesses need them, and the U.S. government needs them.

Just as biology creates the need for food, the banking system creates the need for dollars through loan contracts, collateral, and government bonds. Debtors must acquire dollars to settle the obligations they signed. In this way, dollars store the potential to satisfy that need. The dollar itself stores value because it holds the potential to provide what is needed by the debtors in the U.S. banking system. If you hold 500 dollars, you own a specific amount of that potential to benefit debtors. The number '500' is simply a measure of this potential. The greater the number, the greater the potential.

The same principle applies to digital goods. If you hold a collection of music files, e-books, or software, you own assets because these things hold the potential to entertain, inform, or assist with tasks like writing or data analysis. They store value because they hold the potential to provide benefits to people. The more units of these digital goods you hold, the more benefits you can provide.

In the above examples, we saw what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value: it means holding something with the potential to satisfy people's needs and provide a direct benefit.

Now, let’s compare this to crypto. Crypto systems don’t have warehouses where they store wheat or any tangible goods. They don’t produce music, e-books, or software. They don’t issue loans, take collateral, or deal with government bonds.

What crypto systems do is assign numbers to addresses and record those assignments in a decentralized digital ledger. That’s literally it. This means that when you hold a number in your wallet, you don’t own the potential to satisfy people's needs or provide any benefit to them. All you do is hold a number.

If you hold the number 1, your potential to provide benefits to people is zero. If someone else holds the number 1,000,000, their potential is not a million times greater than yours; it is still zero. Both of you own zero potential to provide benefits to people. That’s why, by holding crypto, you don't own an asset or a store of value. And you certainly don't own money or currency, since those actually store value. Simply put, you hold a number but own nothing.

Crypto holders, recognizing they own nothing, resort to spreading false or misleading narratives in a desperate bid to offload their numbers and acquire assets. One such false narrative is about scarcity. For instance, they point to Bitcoin’s 21 million cap and call it scarcity. But scarcity applies to things that satisfy needs or provide benefits. If you limit the amount of wheat or dollars in circulation, their ability to fulfill people's needs remains. But in crypto, there is nothing that can satisfy people's needs; there's nothing to be scarce, just numbers on a ledger. Therefore, the 21 million cap is not scarcity; it is merely a mathematical rule limiting the sum of numbers assigned to addresses.

An example of a misleading narrative is the supposed simplicity and speed of crypto. This is often touted as one of its appealing qualities, but the reality is that crypto is fast and easy precisely because it doesn't manage any assets. Managing assets is inherently complex.

Take wheat, for example: it requires warehouses, packaging, transportation, harvesting, quality control, and distribution networks to ensure its usability. Dollars, too, involve a complex web of processes, from assessing creditworthiness to drafting loan contracts, securing collateral, regulating banks, and enforcing debt repayment. All of these processes exist because managing something that actually provides benefits to people is far from simple or easy.

In contrast, crypto systems only track which number is assigned to which address. And tracking numbers? That’s straightforward and easy.

Another false narrative is that value is belief-based, that something is valuable if people believe in it, and if they don't, it's not valuable. But belief cannot change the potential of something to satisfy people’s needs. Wheat still has the potential to provide nutrition, and dollars still have the potential to settle debts to banks, regardless of what anyone believes. That stored potential is value.

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

Reddit,crypto,A mnemonic system to (almost) effortlessly memorize 128-bit of entropy,2024-12-28 12:47:51,"Hi,

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

Reddit,crypto,Storing libsodium private keys on disk,2024-12-27 19:31:38,"Hi everyone,

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?  Thanks.",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835
Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Thanks",2025-02-12 00:52:41.529835

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause).
