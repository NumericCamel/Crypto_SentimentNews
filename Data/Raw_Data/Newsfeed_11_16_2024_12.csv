Dogecoin Whales Have Just Added 140 Million DOGE To Their Wallets As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Dogecoin whales have continued their buying push during the last 24 hours. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which keeps track of the total amount of DOGE that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, contains all investors who own between 1 and 10 DOGE. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Is Finally Back: These Metrics Point To An Explosion In Interest In the context of the current topic, the 10 million to 100 million coins group is of focus. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of this range converts to about $3.7 million, while the upper one to $37 million. These are clearly significant amounts, so the only investors who would qualify for this cohort would be the big-money ones. The group certainly doesn’t include all holders of this kind as the upper limit is ‘just’ $37 million, but it does the contain smaller of the whales, who are still an important part of the DOGE ecosystem. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution specifically for this Dogecoin group over the past few weeks: From the above graph, it’s visible that the Dogecoin supply held by these whales has been riding an uptrend recently, with a particularly sharp increase coming during the past few days, coinciding with DOGE’s massive rally. Considering this timing, it’s likely that these investors have been helping support the run. In the last 24 hours, the memecoin has seen a reversal in direction, with its price suffering a pullback of around 7% as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has registered a red day. Interestingly, despite the decline, the Supply Distribution for the 10 million to 100 million coins group has continued to head up. In total, these humongous investors have added a net 140 million DOGE to their holdings, worth almost $52 million at the moment. This accumulation naturally suggests that the whales don’t think that the rally is over just yet. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Co.

Analyst Forecast 2021-Like Rally,2024-11-16 11:00:00+00:00,"Cardano (ADA) has seen a massive rally in the last few weeks, surging over 81% in the past fourteen days. As the cryptocurrency continues breaking past key levels, a renowned crypto analyst highlighted its potential 2,000% climb. Related Reading: Analysts Bullish On Dogwifhat (WIF) $5 Target As Price Retests $4 Resistance Cardano To Hit $6 By Q3 2025 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez forecasted that Cardano might hit the $6 mark by September 2025. Earlier this year, the analyst noted that ADA’s chart reassembled a pattern similar to 2020, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could experience a rally like 2020-2021’s bull run. Per the post, ADA broke out from its two-year consolidation in early 2020 before retracing 75% and consolidating for most of the year. By November 2020, the token bounced from the accumulation range and started its massive 4,000% rally, which lasted around nine months. This year, Cardano has seen a similar move during the first leg of the cycle, reaching its year-high of $0.81 before retracing 75% and consolidating between the $0.6-$0.27 price range for the last eight months. Following the crypto market’s recent rally, fueled by Trump’s victory in the US elections and the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce interest rates by 0.25, Cardano has experienced a massive 50% weekly surge. Martinez previously forecasted that ADA could experience the second leg’s initial jump on November 18, around two weeks after the US elections. However, the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $0.6 support zone and broke above the $0.65 horizontal level earlier today. This performance represents an eight-month high for Cardano, which has been heavily criticized for underperforming against most altcoins. According to the chart, ADA might move sideways around this range for the following days before challenging its year-high price. If ADA continues replicating the last cycle’s pattern, the cryptocurrency could reach the long-awaited $1 by year-end. Additionally, it could surpass its previous $3.09 all-time high (ATH) by Q1 2025 before entering price discovery mode. Martinez suggested that Cardano could rise over 2,000% toward the $6 mark, reaching its top between July and September 2025. ADA Among Today’s Market Leaders While most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 move sideways, ADA has soared 21 % in the last 24 hours. The token surged as the third-best performer today, behind XRP and ALGO. Besides the general economic and geopolitical factors, its recent performance has also been fueled by speculation surrounding Cardano’s potential involvement with Trump’s administration. On Thursday, a member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the United Nations (UN), Shawn, shared on X that re-elected President Trump is exploring a federal voting and identity verification system based on blockchain technology.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Bears In Trouble: $800 Million Set For Liquidation If BTC Reclaims This Price,2024-11-16 10:00:39+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a tear recently, hitting multiple all-time highs (ATH) levels since Donald Trump emerged victorious in the 2024 US presidential elections. Although the top cryptocurrency has witnessed a slight pullback in the past 24 hours, rebounding to an earlier price level could spell trouble for the bears. Bitcoin Bears Could Be Under Trouble According to analysis shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X, more than $800 million is at risk of liquidation if the flagship digital asset reclaims the $93,000 price level. Notably, BTC’s current ATH stands at $93,477.  Related Reading: Binance Dominates As Bitcoin Futures Volume Hits New Peaks Amid Historic Price Rally At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $89,480, down 1.9% in the past 24 hours. On the 4-hour chart, BTC’s next prominent support level appears to be around the $86,000.  The digital asset has already tested this support level three times, and a further dip to this price could send BTC tumbling toward $81,600, its next major support. If BTC fails to hold above $81,600, a decline to $79,700 may follow. While a lower BTC price would favor the bears, a reclaim of the $93,000 level could severely hurt them. Such a move would risk over $800 million in liquidations, potentially forcing bearish traders to capitulate. Data from Coinglass shows that contracts worth more than $508 million were liquidated in the past 24 hours. Of this, $355 million were long, while $153 million were short. A recent analysis by prominent crypto analyst @CryptoKaleo suggests that Martinez’s warning for bears may be justified. According to @CryptoKaleo, BTC could retrace to $86,000 before embarking on another rally to set new ATHs – possibly beyond $100,000. The analyst stated: Just a little dip and a bit more ranging then send to $100K+. Honestly think this is the best case scenario for alts if we somehow get it. Would look for outperformance while BTC is accumulating around $90K. What’s Behind BTC’s Run? Multiple factors have contributed to BTC’s historic price action, including the halving earlier this year, the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising institutional adoption of the digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Surpass 1 Million BTC Holdings In Less Than A Year Since Launch – Details Inside However, Trump’s win in the 2024 US presidential elections – a result seen as pro-crypto – served as a major catalyst for BTC’s surge. Since Trump’s victory on November 5, BTC has climbed from around $69,000 to a high of $93,000, recording gains of more than 30% in just 10 days. Despite this impressive price rally, experts suggest that BTC may have further room to grow. For instance, a recent research report predicts that BTC’s bullish momentum could continue until mid-2025 when it is expected to peak. Additionally, relatively low profit-taking during this bull run could further propel BTC to new heights. However, bulls should remain cautious of a significant CME gap around the $78,000 level, which could be a magnet for price correction. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at $2.904 trillion, reflecting a 3.7% decline over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is at 60.97%, underscoring BTC’s continued strength in the market. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from X, Coinglass, and Tradingview.com",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit 5-Year Low—What Does This Signal?,2024-11-16 08:30:40+00:00,"The Bitcoin market appears to have taken an intriguing turn as the asset’s reserves on centralized exchanges have hit the lowest levels since November 2018. This development, highlighted by a CryptoQuant analyst known as G a a h, points out a notable change in BTC’s investor behavior within the crypto space and also suggests quite an interesting trend for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crosses $93,000 – Is There More Room for Gains or Are We Nearing a Peak? Bitcoin Reserves On Exchanges Reach Five-Year Low According to the analyst, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have diminished significantly throughout 2024, reflecting a shift towards long-term holding strategies among market participants. This trend suggests that investors increasingly transfer their assets to private wallets, reducing the supply available for immediate sale and contributing to buying pressure in a market already constrained by supply. According to G a a h, this behavior indicates a broader sentiment shift, with market participants displaying increased confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value amidst “economic uncertainty and rising inflation.” By moving Bitcoin away from exchanges, investors reduce the likelihood of sudden sell-offs, which can lead to increased price stability. However, the reduced supply on exchanges may also lead to heightened volatility, especially if demand continues to grow or remains consistent. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: With that said, this scenario signals a potentially more volatile but more resilient Bitcoin market, with less selling pressure and a growing dominance of long-term holders, which could open up space for new price peaks. BTC’s Upward Momentum Cools Off Following an all-time high (ATH) of $93,477 on Wednesday, November 13, BTC has faced quite a noticeable correction, now down by 4% from this peak. So far, the asset has been unable to continue its upward momentum and appears to be seeing more sell-offs. When writing, Bitcoin trades below $90,000 with a current trading price of $89,779, down by 1.4% in the past day. This price decline resulted in roughly $49 billion subtracted from its market capitalization valuation on Wednesday. For context, as of today, BTC’s market cap sits at $1.775 trillion, a nearly 5% decrease from the $1.835 trillion valuation two days ago. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume dropped from over $100 billion earlier this week to below $85 billion. Related Reading: Binance Dominates As Bitcoin Futures Volume Hits New Peaks Amid Historic Price Rally Besides the implications on its market cap and trading volume, BTC’s decline has significantly impacted a handful of traders. According to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours alone, roughly 170,215 traders have been liquidated, bringing the total liquidations in the crypto market to $510.13 million. Out of these total liquidations, Bitcoin accounts for $132.43 million, with the majority of the liquidations coming from long positions—those who bet that the upward momentum would continue.

Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast,2024-11-16 07:00:42+00:00,"Now that Bitcoin short-term price action remains bullish, driven by US President Donald Trump’s vocal support for crypto, analysts ponder the following question: How will Bitcoin perform in five to 10 years? For Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, using gold as a benchmark, Bitcoin can hit $800,000 in five to 10 years. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor In a Bloomberg Television interview, Novogratz joins other analysts on their bullish take on the top digital asset. He added that Bitcoin will remain upward and trade at $800k in the next five to 10 years, approximating gold’s $16 trillion market value. Bitcoin To Match Gold’s Market Cap: Analysts Trump’s win is arguably one of the triggers for Bitcoin’s recent price action. A few days ago, Bitcoin edged out silver in the list of Top 10 assets in the market cap department. Today, the digital asset tops Saudi Aramco on the same list, with a valuation of $1.79 trillion. With the continuous climb in digital assets, many ask if they match gold’s market cap. According to Novogratz, the shift in market interest among the new generation of consumers and traders is helping Bitcoin. He stated that today’s investors prefer Bitcoin, which is considered a digital store of value. Aside from Novogratz, other market analysts and industry personalities use gold as Bitcoin’s benchmark. For example, Howard Lutnick and Anthony Scarammucci have also compared both assets, saying that Bitcoin will beat gold’s market cap soon. Bitcoin To Trade In $500k Level If It Becomes Part Of US Reserve The Galaxy Digital founder also predicts that Bitcoin’s price will hit $500k if the US government decides to integrate the digital asset as part of the Treasury. Novogratz made this bold projection based on the current bullish trend and potentially favorable policies for crypto. Novogratz added that if the US decides to acquire up to 1 million BTC, then this will force other governments to invest as well, pushing the demand. In addition, Trump’s support for Bitcoin and crypto is also fueling the bullish run of the asset. Novogratz Not Confident On Government’s Decision To Add BTC As Reserve Asset Although Novogratz identifies a $500k target, he thinks the US Treasury will likely not add this asset. He predicts that there’s a considerable chance the bill may not pass the Senate’s approval, although the House gives its go-signal.

In the same Bloomberg interview, he further shared that he’s heavily invested in Bitcoin and will welcome the possibility of the reserve bill getting approved.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Why Is XRP Price Up Today? Key Reasons Explained,2024-11-16 05:30:55+00:00,"The XRP price is experiencing a significant uptick, rising 20% over the past two days and an impressive 47% in the last five days. The surge can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including speculation surrounding SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s potential resignation, favorable regulatory tailwinds under the incoming Trump administration, increased whale activity, and a notable technical breakout. #1 Speculation About SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s Resignation A primary driver behind XRP’s recent price movement is the growing speculation regarding the possible resignation of Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On November 14, Gensler delivered a speech at the Practicing Law Institute’s 56th annual conference on securities regulation, where he lauded the efforts of the SEC. “It’s been a great honor to serve with them, doing the people’s work, and ensuring that our capital markets remain the best in the world,” Gensler stated. The crypto community on Xinterprets this speech as a potential farewell address, especially in light of the upcoming transition following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Investors anticipate that the Trump administration will appoint a pro-crypto chairman to lead the SEC. “I will fire Gary Gensler on day one,” Trump pledged during the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, echoed these sentiments on X: “Joined Cantor’s annual Crypto Conference today – safe to say that the US is ready to be the crypto capital of the world with the next Trump Administration. Also an apt shirt to wear..on perhaps what are Gary Gensler’s last days in office?!” After Gensler’s resignation, there’s speculation that the SEC might reconsider its appeal against Ripple Labs, potentially alleviating regulatory pressures that have weighed heavily on the XRP price over the last years. #2 Regulatory Tailwinds For XRP Under Trump The anticipated policy shift under the incoming Trump administration is another critical factor contributing to the XRP price appreciation. The administration is reportedly preparing to adopt a more permissive stance toward crypto, with plans to appoint industry-friendly candidates to key regulatory positions. “Chatted with Tony Romm about how the incoming Trump Administration is already engaging proactively with the crypto industry on clear rules of the road… what a breath of fresh air!” Garlinghouse remarked today on X. Further emphasizing the potential positive impact, Garlinghouse stated via X: “I’ve shared some thoughts on what the Trump administration could mean for crypto and wanted to also recognize the XRP family’s patience and unwavering support. A lot has happened since XRP was the 2nd most valuable digital asset. It’s been – at times – a frustrating journey. ~6 years since the SEC started meddling in the crypto market, picking winners and losers… ~4 years since the SEC sued Ripple. He added, “Now FINALLY we see a light at the end of the tunnel as these external (frankly unnatural and manipulative) market factors fade. The tides are shifting, headwinds are turning to tailwinds, and the opportunity for those of us who believe in the future for XRP is enormous!” #3 Increased XRP Whale Activity Whale activity, indicative of large-scale investments by major holders, has also played a significant role in the XRP price surge. On-chain analysis firm Santiment reports on X: “Wallets with at least 1M XRP now hold a combined 45.61B tokens, their highest amount held since June 2018. In the past 2 years, whales & sharks have reversed course and accumulated 3.44B more XRP, a +8.16% increase. Traders have enjoyed a +40% return in the past 7 days.” #4 Technical Breakout Complementing the fundamental drivers are technical factors contributing to the XRP price action. XRP has broken above a six-year-long symmetrical triangle pattern, a significant technical indicator that suggests the potential for sustained upward momentum. Historically, such breakouts have preceded notable price increases, and in XRP’s case, the price had previously declined by as much as 97% during the formation of this pattern. At press time, XRP traded at $0.85. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention – Is More Growth Ahead? This steep surge inspired a new wave of enthusiasm among investors, both retail and institutional, as SHIB continues to prove itself to be more viable in the meme coin space. The upward rise of the coin sparked interest on X (Twitter), a site that has garnered over 41,300 postings mentioning SHIB in recent hours, keeping the speculation going. $SHIB ❤️❤️💥❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/k2TmXwhPil — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 13, 2024 Lucie’s Bullish Outlook For Shiba Inu Lucie, the marketing director of Shiba Inu, has been publicly vocal about her favorable assessment of the token, asserting that SHIB will soon achieve a price target of $0.00006. She recently emphasized SHIB’s exceptional lifetime performance in a tweet, which includes an astonishing increase of over 1.9 million percent against the dollar since its inception. The tweet created interest, and propelled SHIB to a seven-month high of $0.00003031 then sold off slightly, despite the fact that Lucie did not give an exact timeline as when this should happen. Her enthusiasm is contagious, and many investors are holding out at this point awaiting SHIB to continue on its upward trend, potentially reaching new heights to surpass its October 2021 all-time high of $0.00008616. Whale Activity Indicates Profit-Taking Opportunity Along with the price increase, SHIB has seen increased activity from large holders, or “whales,” who are frequently major market movers. Recently, a whale with the address “0xd6b” returned to the market after an eight-month absence, coinciding with SHIB’s recent advances. This whale, an early investor who previously profited $120 million from SHIB, transferred 100 billion SHIB, worth $2.81 million, to the Gemini Exchange. This move shows that the whale may be profiting from the continued rally. While such moves frequently foreshadow a possible cooling spell, they also indicate that significant investors are closely monitoring SHIB’s price behavior, which contributes to overall market sentiment. Looking Ahead: Could Altcoins Surge? As Shiba Inu maintains its recent momentum, the future is bright. While Lucie has cautioned that we may not yet be experiencing a full “Altcoin Season,” SHIB’s burgeoning social media presence and excitement over its possible rally suggest a shift in investor opinion. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor The anticipation of a breakout that can take SHIB up to new levels has left the investors quite bullish, and most are waiting for possible developments in the market.

The analyst further explained what to expect from the flagship crypto moving forward, having entered this phase of the bull run.  What To Expect From Bitcoin In ‘Thrill’ Phase In an X post, Ash Crypto revealed that Bitcoin is entering the thrill phase. Based on this, he told market participants to expect high volatility and more liquidation. Overall, the analyst remarked that the Bitcoin price trend will be to the upside as it continues to hit new all-time highs (ATHs). He predicts that BTC will rally to as high as $150,000.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Major Price Crash For Shiba Inu, But It’s Not All Bad News His accompanying chart showed that the thrill phase of the market cycle is when investors and traders may get overexcited about the bull rally and decide to go all in with leverage. However, as Ash Crypto indicated, this could go wrong since there will be a lot of liquidations during this period.  Despite this being a bull market, the Bitcoin price has, at different times, corrected after reaching new highs and flushing out over-leveraged longs in the process. Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Research, also explained earlier in the year that bull markets aren’t straight lines up and that significant price corrections are expected.   However, in the long run, the bears get the short end of the stick in a bull run as prices trend upwards. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that over $800 million will be liquidated if Bitcoin rebounds towards $93,000. This is a price level that BTC just reached two days ago as it rallied to a new ATH of $93,400.  The Bitcoin price has since corrected and dropped below $90,000. This was partly due to the US PPI inflation data, which was higher than forecasted. That development has cast some doubts about whether the Fed will be willing to further cut interest rates in December.  More Price Correction In The Short Term? Ali Martinez suggested that the Bitcoin price could experience further declines in the short term. In an X post, the crypto analyst said that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that Bitcoin is in overbought territory, which typically signals a potential price correction ahead.  Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1 This Bull Market This price correction could also happen as Bitcoin investors look to secure profits. Martinez revealed that $5.2 billion in BTC profits have been realized and that the sell-side risk ratio has surged to 0.524%. He warned market participants to stay alert and proceed with caution. Bhutan Government falls among whales that are already securing profits as they recently sold $33 million worth of BTC, just weeks after selling $66 million BTC.    At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,780, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Its break below this key level could pave the way for even greater losses, leaving traders to question whether the bulls can stage a comeback or if further declines are inevitable. As downside risks grow, this analysis aims to examine WIF’s recent drop below the critical $3.582 support level and explore the potential implications of this bearish shift for future price movement. By assessing current market sentiment, key technical indicators, and possible support zones, we seek to determine whether WIF is positioned for more losses or if a reversal may be on the horizon. Examining WIF’s Drop Below The Critical $3.582 Support Level On the 4-hour chart, WIF has recently broken below the $3.582 level, triggering bearish momentum as the price moves toward the $2.896 support range and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). As the bearish trend develops, the market is closely watching for any signs of stabilization or a deeper slide toward key support zones. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped from the overbought zone to 53%, signaling a reduction in upward momentum. This move toward neutral territory suggests that buying pressure may be waning, and market participants will be looking for indications of continued decline or a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Set To Skyrocket 2,500%, Predicts Renowned Economist On the daily chart, WIF is showing strong negative strength, highlighted by a bearish candlestick pattern that has pushed the price below the critical $3.582 support. This pattern indicates that sellers are firmly in control of the market, relentlessly driving the price lower, prompting a strong likelihood of further drops in the near term. An analysis of the 1-day RSI suggests WIF may face extended losses as it has dropped from a high of 80% to 64%, indicating a reduction in buying pressure. Typically, this decline points to a possible weakness of bullish momentum, with more downward pressure likely if the RSI continues to wane.  Potential Support Zones To Watch If WIF Continues To Drop If WIF continues to drop, key support zones to watch out for include the $2.896 level, which has previously acted as a critical point for price stabilization. Below this, the next support level to monitor is positioned around $2.257, where WIF may find additional buying interest. A break below these levels could open the door to further declines toward other psychological support zones. Related Reading: Strong Buy Signal For DogWifHat (WIF) – Key Indicator Hints At Rally To $4 Conversely, if WIF breaks below the $2.896 support level, it could signal the start of a bullish comeback, potentially pushing the price back above the $3.582 level and toward higher resistance points.

Gensler: 18 States File Lawsuit Against SEC Over Alleged Industry Persecution,2024-11-15 23:59:03+00:00,"For months, the cryptocurrency community has criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Chairman, Gary Gensler. Gensler’s aggressive regulatory approach has irked many in the industry, particularly the Ripple executives. Today, critics are taking Gensler to court over what they claim as the agency’s “gross government overreach.” Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor According to Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business, 18 states are already frustrated with Gensler’s management style, affecting the crypto industry. Republican attorney generals, including Kentucky’s Russell Coleman, are leading the lawsuit, arguing that the current SEC chair is bullying the sector. Lawsuit Argues That Gensler Is ‘Overstepping His Authority’ The states’ lawsuit reflects the growing discontent over Gensler’s approach to crypto regulation. According to Attorney General Coleman, the agency is trying to remove the regulatory authority away from states on cryptocurrency enforcement. 🚨SCOOP: 18 U.S. states have filed to sue the @SECGov and its commissioners, accusing them of unconstitutional overreach and unfair persecution of the #crypto industry under the leadership of agency chief @GaryGensler. The lawsuit, signed by 18 Republican Attorneys General,… pic.twitter.com/wxOovuIRQH — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 14, 2024 Gensler’s “regulation by enforcement” removes the states’ control over regulation and deprives them of the opportunity to define their economic policies. The attorneys further explained that the agency’s crypto crackdown is intense, aggressive, and far removed from its original mandate. According to the petitioners, Gensler’s management style is more about control than upholding the law or protecting consumers. The lawsuit aims to stop Gensler from aggressively attacking the industry and instead create clear and established rules for stakeholders. Gensler’s Long-Running Feud With Crypto The crypto industry currently sees Gensler as its enemy. Immediately after becoming SEC chief, Gensler led investigations and inquiries against the most prominent crypto companies. He has consistently argued that many companies work in “legal gray zones.” Ripple Labs, the developer of XRP, has a long-running feud with the SEC over the sale of its digital token. The regulator has argued that the company broke the law by selling tokens (XRP) without registering these as securities. Last year, Ripple Labs scored a court victory when US district judge Analisa Torres found Ripple’s XRP was covered by the country’s securities law when marketed to institutional investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Watch: 60% Rally Catches Whale Attention – Is More Growth Ahead? Gensler Responds To Crypto-Related Issues Gary Gensler recently broke his silence and defended his record as Chairman of the SEC during remarks made last Thursday. He emphasized that courts have consistently supported the agency’s actions aimed at protecting investors, rejecting claims that the SEC lacks the authority to enforce securities laws. However, with Republican Donald Trump winning the selections, Gensler may have a few options left. Trump has consistently signaled his support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and promised to replace him as SEC chair once he starts work in the Oval Office.

It would be great if you could tell the some tips that only daily memecoin investors know. The new narrative which I see is Crypto AI agents, and how to find coins related to these sectors, is there any way that I can protect my interests.

Reddit,solana,Massive Wallet Completely Drained: Beware,2024-11-15 01:29:59,"Crypto is not my main income, but I've been consistently investing for 4+ years.

Today I had my second largest wallet drained, my phantom wallet.

I'm a pretty precautionary person and hardly understand how this scam even works. This is how it happened.

I haven't been logged into that wallet for many months, it was holding sol, so I just held forever. But this morning I logged in to check the balance, because I knew that I'd made some pretty significant profits over the past couple weeks.

I noticed that when I logged in the balance was $74,000 something, but within minutes... $79,000.

I check my transactions and a wallet had sent me sol, so I clicked the official solscan link right inside my phantom wallet.

And boom, within a minute, every dollar was drained. The scammer left me with 11 bucks.

I still have no clue how the solscan link could possibly do this. And I'm not really sure what I could have even done differently.

These scammers are evolving rapidly, probably due to the power of these new AI softwares.

Either way, please let me know if anyone has any info on this scam. I'm really not sure what to do.",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

### 🎓 Midwest Blockchain Conference Recap

The [Midwest Blockchain Conference (MBC)](https://midwestblockchain.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org), held at the University of Michigan, gathered over 1,000 attendees, including students from 30+ universities, representatives from 40 blockchain companies, and 50 industry leaders. 

The event served as a space where blockchain clubs from across Midwest colleges and universities could connect and bridge the gap between talented students and blockchain companies. 

While this wasn't a Solana focused event, in the conversations I was involved in Solana was a hot topic. 

A good example of this was the packed house at u/adlonymous' [Intro to Solana](https://x.com/ttu_waa/status/1854965917232644523?ref=blog.colosseum.org) session.

I went to sessions on Sei and Sui right after and the attendance dropped off significantly. I'm not saying that to knock either platform, attendees have probably just heard more about Solana going into the event, but it does show the high level of interest in Solana. 

Colosseum made a contribution too as Nate Levine talked about student onboarding through hackathons, how some of the biggest projects got started on Solana, and how the Colosseum Hackathons and Accelerator help launch new projects.

https://preview.redd.it/ufnunpsfl51e1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=18337b405b5544f225cb887949f63aecd7e14a57

I did feel just a bit out of place as the ""old guy"" at an event aimed at college students, but I got to meet a lot of great people and become even more bullish on Solana seeing the next generation of builders learning and working together!

### 🍴 Minimum Fork Viability

Minimum Fork Viability (MFV) is a framework focused on building projects that aren’t just usable products but act as robust, adaptable foundations for future innovation. 

For Solana developers, MFV is about creating applications or protocols with the infrastructure, clarity, and flexibility needed to allow other teams to fork or build upon them effectively. 

MFV shifts the goal from simply creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to developing a foundation that others can extend, modify, or even reimagine.

It’s not just about making a functioning project but about designing it with future builders in mind. For Solana developers, this means creating dApps, protocols, and tools that can be easily forked, improved, and adapted, contributing to the overall health and growth of the Solana ecosystem.

Solana’s thriving developer community benefits when projects can be forked and adapted, creating an environment of rapid innovation. 

Forkable projects allow developers to customize for niche needs, improve upon core innovations, and contribute to a shared ecosystem. 

By providing detailed documentation and adhering to Solana’s best practices, you help other developers understand your contributions and make it easier for them to build upon your work.

By focusing on extensibility, robust documentation, clear architecture, and community engagement, Solana projects can become cornerstones of innovation within the ecosystem.

# Measuring Solana’s Decentralization: Facts and Figures

https://preview.redd.it/0h2h4e1wp31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3009e62379bfd72d319ac2a9bfc255deb8792fd1

## Actionable Insights

* The Solana network is distributed across 4,514 nodes, including 1,414 validators and 3,100 RPCs (epoch 685). No single validator controls more than 3.2% of the total stake.
* The Nakamoto Coefficient (NC) represents the smallest number of independent entities that can maliciously conspire to cause a liveness failure, denying the consensus needed for new block production. Solana's Nakamoto Coefficient is frequently cited as 19. The actual figure is likely lower since individual entities can permissionlessly operate multiple validators anonymously.
* Solana’s validator set spans 37 countries and territories. The largest concentration is in America, with 508 validators. Four jurisdictions each hold over 10% of stake: the US with 18.3%, the Netherlands and the UK, both at 13.7%, and Germany with 13.2%.
* 68% of stake is delegated to European validators, with 20% delegated to North America. 50.5% of stake is delegated to validators operating within the European Union (European stake excluding Norway, Ukraine, and the UK).
* The validator set is dispersed across 135 different hosting providers. The two leading providers are Teraswitch, a privately owned U.S. company hosting validators with a combined 24% of stake, and Latitude.sh (formerly Maxihost), a Brazilian-based provider of low-cost bare metal servers used by validators with a combined 19% of stake.
* The Agave client codebase has 357 individual contributors. The Firedancer client, developed by a small team under the leadership of chief science officer Kevin Bowers, currently has 57 contributors.
* The Jito client, a fork of the original Agave codebase that includes an out-of-protocol block space auction, currently holds a dominant 88% share of the network's stake. However, this is expected to change considerably over the next twelve months as the new Firedancer client is gradually introduced and integrated into the ecosystem. Solana and Ethereum stand out as the only Layer 1 blockchains currently offering multiple client implementations.
* Substantial changes to Solana’s core components undergo a formal and public [**Solana Improvement and Development (SIMD)**](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents) proposal process. The most significant protocol-altering changes, especially those affecting economic parameters, undergo governance votes. So far, three such votes have taken place.
* The Solana Foundation, established in June 2019, is a Swiss-registered non-profit organization dedicated to growing and supporting the Solana ecosystem. The SF’s relatively lean team of 60-65 full-time employees oversees funding for grants, staking programs, and developer tools.
* Additionally, there is strong evidence of geographical diversity among the Solana developer community. The most recent bi-annual hackathon, Radar, drew 13,672 participants from 156 countries, with notable participation from India, Nigeria, the U.S., and Vietnam. SuperTeam, a network connecting Solana creatives, developers, and operators, has expanded to 1,300 members in 16 countries.

## What is Decentralization?

Decentralization can be summarized as the lack of a single point of failure within a system. This multifaceted concept spans many dimensions, including token distribution, the influence of key figures, permissionless network participation, control over development, and software/hardware diversity. Quantifying a blockchain’s level of decentralization has few universally accepted standards outside of Balaji’s Nakamoto Coefficient. Many metrics are imperfect. Moreover, discussions around blockchain decentralization, often [**rooted in political philosophy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization), give rise to deeply ideological and, at times, almost religious debates.

Solana has been the subject of substantial criticism and misinformation from a vocal subset of the blockchain community regarding a perceived lack of decentralization and censorship resistance. A recent example being former American intelligence contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, who voiced concerns during a [**Token2049**](https://youtu.be/XD-XU6Y3TfA?si=E1IaejuCECQsIpjd&t=991) conference keynote presentation.

*“When you look back at the Bitcoin whitepaper, I think what you see is an adversarial approach to the system and that’s really what you have to be considering. A lot of people, and I don’t want to name names but,* ***Solana****, are taking good ideas and going, well, what if we just centralized everything? It will be faster, it will be more efficient, it’ll be cheaper… You have to be thinking for the adversarial case as opposed to the convenient, easy early case.”*

As with many of Solana’s critics, Snowden offered no data to substantiate his statements despite being [**publicly invited**](https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1841424790407520580) to do so. In the following sections of this work, we’ll analyze the decentralization of the Solana network through data, highlighting areas where the network demonstrates relatively strong decentralization while identifying areas where further progress is needed.

### Dimensions of Decentralization

With this report, we will take a quantitative and multifaceted approach to analyzing Solana’s decentralization, basing our analysis on facts and publicly verifiable information. 

We will assess the following areas:

* Distribution of stake
* Geographical distribution of nodes
* Diversity of hosting providers
* Client software diversity
* Developer diversity
* Governance processes and entities

‍When appropriate, we will compare Solana network’s metrics to those of other industry peer proof-of-stake L1 blockchains. Peer networks serve only as benchmarks, providing a broader context for Solana’s decentralization journey and highlighting areas where it may lag or outperform expectations.

‍**These comparisons should not be misconstrued as attempts to claim one network’s superiority over another.**

‍In many cases, Ethereum provides the most helpful benchmark as it is widely considered the most decentralized Layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain. It is worth noting that Ethereum is more than twice as old as Solana, with its genesis block produced in July 2015, compared to Solana’s in March 2020. Decentralization is dynamic, and blockchains typically become more decentralized over time. Given similar conditions, it’s reasonable to expect older networks to achieve higher levels of decentralization.

## Distribution of Stake

Stake distribution in a blockchain network refers to how the network’s staked tokens are allocated among its validators. In a well-distributed system, no single validator or small group holds a disproportionately large stake, reducing the risk of any one entity gaining undue influence or control over network consensus. 

‍A balanced stake distribution promotes decentralization by ensuring a diverse set of validators, making it harder for any malicious actor to compromise the network’s integrity. It also contributes to greater fault tolerance as the network becomes more resilient to individual validator failures.

‍*“You need a very large validator set, the larger it is on a gut level the network is more secure, but on the academic level, the bigger the set of nodes the easier it is to guarantee that honest nodes as a minority of that set always have a minimum spanning tree that can reach each other. That doesn’t even mean at the protocol layer; it’s literally people talking on the phone. The fact that people can get into Discord or IRC or call each other on a cell phone. That is us resolving a partition and figuring out what’s wrong. The more people we have, the easier it is for us to guarantee that partitions are impossible.”*

\- Anatoly Yakovenko, [**Breakpoint 2024**](https://youtu.be/wQNNsaFHnb0?si=n8Hc1gLQWtLWHZDf&t=578)

‍[**Running a node on the Solana network**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/how-to-set-up-a-solana-validator) is entirely permissionless, with a very low mandatory minimum stake (1 SOL) required to operate as a validator. The network natively supports [**delegated proof-of-stake**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/how-to-stake-solana) (dPoS) and consists of 4,514 nodes, including 1,414 validators and 3,100 RPC nodes. 

‍The largest two validators by stake are operated by Helius and Galaxy, each holding roughly 3.2%. The minimum delegated stake required to enter the top one-third superminority and top two-thirds supermajority is 4.4 million and 1.23 million SOL, respectively.

[ Above: validators ordered by stake, logarithmic scale ](https://preview.redd.it/znqncxt0q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=505bad9eb8fa1501602ed6b3fbceef1c554f21f4)

The chart below groups validators by delegated stake for added clarity. At the upper end, 82 validators (5.87% of the total) hold over one million delegated SOL. Conversely, on the lower end, 825 validators (59.1% of the total) have under 50,000 delegated SOL, with most participating in the Solana Foundation Delegation Program (SFDP), a program designed to help fast-track smaller validators to sustainability. Approximately 72% of Solana validators benefit from SFDP support, and these validators collectively represent 19% of the total stake. For an in-depth exploration of SFDP, please refer to our earlier Helius report: [**SFDP & the Challenges Facing Long-tail Validators**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-foundation-delegation-program-sfdp).

[ Above: Solana validators grouped by stake ](https://preview.redd.it/qcr3xlv2q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab007c98518c987e5655ce44b0e72f55246e509c)

Just as blockchain addresses do not equate to users, the validator count does not reflect the true number of distinct entities operating validators. The true number is lower as larger entities may chose to distribute their stake across multiple validators. For instance, Jito ([**1**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/J1to1yufRnoWn81KYg1XkTWzmKjnYSnmE2VY8DGUJ9Qv), [**2**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/J1to2NAwajc8hD6E6kujdQiPn1Bbt2mGKKZLY9kSQKdB)), Coinbase ([**1**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/beefKGBWeSpHzYBHZXwp5So7wdQGX6mu4ZHCsH3uTar), [**2**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/6D2jqw9hyVCpppZexquxa74Fn33rJzzBx38T58VucHx9)), and Mrgn ([**1**](https://stakewiz.com/validator/mrgn6ETrBDM8mjjYN8rbVwFqVwF8z6rtmvGLbdGuVUU), [**2**](https://stakewiz.com/validator/mrgn4t2JabSgvGnrCaHXMvz8ocr4F52scsxJnkQMQsQ)) operate several validators. 

‍There is no inherent issue with a single entity operating multiple validators; in fact, this could strengthen the network by increasing geographical and hosting provider diversity, provided the validators are distributed rather than collocated. However, risks may arise if these validators are configured identically with non-standard settings or firewall rules. Additionally, having numerous validators managed by a single entity on behalf of large companies or projects as part of a “validator-as-a-service” model could present further decentralization concerns.

### Nakamoto Coefficient

In proof-of-stake networks, the [**Nakamoto Coefficient**](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e) represents the minimum number of nodes required to control at least one-third of the total stake (i.e., the superminority). A higher Nakamoto Coefficient indicates a broader distribution of stake and, consequently, a higher level of decentralization. It can also be considered the smallest number of independent entities that can maliciously conspire to cause a liveness failure, denying the consensus needed for new block production. PoS and Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based blockchains require more than two-thirds of the stake to agree on the state of the network to continue transaction processing.

‍To determine the Solana network’s Nakamoto Coefficient, we rank validators from highest to lowest by their stake share and count the number required to control one-third of the total stake. Solana’s Nakamoto Coefficient has historically ranged between a peak of 34 on August 13, 2023, and a low of 19, where it currently stands. The coefficient has been relatively stable for the past year.

[ Above: Solana’s historical Nakamoto Coefficient ](https://preview.redd.it/31kncc25q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf0deaa9ba73aa911b15279f41c10038e6e0a992)

The Solana network's Nakamoto Coefficient ranks in the middle compared to industry peer networks. These numbers do not consider that individual entities are free to permissionlessly operate multiple validators anonymously, so the true Nakamoto Coefficients are likely lower.

[ Above: comparison of Nakamoto coefficients between various L1 blockchains ](https://preview.redd.it/qfsuk5s6q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6459be3ebdb729e1c062bc6d18f6c0a45cda442)

## Geographical Distribution of Validators and Stake

The geographical diversity of network nodes is essential for reducing risk and promoting network antifragility. When too many validators are concentrated in a single region, the network’s resilience becomes reliant on the regulatory frameworks of those specific jurisdictions.

‍Natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and tsunamis, pose another risk. Such events strain national power grids and can severely disrupt data center operations, leading to abrupt outages. Manmade threats, such as war, cyberattacks, and damage to critical internet infrastructure, including undersea cables, pose further risks that could endanger network stability.

‍Solana data for this section’s analysis was gathered from validators.app for epoch 685. The raw dataset is available in spreadsheet format [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DXVqbYuAF4I34Jp8QrSKVl0dyWzws3t3apZOZ_Vgkf0/edit?usp=sharing). These numbers reflect only staked validator nodes and do not include non-staked RPC nodes.

### Solana Validator Count and Stake by Continent

When grouped by continent, the data shows that 632 Solana validators (46%) are based in Europe, with 550 (40%) in North America. In terms of stake distribution, 68% of stake is delegated to validators in Europe, with 20% delegated to those in North America. 50.5% of all stake is delegated to validators operating within the European Union (i.e., European stake excluding Norway, Ukraine, and the UK).

https://preview.redd.it/cyaqgfx8q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f431e1224165563a8bf41e8f63400f8a985429f5

*Above: Solana validator and stake distribution by continent (map design:* [*FreePik*](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/worldwide-global-map-outline-black-background_68624434.htm)*)*

Comparatively, Ethereum has a similar distribution of stake with higher weighting towards North America at 34.4%.

### Solana Validator Count by Country

The Solana network's validator set spans 37 different countries and territories. The largest concentration is in America, with 508 validators (37%) operating from U.S. data centers, followed by 112 validators (8%) in the Netherlands and 111 validators (8%) in Russia.

[ Above: Solana validator count by country, epoch 685 ](https://preview.redd.it/9uq8pz5rq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0bbb4d36682c45b47631e0917e6afbe1420984b)

#  Geographical Distribution of Solana by Stake

This distribution is more balanced when weighing the validator set by stake. Four key jurisdictions each hold over 10% of stake: the US with 18.3%, followed by the Netherlands and the UK, both at 13.7%, and Germany with 13.2%.

[ Above: Geographical distribution of Solana stake \(epoch 685\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ydis03ftq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c19a676eaf0914e66a3505d8d32418b2fe40df3)

By comparison, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 83 different countries and territories, with almost half located in the US or Germany.

https://preview.redd.it/o0psj2bvq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd0f448f3b6c42f4b4a3029158da110b24992c9

*Above: Ethereum nodes by country (*[***source***](https://nodewatch.io/)*)*

### Top 10 Cities by Solana Node Count and Stake

A more granular analysis of validator and delegated stake distribution by city shows Solana validators are distributed across 121 cities worldwide. 

Specifically, for the United States, validators are dispersed across all major regions, encompassing 35 cities in total. The most popular are Chicago (124 validators, 2.3% of stake), Los Angeles (57 validators, 2.3% of stake), and New York (32 validators, 3.5% of stake).

https://preview.redd.it/dl2hwpfyq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8152a82db967693417dde68538d17b58685e0b13

 Earlier this year, Anza staff [**Rex St.John**](https://x.com/rexstjohn/status/1793744241207955735) proposed strategies to improve the geographic diversity of Solana’s validators, notably by expanding the presence of operators in the global South.

‍Several key challenges were identified:

‍**Higher latency:** nodes in remote regions face difficulty staying synchronized with the network.

* **Bandwidth cost:** some regions are notable for having a very high cost of bandwidth
* **Regulatory restrictions:** various jurisdictions impose laws that limit the feasibility of operating blockchain infrastructure
* **Underdeveloped infrastructure:** Insufficient network and data center infrastructure.
* **Unfavorable tax and tariffs:** high costs on hardware equipment.
* **Talent shortage:** a lack of local expertise in Solana and limited access to the capital required for staking

## Hosting Providers

The validator set should ideally be hosted across a broad spectrum of independent providers rather than relying heavily on a few centralized ones. This diversification is essential to reducing the risk of network disruptions or censorship from any single provider.

‍A notable incident in 2022 involved the German hosting provider Hetzner, which unexpectedly removed Solana validators from its services, taking over 20% of the active stake — around 1,000 validators — offline within hours. Despite this, *Solana remained fully operational without liveness issues*. Most impacted validators successfully migrated to new data centers within days, and nearly all delinquent stake was [**back online within a few weeks**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-march-2023).

[Above: the email notification sent to Hetzner customers instructing them to remove Solana client software from their servers](https://preview.redd.it/89t1d7s0r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7425e9fbe9acbe5867fc653a6d6dd35b107e4a81)

#  Solana Validator Hosting Providers by Stake

The Solana validator set is dispersed across 135 different hosting providers. The two leading providers are **Teraswitch**, a privately owned U.S. company, hosting 24% of validators, and **Latitude.sh** (formerly Maxihost), a Brazilian-based provider of low-cost bare metal servers used by 19% of validators. These two providers combined account for 43.4% of stake. 

‍Other popular hosts include the French cloud computing company **OVHcloud**, with an 8.65% share, and Lithuanian-based **Cherry Servers**, hosting 8.45% of validators.

[Above: validator hosting providers by stake](https://preview.redd.it/oz1spqm3r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=231b398b355ec3b4d2646fb37f97ba8c81049de7)

### Solana Validator Hardware Requirements

Because Solana is a high-performance, high-throughput blockchain, it has more demanding [**node requirements**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-nodes-a-primer-on-solana-rpcs-validators-and-rpc-providers#solana-node-requirements) than most industry peers. Hardware recommendations for Solana validators include the following key components:

‍**CPU:** 24 cores / 48 threads, or more, 4.2GHz base clock speed, or faster 

* **Memory:** 512 GB
* **Disk:** PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better, 2 TB combined or larger. High TBW
* No GPU requirement

‍In practice, Solana’s bandwidth requirements make home operations impractical, so validators are predominantly operated from bare metal servers in dedicated data centers. 

## Solana Client Diversity

Solana initially launched with a single validator client, developed by Solana Labs and written in Rust. While the Solana Labs client is no longer actively updated, a fork known as [**Agave**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/agave-2-0-transition) is currently in active use. Relying entirely on a single client implementation is a significant vector of centralization because it poses the risk of a critical software bug that could cause a liveness failure across the entire network. 

‍Increasing client diversity has been a top priority for the Solana community, and this goal is now finally being realized with the rollout of [**Firedancer**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer).

### Solana Client Implementations

Today, multiple Solana client implementations are either operational or in development:

* [**Agave**](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave): a fork of the original Solana Labs client, written in Rust and maintained by Solana software development firm [**Anza**](https://www.anza.xyz/#validator).
* [**Firedancer**](https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer): a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language maintained by [**Jump Crypto**](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/).
* [**Frankendancer**](https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer): a hybrid validator combining the networking stack and block production components of Firedancer with the execution and consensus of Agave.
* [**Jito**](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-solana): an Agave client fork built by [**Jito Labs**](https://jito-foundation.gitbook.io/mev/jito-solana/building-the-software) that introduces an out-of-protocol block space auction, providing validators with more economic incentives through tips.
* [**Sig**](https://github.com/Syndica/sig): a reads-optimized Solana validator client written in Zig by [**Syndica**](https://syndica.io/sig).

‍Additionally, [**Mithril**](https://github.com/Overclock-Validator/mithril) is a client written in Golang and developed by [**Overclock**](https://overclock.one/rnd/unveiling-mithril) to serve as a verifying full node with lower hardware requirements.

‍Having multiple full-time core engineering teams reviewing each other's codebases significantly boosts the likelihood of catching bugs while promoting knowledge sharing and collaboration.

‍*“We've learned a lot from the Firedancer client team; there are things that they've come up with that have been really clever solutions,”* noted Anza engineer Joe Caulfield in a [**recent interview**](https://youtu.be/dgqQHEbTdPA?si=j5FgYl4ChQGhUOiS&t=899).

‍Both Agave and Firedancer have significant [**bug bounty programs**](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/firedancer/information/).

### Solana Client Diversity vs. Ethereum

Solana and Ethereum are the only Layer 1 networks offering multiple client implementations. Ethereum has at least five major software clients. The most widely adopted are [**Nethermind**](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind), written in C#, with 45% usage, and [**Geth**](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), written in Go, with 39% adoption. 

‍On Solana, the Jito client currently has an 88% share of the network's stake. However, this landscape is expected to change considerably over the next twelve months as new clients — Frankendancer and Firedancer — are gradually introduced and integrated into the ecosystem.

[Above: Solana and Ethereum client diversity \(October 2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/0mqgij67r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8ee7eae4c46baf66815ded10fceb0e03383115e)

## Developer Decentralization

In *Quantifying Decentralization*, Balaji identifies developer decentralization as a critical factor for blockchain ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of minimizing reliance on individual contributors and reducing “key person risk.”

‍All core client software on Solana is hosted publicly on GitHub under open-source licenses, allowing for open access and community contributions. 

‍The Agave validator, maintained by Anza — a software development firm [**established**](https://medium.com/anza-xyz/meet-anza-a-new-solana-focused-dev-shop-7d92391d290b) in early 2024 — plays a prominent role in this landscape. Anza was founded with around 45 employees, roughly half of the team previously employed by Solana Labs. 

‍In addition to managing Agave, the Anza team contributes to the broader Solana ecosystem by developing initiatives such as [**token extensions**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/plug-and-play-token-extensions), cross-border payments infrastructure, and [**Solana Permissioned Environments**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/evaluating-solana-for-enterprise-use-a-comprehensive-guide#solana-permissioned-environments).

### Number of Agave Client Codebase Contributors

The Agave client codebase has 357 contributors and 26,408 commits, though raw commit counts alone are imperfect and do not fully capture the depth of individual contributions. Notably, a relatively small group of developers — primarily senior engineers and co-founders of Solana — have authored the majority of commits, with a long tail of smaller contributors.

[Above: commits to the Solana Agave client codebase by contributor. Dependabot is a dependency tracking\/updating bot.](https://preview.redd.it/e8fuhgo9r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08d4487798e8263f40b9f7fd8f215038704511c)

For comparison, Ethereum’s popular Geth and Nethermind clients demonstrate a similar pattern of contributor concentration within a larger community. Geth has 1,098 contributors, while Nethermind has 142. Over half of all commits to Geth are attributable to three core contributors. Likewise, two developers account for over 50% of all commits to Nethermind.

‍Number of Firedancer Client Codebase Contributors

The Firedancer client, developed by a small team under the leadership of [**Kevin Bowers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL_yJWI-kNI) at the prominent American high-frequency trading firm [**Jump**](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/), currently has 57 contributors and 3,722 commits. Contributor diversity remains limited given that Firedancer is a relatively new project — the first commit dates back to August 2022 — and became live on mainnet only recently.

[Above: commits to the Solana Agave client codebase by contributor.](https://preview.redd.it/ygjycv3cr31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab39d03615da71acb04b4d73a0726075a03db8a4)

### Solana Ecosystem Developers

Across the broader Solana ecosystem, there is strong evidence of geographical diversity among the developer community. Solana’s online bi-annual hackathons are some of the largest in the world by participation and play a large role in nurturing many of today’s most successful Solana protocols and applications teams, including Tensor, Drift, Jito, and Kamino. 

The most recent [**Radar hackathon**](https://www.colosseum.org/radar) drew 13,672 participants from 156 countries, with notable representation from India, Nigeria, the U.S., and Vietnam.

https://preview.redd.it/ny774q0fr31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4365122abd98f81c8d4876a3d24d5a581fa04935

Above: Radar hackathon registrations by country

## Governance

Governance is an important vector for decentralization as it determines how decisions are made within the network. This impacts everything from protocol upgrades to economic policies and community rules. Decentralized governance strengthens transparency, fairness, and trust in the network.

### Governance Voting and SIMDs

Solana Improvement and Development (SIMD) proposals are the formal documentation necessary for any substantial change to Solana’s core components. ""Substantial"" changes are defined as those that typically alter the network protocol, transaction validity, or interoperability. 

‍Non-substantial changes, such as minor code refactoring or objective performance improvements, do not require proposals. Proposals should document the rationale for the feature and enough documentation to understand the implementation. 

‍While submitting SIMDs is permissionless and open to any developer or researcher, most are submitted by client team developers working full-time on core protocol improvements.

‍There are two types of proposals: 

* **Standard Proposals:** affect core Solana features (e.g., consensus, networking, and API interfaces)
* **Meta Proposals:** address processes or guidelines outside the codebase

### SIMD Process

SIMDs typically progress through idea vetting, drafting, review, and acceptance stages. A formal review occurs publicly on GitHub, with the proposal author being responsible for gathering feedback from relevant core contributors, who determine if it is accepted, revised, or withdrawn. 

‍Authors are not obligated to implement their proposals, but it is generally suggested they do so as the best way to ensure successful completion.

‍If accepted, proposals often include an associated tracking issue for feature implementation and may require activation through [**Solana’s feature-gate mechanism**](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/wiki/Feature-Gate-Activation-Schedule). Feature gates are activated on epoch boundaries first on Testnet, then Devnet, before Mainnet activation.

‍Discussions on improvements span the following venues:

* SIMD ([**Solana Improvement Document**](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents)) Github repository
* sRFC ([**Solana Request for Comments**](https://forum.solana.com/c/srfc/6)) section of the official Solana forums
* The [**Solana Tech Discord**](https://discord.gg/solana)
* Disperse social channels, including X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram

### Solana Governance Voting Process

Significant protocol-altering SIMDs, especially those affecting economic parameters, undergo governance votes. The Solana governance voting process, a relatively new initiative spearheaded by longstanding members of the validator community, focuses solely on critical issues to maintain engagement and avoid governance fatigue. 

‍So far, three such votes have taken place:

* [**Initial Advisory Vote**](https://forum.solana.com/t/vote-first-governance-advisory-vote-by-validators/597/5) in October 2023 (14.3% stake participation)
* SIMD33 [**Timely Vote Credits**](https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-timely-vote-credits-mechanism-on-solana-mainnet/1179/20) in April 2024 (53% stake participation)
* SIMD96 [**Full Priority Fee to Validators**](https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-reward-full-priority-fee-to-validator-on-solana-mainnet-beta/1456/97) in May 2024 (51% stake participation)

‍Voting occurs via tokens deposited into each validator’s identity account, with each account receiving tokens proportional to its active stake in lamports. 

‍To cast a vote, validators transfer these tokens to one of several designated public keys corresponding to the available voting options, including an option to abstain. Once a vote is cast, it cannot be changed. 

‍In this structure, SOL token holders participate only indirectly by delegating their staked SOL to validators whose voting choices align with their values or preferences.

### Governance Benchmarking

According to a benchmarking report by [**CCData**](https://ccdata.io/research/esg-report-february-2024) released earlier this year, Solana is one of only four AA-graded assets among the top 40 digital assets evaluated for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards. The report's governance ratings, in which Solana was ranked fourth among L1 blockchains, assess factors including stakeholder participation, transparency, and the degree of decentralization.

### The Solana Foundation

The [**Solana Foundation**](https://solana.org/) (SF), established in June 2019, is a Swiss-registered non-profit organization dedicated to decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana ecosystem. With an initial treasury of 167 million SOL tokens, SF oversees [**funding for grants**](https://solana.org/grants-funding), its [**Delegation Program**](https://solana.org/delegation-program), and developer tools. It controls official brand assets, social media accounts, websites, and trademarks.

‍The Foundation operates with a relatively lean team of 60-65 full-time employees under the leadership of **Executive Director Daniel Albert** and **President Lily Liu,** supervised by the [**Foundation board**](https://zg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-436.843.713).

‍SF’s mission is to cultivate a scalable and self-sustaining Solana network, focusing on education, research, and ecosystem development initiatives. SF organizes large-scale Solana [**events**](https://solana.com/events), including [**Hacker Houses**](https://solana.com/news/2024-solana-hacker-houses-schedule) and the annual [**Breakpoint conference**](https://solana.com/breakpoint), to foster developer engagement and community building. 

‍The SF developer relations team maintains official documentation, social channels, and developer education. In January 2024, SF transitioned the management of the flagship hackathons to [**Colosseum**](https://www.colosseum.org/about/), a new independent accelerator co-founded by former SF Head of Growth [**Matty Taylor**](https://x.com/mattytay?lang=en).

‍*“Our job is to work ourselves out of a job. Find scalable ways to support the network and ecosystem and then get out of their way,”* noted Dan Albert at a [**recent debate**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri6d7FowWlg&list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&index=125), signaling SF’s long-term aim to establish a network that can sustain itself without oversight. 

## Conclusion

As outlined in this work, the Solana network’s decentralization is comparable to or exceeds that of its industry peers across numerous key metrics, including the Nakamoto Coefficient, geographical distribution of validators and stake, developer decentralization, and governance benchmarks. Client diversity remains a notable exception, which the new Firedancer client aims to address.

‍Several opportunities exist to enhance Solana's decentralization:

* Explore options to distribute the SF’s responsibilities across multiple organizations
* Increase transparency around Foundation spending and grant allocations
* Develop initiatives, such as ‘[**Solana Nations**](https://x.com/rexstjohn/status/1793744241207955735),’ to increase geographic diversity
* Reduce voting costs, which are the most significant [**expense for validator operators**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-validator-economics-a-primer)
* Explore strategies to reduce data egress demands on validators; these costs are notably high for operators outside the EU and US
* Encourage more active participation in governance voting
* Expand Solana's core contributor and research communities to strengthen the network's development

‍The validator set remains somewhat concentrated in the U.S. and EU and reliant on a limited number of hosting providers. While this challenge is not unique to Solana, it highlights the potential for Solana to improve as one of the less centralized blockchains on the validator level.

‍Many thanks to Overclock, Amira Valliani, Matt Sorg, Yelena Cavanaugh, Dan Albert, Tim Garcia, 0xIchigo, Anatoly Yakovenko, and Brady Werkheiser for reviewing earlier versions of this work.

Reddit,solana,How to get rich in memecoins (without trading):,2024-11-14 18:13:41,"
I get it, not everyone wants to gamble their money on random funny (or not) memes.

So here are 2 alternative ways of profiting from memecoins:

First way: DLMM Farming

I know, this sounds like some pro-level DeFi genius-only thing. But it’s not. 

What you have to do is simply provide liquidity for memecoins on Meteora and you will earn fees from people trading it.

Here’s how:

1. Go to the DLMM tab on Meteora
2. Pick a Pair: Look for low TVL, high-volume pairs. Balance risk with potential rewards.
3. Go to Add Liquidity
4. Set a Range: More bins = less risk, lower fees.
5. Choose a Strategy:
• Spot: All-purpose, easy.
• Curve: For stable pairs.
• Bid-Ask: Great for volatility.
6. Deposit your liquidity and start earning fees

This is NFA, please learn more about Liquidity Pools and Impermanent Loss before depositing.

Second way: Memecoin Branding Studio

Memecoins thrive on social media content, and that’s where the magic happens.

I’ve cornered Matt, founder of XD Studio—the genius behind viral content for top memecoins—and got him to spill the tea on how much you can earn creating art for memecoins.

Here’s what he shared (after a little persuasion):

Most deals are monthly, but individual prices are: 

• Animated GIFs - $100+, Art - $100-$200+.
• 50+ brands signed this year
• High 6-figure annual revenue

This business model is nearly perfect: it has little downside risk but a high upside potential.

Crypto companies typically pay more than other industries, allowing you to have way higher margins.

Hope this was useful.

Reddit,solana,Beware of This New Solana drain hack,2024-11-14 12:15:36,"⚠️ ATTENTION CRYPTO COMMUNITY & DEVELOPERS ⚠️

I just got drained on my main wallet. I need to share the story of this scam aimed at developers. 

I have been in crypto since 2016 and I have always been a relatively cautionary user. New scams are evolving rapidly. 

I was approached on LinkedIn for a web3 role as a backend developer. As a passionate junior web developer and crypto enthusiast looking for an initial role, I was very much intrigued. Here's how the scam unfolded:

• Initial Contact: The scammer reached out on LinkedIn and we started discussing a potential role in web3. They seemed credible at first, with a professional profile. 

• Code Test Requirement: They asked me to do a coding test by adding an API route to their Bitbucket repo. This was my first red flag, but my noob junior dev eagerness clouded my judgment. I jumped straight onto coding 🤦🏻‍♂️

• Malicious Code: I proceeded with the npm install command to be able to console log the server route working as instructed but the repo probably contained malicious npm packages and I did not pay attention then.

• Fake Interview: During what I thought was an interview, they asked me to connect my wallet to a site they were developing. I still knew it could be a scam, so i made him wait while I created a new chrome guest account to create a new metamask wallet from a new seed. Thinking in the worse case it would only drain an empty wallet, I used the guest account to proceed and click connect...

• Theft: Within an hour, funds started moving from my main metamask account and other sub-accounts. I immediately jumped on my pc to try to save what was being stolen, but could mainly only save around $2k.

• Despite my precautions, I lost around $5k, a significant part of my portfolio which I had been building since 2016. 🥲

• The scammer couldn't steal the funds I had staked with @Karak_Network as it takes 1 week to unstake. I have started the unstaking process today and would like to see if the Karak team would be able to do something here. If anyone else knows a way or solution to this problem, I would love to hear them 🙏

• The scammer couldn't neither sell my $cbBTC staked on @SolvProtocol as the redemptions are closed, but I fear that he might do it as soon as redemptions are available again. In this sense, would it be possible to do something to secure those funds ? Or else, id rather have you blacklist that address so the scammer can never withdraw them neither.

I know most of you will probably say that I am stupid, and you wont be too wrong.. 

I deeply regret how stupid I was and how easily I lowered my guard despite the many red flags my mind refused to pay attention to 🤦🏻‍♂️

 ⚠️ Red Flags 

• New web3 DEX company looking for a junior web dev
• Contact person making basic English mistakes, despite his supposedly professional profile and background
• Having to npm install a random bitbucket repo
• Interviewer not showing his face during the interview
• Asking me to click connect on his supposedly dev website
• Weird LinkedIn username in profile URL

Key Lessons & Advice:

• Verify Everything: Always check the legitimacy of job offers. Use tools or professional networks to verify the person's identity.

• Beware of Code Tests: Never execute code from unknown sources without thorough review, especially if it involves running scripts or installing packages.

• Secure Your Wallets: Even if using a new wallet for testing, ensure your main accounts are secured on hardware wallet and never disclose sensitive information or connect to unknown sites.

• Stay Vigilant: If something feels off, trust your instincts. Scammers are getting better at creating believable scenarios.

I'm sharing this story now, because I believe it could happen to anyone and miss-attention can happen very quickly.

I know I have been too gullible, and too dumb to think a dev job process happens like this but again my animosity to work as developer got the best of me. 

I can only have myself to blame for that.

I'm not asking for help but would rather hope this message can remind everyone to stay super safe during this upcoming bull, scammers are always lurking in the dark, imagining new creative ways to get your crypto. 

A retweet would help get @solvprotocol and @Karak_Network 's attention so they can examine the case and see if they can take actions to secure the funds.

Finally, if anyone is willing to help look into this case, I'm sharing the transactions that drained my wallet so we can try to have the scammer's address blacklisted:
 
- Primary Drained Wallet Address: debank.com/profile/0xea1b… 
- 2ndary Drained Wallet Address: debank.com/profile/0x0903…

The moment I scanned it, **everything in my account was drained** and sent to this wallet: `6Tt49Ww423YifiwbHzBR2rt7TjyanyTWmQtRbxfbAmEb`. I was using TrojanBot at the time, and I believe that's how they exploited me.

I feel so stupid for falling for it, but I also want to make sure no one else makes the same mistake. Be careful with anything that asks you to scan QR codes, especially linked to wallets or bots.

Reddit,solana,Bullx hidden fees: Taking a fix amount on every tx on top of the 0.9% they advertised.,2024-11-14 11:58:55,"I am done some researches.

>**I know what token account creations are**.

Bullx users are transfering a constant 0.002 SOL amount to the same address (**4o9p5PaYQcfNiLZCCN5ZsZckdtj6Up3xzLvSoZx8GufA**) on every tx they made, no matter the order settings they set. Some time it is 0.001 SOL, can't figure out why.

This wallet address (**4o9p5P...x8GufA**), makes thousands of SOL, and then swap it to millions of USDC, to be sent to other wallets.

If you are Bullxx user, you should be able to confirm that by checking any buy or sell transaction on solscan and display the legacy mode.

It might be a fee way to prioritise transaction, but if that is the case, they should document it and be more transparent about it. At the very least they should give this wallet a public name like pump fun does for their ""**Pump.fun Fee Account**"".

[Check last line](https://preview.redd.it/0e6rer0cvu0e1.png?width=2046&format=png&auto=webp&s=250b29457ca49219c78610789448cb356cc4fdc8)

\---

For those are still tempted to answer that it is the token account creation rent, here is a visualisation of how the token account works:

**Create token account with rent (\~0.002 SOL)** → **Receive tokens or use them (transfer)** → **(Optional) Burn tokens** → **Close token account to recover rent (\~0.002 SOL)**

You open a token account, which you own, then all the related token transfers are made with this account. Whenever you feel like it, you can burn the tokens and close the account to redeem the rent.

\---

If you have an other theory than me on those transfers, please provide source and/or proofs.

# EDIT:

I think I know what this is.  
Bullx used to use BloXroute like some other exchanges. So 0.001 SOL for every transaction.  
They most likely created their own BDN to cut out the middleman (around August 2024).  
The thing is that I can't find any trace of this online. If there is none again this lacks transparency.

For around 2 month they charged 0.001 for every transactions, and 0.002 since 30-40 days.",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

I’m trying to trade a small amount of SOL (around $15 worth) on my Coinbase Wallet, but every time I attempt to make a move with it, I get a ""low liquidity"" message that prevents me from completing the transaction.

I’m not entirely sure what’s causing this. I understand that ""liquidity"" has to do with how easily assets can be bought or sold, but I’m surprised that this is an issue even with a small amount like $15. I’d like to understand why this is happening and if there’s anything I can do to work around it.

So far, I’ve read a bit about options like:

1. Reducing the trade size.
2. Trying to increase slippage tolerance.
3. Using an intermediary token if direct trading pairs don’t work out.

Does anyone have experience dealing with this on Coinbase Wallet or any decentralized exchanges? Also, once I manage to convert the SOL, any tips on the best way to move it back to my bank account?

To be honnest I found the concept pretty absurd, but to help him monitor his real PnL (not the fake ones that don't take fees into account), I created a tool.

[It still needs some improvement but it does the job for now.](https://preview.redd.it/cr38n6awzq0e1.png?width=2278&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ee2d6e4eb956609bae2ece53f3c7edbd47fef3)

Working on this got me to spend some time learning about fees, with still a gray area one on those ""recurrent\_fees"", but I moved on.

Until today, when I started digging again, and this is what I have so far:

1. A constant transfer of exactly 0.002 on every transaction my friend does to a [mysterious address](https://solscan.io/account/4o9p5PaYQcfNiLZCCN5ZsZckdtj6Up3xzLvSoZx8GufA) **4o9p5PaYQcfNiLZCCN5ZsZckdtj6Up3xzLvSoZx8GufA**
2. A constant transfer of around 0.9% of to an other [mysterious address](https://solscan.io/account/F4hJ3Ee3c5UuaorKAMfELBjYCjiiLH75haZTKqTywRP3) **F4hJ3Ee3c5UuaorKAMfELBjYCjiiLH75haZTKqTywRP3**

With his his 854 defi activities, he sent 1,714 SOL to the first one. That might be nothing for some players but for him being a small trader, this is currently throwing money out of the window.

And the window is pretty wealthy: around 21 000 000 inflow transfers of 0,001 or 0.002 SOL to the first address, in 30 days -> [9 millions USD](https://solscan.io/account/4o9p5PaYQcfNiLZCCN5ZsZckdtj6Up3xzLvSoZx8GufA?flow=out&token_address=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v#transfers)

\----

Damn, I think I solved the mystery while writing this post ... I am kinda disapointed to be honest.

# To anyone wondering:

My friend is using **Bullx**

\- The amount around .9% is actually **Bullx** fees ([source](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/0xsloane/q/wtxD4MFquKiW/bot-swaps-by-bot-name-and-program-volume-qRxJ4G), [source](https://medium.com/@0xkryptokeisarii/bullx-bot-telegram-trading-bot-and-webapp-for-solana-af9ee4cf2c22))

\- The 0.002 is most likely from the bribe from the order setting, but I am not 100% sure.

But there is still a question without answer, what are they actually doing with this bribe money ? How to monitor its usage ?

So far I only see it turning into millions of USDC.

Reddit,ethereum,Non-Crypto Trader with a question,2024-11-08 22:43:30,"I am not a crypto trader. I do have a friend who is, though it's not a close acquaintance. They said if I wanted to try, I could download trust wallet, coinbase wallet, then send them my Ethereum address from in Coinbase wallet, fund my account through Trust Wallet, and they would use my Ethereum address to ""synchronize"" our accounts so that whatever trades they made, I would make automatically with whatever money I wanted to put in. (Say, 500 bucks for instance).

To me, this sounds extremely shady. They aren't explaining how they would sync our accounts, what method/program they use, etc. However, the average online search says sending someone an Ethereum address is generally safe. I just don't see how they could use that sole information to do what they're saying. If so, by what method?

I initially saw this as a harmless way to have a glimpse into what trading in crypto is like. But now I'm starting to feel as if there is a method of phishing/scamming of which I'm not aware, and I don't want anyone with access to my personal/financial information for obvious reasons.

If someone could explain to me how this works in layman's terms (ELI5) or whether this is a setup to grift money and/or personal info, I'd appreciate it! They're very annoyed by all my questions, which is part of why I'm so skeptical. Seems like there would be no reason to hide what they're doing or how if it was safe and legitimate.

Anyway, let me know what I'm missing, if anything. Or confirm what my gut says -- that this isn't a real thing, and someone is trying to see if they found a new mark.

EDIT: Thanks for the helpful (and expected) responses!  Like I said, I was never planning on getting into crypto regardless. Just not my bag, personally. I just wanted to learn about it, the equivalent of bringing $50 to Vegas but otherwise just seeing the sights. I appreciate the responses, because I have a more coherent way to say ""nah"" without making the overall social situation as awkward if anyone asks why I pissed this individual off.

Reddit,ethereum,I just realized a 2% validator effectiveness gap is costing me 0.1 ETH per year! (Math inside) 🤯,2024-11-07 15:47:14,"https://preview.redd.it/rjfk226r2izd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bd110d414df60e36f35f747241df88fa904fd3

TL;DR:

* Just analyzed Lido's validator data and found something crazy
* 99.4% vs 97.5% effectiveness = \~0.1 ETH difference per year (32 ETH stake)
* Not just simple math - rewards actually compound through multiple mechanisms
* Finally understand why DVT validators consistently earn more 🎯

Yo! 👋 Fellow ETH stakers,

Been going down a rabbit hole analyzing validator data (because that's what we do on Sunday nights, right? 😅). Found some mind-blowing stuff about how effectiveness REALLY impacts rewards.

The nerdy stuff first (I promise it gets interesting):

Basic staking math:

    Max theoretical APY = [base reward/epoch * epochs/year * 32 attestations] + block proposals
    = (4*10^-7 * 82,125 * 32) + ~0.5%
    ≈ 4.2%

But here's where it gets spicy 🌶️

Real rewards are affected by:

* Attestations (the bread & butter, \~95% of rewards)
* Block proposals (the juicy 5%)
* Sync committee rewards
* MEV (the cherry on top)

Looking at actual data from Lido's SimpleDVT validators:

* DVT validators: 99.4% effectiveness → 4.06% APY
* Average validators: 97.52% effectiveness → 3.74% APY

""But wait,"" I hear you say, ""that's just a 1.88% difference!""

NOPE. Here's the real impact on 32 ETH:

* 3.74% = 1.197 ETH/year
* 4.06% = 1.299 ETH/year
* Difference = 0.102 ETH 🤑

Why such a big difference? Because when you miss attestations:

1. You lose the base reward
2. Get slapped with penalties
3. Miss sync committee opportunities
4. Network delays snowball

The most interesting part? This data is from SSV-powered validators on Lido. Turns out distributed validation isn't just fancy tech - it's actually putting more ETH in people's wallets.

I mined eth for a while back in 2018 and 2019. Joined a pool and mined to an acct I setup locally with geth. Later switched to nicehash. Transferred some of my eth out to a coinbase account but still have approx 1.8 eth in there and haven't done anything at all with the acct since well before the switch to POS. Fired up geth a couple days ago to finally transfer my eth and realized of course my old geth couldn't connect to the network any longer and downloading a new version gives the error: ""Failed to register the Ethereum service: ethash is only supported as a historical component of already merged networks""

Ok so then it dawned on me.. I won't be connecting to the block chain directly like I did previously since I can't stake. What's the easiest way to transfer my eth now? Can I still locally connect to the network to submit a transaction even without mining or do I need to use some other service?

Lots of beneficial products could come from this; for example, in gaming arcades, hardware wallets could provide you with identity.

One of the problems with Ledger is that they are closed source, and as we found out not long ago—not really ""our"" keys, as they can export them (no thank you).

Reddit,ethereum,Market risk of a 51% attack on Polymarket,2024-11-02 22:18:06,"Over the past few days, I did a deep dive into Polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. Here’s what I’ve found:

UMA is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'Trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'Optimistic Oracle'. An 'Asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved ERC20 token) alongside the assertion. Anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'Disputer') may do so, typically by matching the Asserter's stake. If a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'Data Verification Mechanism' (DVM). When it reaches DVM, the tokenholders of UMA decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the Asserter or the Disputer receives the staked currencies). They do this with one vote per UMA token.

Polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with UMA. The API allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. The Polymarket API also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. If there is a dispute, it gets escalated to UMA's DVM system. Disputes rarely happen because the DVM works. Typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. This clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down.

However, the market cap of UMA is only about $200m as of writing this post. A 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. It is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of UMA could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on Polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the DVM for each of them, and win every bet. Doing this would destroy their $100m of UMA, but they'll potentially make more from the bets.

A quick browse of Polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). It's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on Polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. But a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""Presidential Election Winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ):

* Buy ""Yes"" on Chris Christie. $0.001. Buy 72 million shares right now for $72k.
* Buy ""No"" on Trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m
* Buy ""No"" on Kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m
* Accept the loss of $100m worth of UMA due to the price collapsing

**This would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** They could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. There's only about $670m of USDC on the Polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts.

At the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that Chris Christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on UMA.

There is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack UMA, and that would be to gain favor with Trump by using their 51% to decide Trump wins on the betting markets. It could be used to help the publicity battle that Trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election.

I would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on UMA, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). If anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. I'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%.

So, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. If UMA's market cap doesn't rise as fast as Polymarket's betting markets, Polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused.

While this month hasn't introduced significant changes in staking metrics, there's plenty of exciting work underway for Ethereum's future development. Preparations for Pectra are in full swing, and Vitalik Buterin has released thought-provoking posts on the potential futures of the Ethereum protocol.

Reddit,ethereum,18 days activation queue on Holesky?! Something big is brewing in ETH staking 🤔,2024-11-01 13:56:14,"https://preview.redd.it/kwfa1wk1payd1.png?width=2824&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf194f89d8043bde3deb46912a04e4eb4cbbaffb

Okay, this is weird. I just tried to set up a validator on Holesky testnet and noticed I'd have to wait 18 DAYS for activation. Double-checked the queue - there are [32,033 validators ](https://holesky.beaconcha.in)waiting. On a testnet! Something's definitely cooking...

What's even more interesting is that this massive queue started forming right after EIP-7002 (the beacon state root in the EVM proposal) hit the testnet. For those not familiar, this proposal essentially enables smart contracts to verify beacon chain state, which is crucial for many staking innovations.

Looking through some GitHub discussions and Discord channels, I've noticed a lot of activity around:

* DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) implementations
* Restaking protocols
* Liquid staking solutions
* New staking pool mechanisms

I'm particularly intrigued by the DVT testing activities because of the recent Lido simpleDVT and CSM discussions about implementing validator splitting into DVT solutions. Seeing projects like SSV and others actively testing on Holesky makes me wonder if we're closer to seeing production-ready DVT implementations than we think.

Anyone else noticed this unusual testnet activity? What do you think is being tested at such scale?",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869
Reddit,ethereum,Aggregation & atomization: dependency funding round dynamics,2024-11-01 18:28:23,"New article: Aggregation & atomization: dependency funding round dynamics

**>>>>>>>> read the** [**full piece**](https://trent.mirror.xyz/ia1sSXWw6Q_0gseWhPDpt0WbsOadCfQ-23yAxNn4sXA), summary below  
  
The term “public goods” has been diluted - “dependency” might be better. Round-based funding mechanisms incentivize atomization - how can we avoid this?

We have failed to develop standards of rigor for the use of the ""public goods"" term. When it applies to everything, it describes nothing. “Dependency” is better for the Ethereum software ecosystem: crucial bits of infrastructure not directly maintained by an actor.

Recurring Funding Rounds come with tradeoffs  
  
\- attention games  
\- eligibility scoping  
\- high expectations of evaluators  
\- atomization incentive

Reflecting on OP Retro Round 5  
  
\- incentivizing atomization  
\- Legibility is not impact  
\- Stewardship is less legible - for good reason  
\- Misconceptions about levels of PG funding

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,2024-10-31 14:25:40,"# Here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. 

**First a bit of context:**

I guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like MetaMask). So you don’t use crypto the way you’d use Cash App or Revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day.

But the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling YouTube, Instagram, or WhatsApp. So, if we want Ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. Plus most people in Asia and Africa are mobile-first. 

**Why do I even talk about it?**

So we've been building Kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. Our idea has been to stay open and Ethereum-aligned. This means that we haven’t set up “Sign in with Google” or embedded wallets powered by Privy, Capsule, and others. We haven’t even built an Android or Apple app - we have a PWA app so that everyone can use it.

Since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing Ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. But unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work.

I've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from Istanbul to LA and saw people getting onboarded to our app. They used Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask and many other wallets. 

Metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. Rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. Coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing.

And it’s not only Kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like Zora. Some just say: “Ah yeah, it’s normal. I will figure it out once I get in front of my laptop”. Can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances?

Last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753)

And it’s not that the Ethereum community doesn’t care about the UX. Vitalik even said at one of his talks: “We should be as decentralized and open as Linux and Android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as Apple.”

But if Steve Jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from AppStore forever.

Wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. You can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. But this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder.

And the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. But it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. And the whole idea is to have your ENS and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. 

The question is, why does it keep happening? Maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from Firefox, through Chrome up to Opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. But then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time?

If we had solved the Merge, I imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. But it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,ethereum,Best practices for Anonymous Crypto Payment System With User Tracking and Minimal Gas Fee,2024-10-31 08:42:02,"Hello! I'm looking to implement a crypto payment system where users can deposit funds without logging in—ideally through a simple QR code scan or by pasting a wallet address. However, I still need a way to track each user and monitor their total deposits. 
The main requirements are: 
1. Users deposit anonymously without requiring login. 
2. The system needs to associate each deposit with a specific user ID for tracking purposes. 
3. I want to know how much each user has deposited over time. 
4. Ideally, I’d like to minimize gas fees and avoid dust deposits. 

Questions: 
1. Has anyone implemented a similar system or found ways to make anonymous deposits work while tracking users reliably? 
2. When scanning the QR code in MetaMask, the metadata field appears empty. Has anyone encountered this issue, and is there a workaround to pass data reliably with the QR code?
3. Would using smart contracts be feasible in this context? If so, how could I reduce gas fees and avoid creating dust amounts? 
4. Alternatively, is there a way to generate unique deposit addresses for each user and avoid dust completely?",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

What I hate about this news source is you can guarantee they’re not going to cover how good of an investment this was for El Salvador, and wait until the next bear market to discuss all the negative stories of those who lost money in the space.

Here’s the FUD story from NowThis if you’re curious. The comments are hilarious to see now that Bitcoin is where it’s at now:

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin is my Retirement Bonus,2024-11-16 10:02:16,"I’m 15 years from retirement. I’ve been employed full time since graduating University with a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (no student loan) and during this time I’ve maxed out my company-sponsored retirement account up to the point where they match my contribution (ranging from 2x to 4x my contribution). I’ve also paid into Social Security, of course. Based on my calculations, I’ll be able to retire if I downsize my living expenses and lifestyle. I’ll be able to do this, but I won’t like it.

This is where Bitcoin comes in 😎 My time horizon is 15+ years, I’m DCA-ing with money left over after paying my bills (no debt) and enjoying life (vacations, gifts, experiences, stuff). If BTC goes to $0, I’ll be OK. If it continues to grow as it has, it will be worth more than my entire career’s retirement savings (x some multiplier!), which means my retirement will change from being just OK, yet enjoyable, to being very nice indeed. I see this as icing on the cake, a nice bonus, so to speak. Again, I’m enjoying life currently, living in the moment, and saving for retirement … and on the side, building my bitcoin stack for a potentially nice bonus when I retire.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin: The Revolution You Can’t Afford to Ignore,2024-11-15 23:28:17,"In a world where central banks continue to print money into oblivion, Bitcoin has emerged as a revolutionary alternative — not just as digital money, but as a force of decentralization. With inflation hitting historic highs and debt levels skyrocketing, the financial system is in dire need of a reset. **Bitcoin is that reset**.

What’s more, Bitcoin isn’t just a ""store of value"" — it's the ultimate escape from centralized control. While fiat currencies can be manipulated at the whim of governments and banks, Bitcoin’s immutable protocol ensures that it operates independently of any authority. It's based on a finite supply of **21 million coins**, creating an asset class that is immune to inflation and market manipulation. This alone makes it one of the most important financial innovations of our time.

The traditional banking system has failed many, especially in countries with unstable economies. Bitcoin transcends borders — in a world where access to traditional banking is limited, Bitcoin is an open-access, **borderless system**, giving the unbanked and underbanked a chance to control their own wealth. For people living in countries with hyperinflation or authoritarian regimes, Bitcoin provides an essential lifeline — not just for financial freedom, but for **individual sovereignty**.

Consider this: The global debt clock ticks relentlessly upward, while the purchasing power of the dollar continues to decline. Central banks have resorted to quantitative easing, a euphemism for printing money and increasing national debt. In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve alone has increased its balance sheet by 500% over the last decade. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s supply remains fixed. As the price of fiat currency continues to devalue, Bitcoin's intrinsic design ensures its value proposition only strengthens over time. Bitcoin’s **hard cap** means that it will never fall victim to the same monetary policies that have driven traditional markets to the brink.

The **volatility** of Bitcoin is a common argument used by critics, but here's the truth: volatility is part of the maturation process. As more institutional players (like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Fidelity), as well as individual investors, enter the market, Bitcoin’s volatility will continue to reduce. In fact, Bitcoin’s price tends to follow four-year cycles dictated by its **halving events** — each one propelling the price upward, especially when combined with growing adoption. With the most recent halving event in **April 2024**, Bitcoin is well-positioned to experience another significant rally in the near future.

Another aspect often overlooked is Bitcoin’s **proof of work model**, which makes the network not only secure, but also trustless. Every transaction is verified by thousands of independent nodes, making it impossible for any single entity to control or manipulate the system. This means **freedom**, not just in the sense of autonomy over your wealth, but also in terms of security and trust.

Now, think about what happens when Bitcoin becomes mainstream. We’re talking about institutions, corporations, and governments integrating Bitcoin into their financial infrastructure. When that tipping point is reached, Bitcoin won’t just be a speculative asset — it will be the backbone of the global financial system. And here's the key — **that tipping point has just begun**. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and BlackRock are already positioning themselves in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and adoption is accelerating globally.

It’s happening — Bitcoin is not a fringe asset anymore. It’s already becoming the default choice for those who want to escape the monetary chaos caused by irresponsible central banking policies. If you're looking for a way to protect your wealth, diversify your holdings, or assert your financial sovereignty, Bitcoin is the answer.

In the end, it’s simple: **Bitcoin isn’t just a currency; it’s a revolution** in how we view money. A revolution we can all be part of, right now, before the world catches on. So the real question is — are you going to wait until everyone else gets on board, or are you going to take control of your financial future today?

**Bitcoin is not just an investment. It’s freedom in your hands. Don’t let the moment slip away.**",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869
Reddit,bitcoin," PSA: Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins - A Hard-Learned Lesson ",2024-11-16 10:11:22,"Just wanted to drop a friendly reminder that hits close to home: **Not your keys, not your coins** isn't just some catchphrase – it's real advice that I really wish I'd taken seriously before losing money in the FTX collapse.

Keeping coins on exchanges is convenient. It's easy to trade, the UI is slick, and cold storage seems like a hassle. But remember:

* Exchanges can freeze your assets
* They can get hacked
* They can go bankrupt (thanks, FTX!)

If you're holding any significant amount of crypto, please take the time to:

1. Get a hardware wallet
2. Learn how to use it properly
3. Keep your seed phrase secure (not on your phone/computer)
4. Only keep trading amounts on exchanges

I learned this lesson the expensive way in 2022 and I'm feeling like this advice needs to be repeated now that the next bull is coming. Don't be like me – protect your coins.

Reddit,bitcoin,BITCOIN FOR TIME!,2024-11-16 05:35:49,"Yo, listen up Bitcoiners, I just had a freakin’ epiphany while pounding the pavement on my morning run through the streets of Fethiye, Turkey. 🌅 And I’m not talking about some weak “got an idea” moment. I’m talking a full-on bolt of lightning straight to the brain ⚡️.

So there I was, sweating my guts out, and it hit me—money, my dudes, is a straight-up scam. It’s like trying to hold sand in your hands: always slipping through your fingers, losing value year after year. And let me tell you, hyperinflation in Turkey? It’s real AF. But even the almighty US dollar? It’s basically on life support. 🚑

So while I was dodging stray cats and kebab stands, I thought, “If the USD is crumbling, what chance does the BRICS meme-currency even have?” Spoiler: none.

💥 Then it hit me like a freight train—Bitcoin is THE only real answer. It’s the ONLY thing that makes sense as a world reserve currency that actually holds up. Unlike the USD or whatever the BRICS gang tries to cook up, Bitcoin is bulletproof against manipulation, dilution, and inflation. 💣

And here’s the mic drop moment: Bitcoin is the only way to store your TIME. Think about it—time is the one thing you can’t print more of, can’t inflate, can’t “stimulate” with BS policies. It’s the hardest, realest asset on this planet. ⏳ We all get our finite slice, and once it’s gone, it’s game over.

So why the hell are we letting our precious time be compensated in fiat toilet paper that’s losing value faster than your ex’s Instagram followers? 🚀 We should be demanding our wages in the hardest damn money on Earth.

🔊 BITCOIN FOR TIME! 🔊

Time is priceless, my friends. Stop trading it for fiat trash that depreciates faster than a Lambo on a gravel road. It’s time to wake up, stack sats, and secure the bag.

Reddit,bitcoin,Falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.,2024-11-15 11:06:39,"I have yet to share my personal Bitcoin journey, but I believe now is the right time to do so. It marks the beginning of my descent into the Bitcoin rabbit hole and, much like the Bitcoin White Paper itself, my story is closely tied to the financial crisis of 2008. 

This account is deeply personal, laced with self-pity and a sense of stupidity. That's why I've kept it private and not even shared it with my closest friends, but I think it's important to share it now with you. Giving back to a community I received so much in the previous years. All too often, those who fall victim to the shortcomings of the fiat system internalize the guilt, unaware that they are being taken advantage of by a corrupt fiat system.

My parents, hardworking individuals who dedicated their lives to building their own business from scratch, had little time to acquire financial education. In the early 2000s, they were advised — like many companies and individuals in Austria — to finance their company/house with a Swiss franc loan. The arrangement was complex and opaque, involving multiple loan accounts and significant commissions for both the bank and our financial advisor. My parents, trusting the system, unknowingly became entangled in a speculative gamble, exacerbated by the euro's introduction and the franc's relative strength over time. It turns out that debt in a strong currency and income in a rapidly depreciating currency have only one outcome: Default over time.

As a result of the financial crisis of 2008, the Swiss National Bank could no longer suppress the upward pressure on the franc in 2014 and the fallout was inevitable. Overnight, my family faced a substantially larger loan burden than initially anticipated, to threaten us to file bankruptcy and lose everything we worked for in the previous decade. This devastating turn of events — driven by corrupt banking practices and greedy financial advisors — left an indelible mark on me. As a young man, witnessing my parents' hard-earned savings and efforts eroded by a system they trusted was enough to cement my distrust of financial institutions forever. At this point in time I made a promise to myself: Trust no one, educate yourself and verify.

A few years later, I discovered Bitcoin. It clicked immediately. Here was a decentralized, incorruptible solution to the very problem that had caused so much pain for my family. Bitcoin represented a chance to opt out of a fiat system riddled with perverse incentives and predatory practices. My family's experience — our suffering under the weight of a corrupt financial system — motivates me to advocate for Bitcoin adoption. For this reason, I will never trade my Bitcoin for fiat currency ever, no matter the fiat price. It represents more than wealth to me; it’s a symbol of resilience and justice, a way to honor the sacrifices my parents made.

Looking back, I am almost grateful for this painful chapter of my life. It woke me up and set me on a path I might not have found otherwise. Many people experience similar losses at the hands of the fiat system without even realizing it because the theft happens incrementally, through inflation and hidden costs. Fact is, that honest, hardworking individuals are being robbed every day — second by second — by a system designed to erode their purchasing power over time. Like my parents, but more gradually.

While it’s exciting to see Bitcoin’s fiat price increase, that is not its ultimate value. Bitcoin represents so much more. And I know, many others who HODL Bitcoin not for fiat wealth but for deeply personal reasons — reasons rooted in justice, independence, and freedom. For those of us who have been wronged by the current system, Bitcoin is not just an asset, it’s a revolution for a better future.

Yours forever thankful, Carl. 🧡",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Let me start by saying I am a citizen of the world, French nationality, living in Thailand currently with bank accounts in USA and Hong Kong.

I've been looking to diversify my investment portfolio and buy some crypto to hold for long term. I started doing some research and finally downloaded Binance.

I was planning to fund my Binance account, buy some bitcoin and then learn to transfer them to a cold wallet and hold onto it for the next 10 years or so.

Problem is, the only options I see available to fund the account is by credit card with some crazy rate or go through the P2P where all the offers have different drawbacks.

Came onto here to see if any other international expats ran into the same problem and what exchange platform you managed to use for the lowest fees?

I’m a relatively new investor to Bitcoin despite knowing about it for years, a few months ago I deep dived this sub and orange pilled myself which I’m very thankful for.

I can’t, for the life of me get a good night sleep because I’m up every couple of hours checking price, checking sentiment on various websites, checking back here to see if Saylor bought more, waiting for the news to properly catch on about the BTC Reserves supposedly happening in the US and hopefully game theory after that. 

I feel like I’m going fucking crazy. My sleep cycle is completely fucked, and the sleep that I do get isn’t deep or REM, it’s shitty light sleep that I’m half conscious for. My sympathetic nervous system is throwing shots of cortisol and adrenaline at me for hours upon hours while I’m in bed trying to fall asleep, with fucking red/green candles and percentages fully occupying my frontal cortex  

Don’t get me wrong, I love making money, but how do you guys detach your brain from your wallets when it comes time to sleep? How do you make peace with the volatility of Bitcoin and let yourself go for 8/10 hours without knowing the price to get sleep? 

I’m hesitant to seek sleeping pills because that shit is addictive, melatonin in ineffective with me and I’m currently on Magnesium supps which help a bit, but they don’t ultimately address the underlying problem (being my chattering, bitch of a brain) 

What methods/therapies do you guys use for reprieve? 

Edit: removed numbers

Edit 2: The overwhelming sentiment here is I’m over invested in BTC… that may be true. However, BTC is around 20% of my net worth, so I feel like if it went to 0 (figuratively of course) I could stomach a loss of 20% of my NW. I’ve just never been involved in a global market, that is truly global, and open 24/7, and subject to influence by all countries, localities and announcements from everyone, everywhere. I believe in Bitcoin, I’ve read enough anecdotal pieces to understand the technology and I know it’s inevitable. My time horizon is years, BTC is BTC although it’s difficult to fully convert my mind to that train of thinking when I can’t yet pay my daily expenses in BTC. This is just a rant at this point but to those who say to adjust my time horizon out, I think that’s the play. Thank you.

How do I give her clear instructions on how to react in case I won't be able to cash out?

I thought of walking her through all the procedures, but I'm afraid it could be too much for her.

I also thought of leaving written details on a password protected usb stick or creating a legacy video in which I explain everything step by step. I plan on storing the video on a password protected usb stick. She will be the only one that has acces to the usb stick and its info

I now store some of my holdings on an Exchange and most of the bag is in a cold wallet, passphrase protected.

3. Recover your funds

I thought it would be fun to create a website that not only shows the current price of Bitcoin but also updates dynamically to show what 10,000 BTC are worth today and how many pizzas you could buy with that insane amount. **Spoiler: it’s a LOT of pizza now! 🍕💸**

The idea came to me because I always found that story fascinating. It’s a crazy reminder of how much the value of Bitcoin has grown, and I wanted to bring that to life in a fun and visual way. But the project is still evolving, and I’ve got plenty of ideas for where to take it next. One thing I’m considering is a way to monetize it a bit — nothing too intrusive, just maybe partnering with some brands or products. For example, we could feature different items and show how many of those you could buy with 10,000 BTC. It’s a cool and creative way to show the purchasing power of Bitcoin, and it might be fun to collaborate with brands who want to showcase their stuff in a unique way.

Anyway, it’s all for fun right now, and I’m just enjoying building something that gives people a laugh and maybe teaches them a bit about Bitcoin along the way. The site is definitely a work in progress, and I’m still adding features and refining things. I’d love to get some feedback or ideas if you have any! Here’s the link if you want to check it out: [Link to the website](https://btctnd.com/10000). Let me know what you think ! 🙌",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

I know its very hard to predict BTC as its always moving. Securing profits is one thing but for example this rally went from 60k to 93k, I sold at 83k bought back in @ 93k - in profit but now down 200$ cause its down a bit. Looking at the graph right now its a falling wedge breaking to upside. Next test is 93k - if it reaches 95k by end of week amazing. This is all a prediction I don't think anyone can predict BTC.

At the same time crypto never did me dirty holding...ever, I've been holding for awhile, I converted some coins to others and made the mistake, but mainly hold BTC, this time I just don't want to see myself down ""X"" amount of dollars during the correction...but I know FOMO is a human trait as well.

But I still work with people that know I'm into it and I guess they're hearing more about it on the news with it being a talking point in the election. A coworker I see every day seems to be able to grasp why a finite resource or currency or anything is going to go up in value compared to something printed out of thin air (like dollars, for instance). But he can't understand why bitcoin is finite since it's a digital currency. I've tried to explain it's designed that way, the system works autonomously, etc. He's not grasping it and and doesn't seem to want to try to understand. We've since agreed to disagree on it but he brought it up again yesterday as if he's still trying to wrap his head around it. I didn't really try to go through it again. I hope he didn't get the idea it's too late to get some, not that he really cares. I'm guessing he's had his mind made up the whole time. My question is how do some people put it together so quickly and others stay planted in bitcoin being too good to be true in what it promises? It's not rocket science, or is it?",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869
Reddit,bitcoin,It's Going Up Forever Laura. This is Why...,2024-11-14 23:03:10,"In the realm of finance, a profound shift is underway, challenging traditional notions of value and scarcity. Bitcoin stands at the forefront of this revolution, redefining our understanding of money and its role in society.

The dollar's value decreases over time, incentivizing debt and consumption. However, Bitcoin presents an alternative, promoting financial discipline and encouraging users to save or ""Hodl"" (hold on for dear life). This paradigm shift raises fundamental questions about the nature of value, scarcity, and the human relationship with money.

Bitcoin's finite supply of 21 million coins sparks an intriguing paradox: infinity divided by anything still equals infinity. This concept challenges traditional economic thinking, inviting us to reconsider the relationship between value, scarcity, and abundance. 

As the global economy evolves, Bitcoin's significance will only grow, fostering financial freedom and empowering individuals to redefine their relationship with money.

With a market capitalization of $2 trillion, Bitcoin has ample room for growth, considering the global GDP exceeds $100 trillion and continues to rise. The asset's value transcends time, boasting a maximum supply of 21 million coins. However, estimates suggest around 5 million coins have been lost forever.

If Bitcoin becomes global currency, its price per coin will skyrocket. On the Bitcoin Standard, prices decrease over time. For instance, a house once costing 100 Bitcoins now costs just 6 Bitcoins.

Ultimately, Bitcoin represents the intersection of infinity and finitude. As the saying goes, ""Infinity divided by anything still equals infinity."" Bitcoin guarantees possession of finite, infinite value through its 21 million supply. By holding Bitcoins, one possesses a piece of all present and future value. 

₿ = ∞/21M  or  ₿ = ∞

You aren't bullish enough. None of us are.

# Let's talk Moon Burns!

Now that Moons are on both Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, Moons are burned on both chains.

Between October 14th and November 11th:

* 10,527 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in four unique burn events:

* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is: 42,862 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Despite being new to Arbitrum One - Moons are the 12th most valuable asset in the dead address on Arbitrum One. With almost 80K Moons currently worth over $11,635 having been burned on Arbitrum One so far. Unlike almost every other asset in the Arbitrum One burn address - No Moons were ever minted for the purpose of being sent to the Dead wallet.

[https:\/\/arbiscan.io\/address\/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead](https://preview.redd.it/nvlh3hyp331e1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbd1d1a7daba949f7adcaee1c35b5df81c6325ab)

On Arbitrum Nova - Moons remain the number 1 asset is the Dead address with 2.718M Moons having been burned (Currently worth $392K)

This means between both networks \~2.8M Moons have been burned to date!

# 2024 Moon Burn Milestone!

In this update Moons have hit a special Milestone for 2024 that I'm excited to share with the community.

At the start of the year **80,293,585 Moons** were in circulation (excluding the Burn address). As of today a total of 812,771 Moons have been sent to the burn address so far in 2024 making our current circulating supply of Moons 79,480,814.

**That means the circulating supply of Moons has dropped by 1% so far in 2024!**

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Kraken just closed my account and stole all my money,2024-11-15 22:22:01,"https://imgur.com/a/bCNdQXy

I made a small transaction to an individual in Cuba of $50 that is legally allowed called a ""donative remittance"".

https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/732#:~:text=Donative%20remittances%3A%20Effective%20June%209,Government%20of%20Cuba%20or%20prohibited

https://www.wola.org/analysis/remittance-restrictions-what-it-means-cuba/

The transaction was to allow a non-sanctioned private individual to buy food and other basic necessities in an area that is currently under extreme famine. There are hundreds of websites and physical stores across the US that allow these remittances to take place. For Whatever reason this transaction was flagged by OFAC and I have to submit documentation or whatever to release the transaction.

HOWEVER.... Kraken decided it is upon them to close my account and prevent ANY further release of funds. They are keeping the rest of my balance of $250 for their personal purposes (thank heavens I did not deposit more) This closure has nothing to do with OFAC and they wrongly directed me to them for the rest of my balance which they are keeping. Upon correction, they cease all further contact with me.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,So many temptations to FOMO in a market like this.  So many people talking about moves you could make.  Here's a reminder to take your eyes off the charts and HODL.,2024-11-15 23:46:32,"With the recent surge to $90k and counting, it's clear the bull is back, and social media is starting to buzz with bull market hype, shills, and FUD.  For those of us who have seen a cycle through in the past, this is nothing new.  We all know it's only going to get more intense as crypto gets on the news, Grandpa asks about Bitcoin at Thanksgiving, and millions of newbie investors flood the space looking to FOMO their life savings into whatever the latest meme coin is.

The crypto space will soon be completely euphoric.  It will seem like no matter what you buy, you can't lose.  People will make stupid amounts of money by placing risky bets on alts and meme coins.  You might feel jealous and be tempted to sell your BTC to buy dog farts.  I won't tell you what to do with your money, but I will tell you that while dog farts can indeed produce epic profits, typically those bets are placed too late in the game.

Here's a cautionary reminder to avoid the hype.  It may seem tempting to make a big move; buying, or selling.  Don't fall for FOMO.  If you can handle the risk of buying halfway into a bull run, there's nothing wrong with continuing your DCA.  And if you don't want to risk going further, there's nothing wrong with starting to take profits.  But for the majority of us, assuming you invested your lot sometime in the last year and a half...

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Dynamic DCA Exit Strategy + Risk Metric Tier List
",2024-11-16 10:36:52,"9 months ago I created a Post about Dynamic DCA as a buying strategy and tons of people found it useful.  
With BTC surging past the previous ATH, there's been a lot of questions about exit strategies, so I thought I'd create a quick guide and share a tier list of risk metrics (both free and paid) that everyone can use for dynamically DCAing **out** of the market.

**Dynamic DCA Explained:** This approach is about adjusting your investment based on the current market conditions. Unlike traditional DCA, dynamic DCA is more flexible. You still invest at a fixed schedule, but you buy more during times of low risk / corrections and start holding or even **scale out during peak bullmarkets** by using metrics / looking at indicators and adjusting the DCA-out amount based on them.

**But why?** This approach yields much higher returns. At the same time, it helps a ton with the emotional turmoil. Setting a strategy to take profits during bullruns and sticking to it is a godsend when the greed hits. It also helps with the emotional side when DCAing out of the market. It feels stupid to sell the same amount at 90k and 140k. You obviously want to take advantage of changes in the market.

**Here's how I do it**

1. **Select a Risk Metric**: This is crucial. A good risk metric helps you understand the current market conditions, whether it's overbought (high risk) or oversold (low risk). The more accurate the metric, the more powerful your strategy. None of these will be perfect, but they'll be useful.
2. **Set Your Risk Thresholds**: Decide the risk levels at which you'll sell more, do nothing, or even buy back. For example, I start selling when risk goes above 70 and increase the amount I DCA out in steps of 5. So I'll sell 2.5% at 70 risk, 5% at 75 risk and so on - while keeping a core position of 55% that never gets sold.
3. **Stick to it**: Keep an eye on the risk metric each time your DCA time comes around and adjust your sell amounts accordingly (or follow the notifications depending on what you use).

Now, onto the tier list of risk metrics. **This list is based on my personal experience and research over the past 3 years. I've posted this before and it's largely similar.**

**S Tier**

* **AlphaSquared's Risk Metric** ([AlphaSquared](https://alphasquared.io/)): Still my go-to metric. It's been the most accurate during the late 2021 peak and 2022 bottom, nailing everything so far. It also offers a strategy builders and backtesting.
* **Benjamin Cowen's Risk Indicator** ([IntoTheCryptoVerse](https://intothecryptoverse.com/)): Solid choice with a wide range of metrics and a build-your-own-chart workbench. It's pricey, and has been a bit less accurate, but if you can afford it and value the other premium content, it's worth a shot.

**A Tier**

* **CoinTalksCrypto's Bitcoin Bull Run Index** ([CBBI](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)): Free and customizable. It didn't manage to nail either tops or bottoms so far, but it has been readjusted so maybe it'll fare better this time. It's mainly here because you can tweak the inputs if you trust yourself to make that judgement and because it's free.

**B Tier**

* **~~Bitcoin Risk Level~~** ~~(~~[~~Bitstack~~](https://risk.bitstack.se/)~~)~~ Seems like this has been discontinued!
* **LookIntoBitcoin's Reserve Risk** ([LookIntoBitcoin](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/reserve-risk/))
* **TradingView Scripts** mimicking Benjamin Cowen's model. There are a ton.

**C Tier**

* **Fear and Greed Index** ([Alternative.me](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)): More of a sentiment gauge than a risk metric. I find it less useful for dynamic DCA, though extreme greed readings can be a helpful secondary indicator.

That's it! I'm sharing this because I KNOW this will be useful for many, judging by the recent posts on here. Just to make things clear, Dynamic DCA-out isn't about timing the market perfectly. It's about making informed decisions based on market conditions, having a plan and scaling out over time and risk (because you can't time the market). You adjust your exit strategy based on the current market state, day by day, as you should.

Feel free to share your experiences or any other tools you find useful for dynamic DCA-out. Maybe I missed some new indicators in the meantime.",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

This comes on the heels of SomaXBT's Twitter investigation of Mr. Beast's projects involving cryptocurrency tokens.

Both Coffeezilla and SomaXBT have spent endless hours watching interviews and identifying the connections of the tokens in questions. Their investigation is much more detailed than anything I can put together.

If the allegations are true, Mr. Beast profited over 23M+ from insider trading and rugpulls. The blockchain is forever and it's interesting that these shady dealings are just now coming to light as all of the alleged scamming activity took place in 2021.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Survival of the Fittest in the Blockchain Ecosystem,2024-11-16 05:23:16,"I’ve been thinking about how Darwin’s theory of evolution, specifically “survival of the fittest,” might apply to cryptocurrencies. I know, analogies most of the time are stupid. Still, if we imagine cryptos as living organisms in a digital ecosystem, only the strongest and most adaptable are likely to survive in the long run.

So, how does this analogy work?

In nature, species that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Similarly, cryptocurrencies that adapt to market demands, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are more likely to thrive.

Let’s look at some examples:

Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Pioneer
- Analogy: Bitcoin is like the first species to colonize a new environment—it’s established and has a significant advantage due to being the first mover.
- Survival Traits: Widespread recognition and adoption as a store of value. Despite scalability issues, solutions like the Lightning Network are helping it adapt.

Ethereum (ETH): The Versatile Adapter
- Analogy: Ethereum is akin to organisms that evolve new functions to exploit different niches.
- Survival Traits: Introduced smart contracts, enabling a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve scalability and energy efficiency.

Tezos (XTZ): The Self-Evolver
- Analogy: Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes.
- Survival Traits: Features a self-amending blockchain that can upgrade without hard forks, allowing it to evolve smoothly. On-chain governance lets stakeholders vote on protocol changes, ensuring collective adaptation.

Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Species
- Analogy: Cardano resembles species that evolve carefully through gradual changes backed by research (think of humans developing advanced tools).
- Survival Traits: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal verification, aiming for long-term scalability and security.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Unexpected Survivor
- Analogy: Like the cockroach, which survives in various conditions despite the odds.
- Survival Traits: Started as a meme but gained a strong community and widespread popularity, showing that community support can be a key survival factor.

Just as in nature, the crypto environment is competitive, and resources (like investment and developer attention) are limited. Cryptocurrencies that can’t keep up may become obsolete, much like extinct species.

So, what do you think? Am I too off? Which cryptocurrencies do you believe are best equipped to survive?",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The media were all over FTX losing $8 Billion. Not much mention of the crypto market up $2 Trillion+ since. ,2024-11-15 13:57:50,"At the time of the FTX collapse reports were around $8.9b of customers funds had gone missing. The demise of FTX was covered literally everywhere, making headlines around the world. All the outlets that you never see any coverage on crypto on were out in force. 

Before long they had the world convinced that FTX was the GOAT exchanges and that SBF had become our King.. the King of Crypto. Which anyone within crypto knew... was a lot of shite. 

Like many, my phone blew up. 'Wow, just heard Bitcoin died"", ""Man, so sorry to hear about the death of Crypto"" etc etc. At the time, my reply was this is all a storm in a teacup, which will blow over with time much the same as Mt Gox, China Fud etc etc. There's actually been worst times to get on board. Like most cycles.. most didn't care. However it's still important to remember that shit will continue to happen, that these early boom/ bust adoption cycles are a feature and will continue to occur for the foreseeable. When crypto winters hit and crypto gets boring these are the greatest times to DCA. 

It will be interesting to see how many media outlets cover Bitcoin breaching $100k but at the end of the day know it won't matter a shit over the long-term.  As for exchanges, in crypto nothings over until it's over. Like Mt Gox many FTX are in line for receiving funds or at least part funds back. I appreciate there's still some argument around what should be due but the takeaway was that, things didn't pan out quite so bad as the media led you to believe.

**TL;DR**

Shit will always happen.  Booms/ Bust adoption cycles are a feature. Keep calm and carry on stacking. Harvest those crypto winters. Fuck the mainstream media. ",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin. ,2024-11-14 20:27:07,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

Keeping coins on exchanges is convenient. It's easy to trade, the UI is slick, and cold storage seems like a hassle. But remember:

* Exchanges can freeze your assets
* They can get hacked
* They can go bankrupt (thanks, FTX!)

If you're holding any significant amount of crypto, please take the time to:

1. Get a hardware wallet
2. Learn how to use it properly
3. Keep your seed phrase secure (not on your phone/computer)
4. Only keep trading amounts on exchanges

I learned this lesson the expensive way in 2022 and I'm feeling like this advice needs to be repeated now that the next bull is coming. Don't be like me – protect your coins. The small inconvenience of self-custody is nothing compared to the pit in your stomach when you realize your exchange account is frozen and your funds are gone.",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Nervos’ Bitcoin layer 2 to be released on mainnet next month,2024-11-15 08:13:30,"Having recently released the RGB++ protocol, a bridgeless isomorphic layer 2 for Bitcoin this year, which garnered significant attention and controversy from many crypto communities - Cell studios from Nervos network is set to release another additional development for the Bitcoin layer 2 narrative. The Fiber -network.

**INTRODUCTION TO FIBER NETWORK**

By building off-chain channels on Nervos CKB, Fiber network aims to combine the successful experience of the Lightning Network with CKB's technical advantages to create a fast, low-cost, and decentralized multi-asset real-time payment network. Specifically:

1. Solving scalability issues: Through off-chain payment channels and multi-hop routing, Fiber Network can achieve high-throughput transaction processing, meeting the needs of large-scale users. 
2. Reducing transaction costs: By reducing the frequency of on-chain transactions, it lowers transaction fees, making micropayments feasible and efficient. 
3. Improving transaction speed: The instant confirmation of off-chain transactions provides a split second payment confirmation experience suitable for various instant payment scenarios. 
4. Multi-asset support: Fiber Network supports payments in a variety of digital assets, offering users a broader range of payment options. 
5. Interoperability: Fiber Network supports interoperability with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, providing support for cross-chain payments and asset transfers. 

👉 Announcing at the recent CKCon held in Thailand, that the Fiber network is in its second proof of concept phase and on its way to **being released to Mainnet in the coming month**.

**INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**

RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps Bitcoin UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and Bitcoin chains to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to Bitcoin without the need for cross-chain transfers or compromising security.

Larger than a lot of companies that actually produce goods and real technologies that people use on a daily basis. I don't know anyone that actually uses Bitcoin or any other crypto on a daily basis. I understand it has some ""cool"" technology, well to be honest I probably don't understand. 
I do at this point want to understand though. Where do I start? Is there a good you tube channel to watch to really try to understand all of this? 
I would need crypto for a 5 year old approach. I'm not very tech savvy. I grew up outside. I don't really even know how to use excel. Lol. 
I do feel I need to try to understand what's going on with crypto. 
I want to start investing however, I am hesitant because at this point it does not look like steady long term investing strategy. To me, it looks like a couple of massive bull runs with absolute nothing in between... will this change at some point? 
Will people ever actually use crypto on a daily basis? 
I do see how these technologies are the way of the future but actually trying to figure out which ones are going to be the go to tech seems impossible at this point. Bitcoin has the largest market cap but it seems like there may be newer cryptos with better tech that could actually be more usable?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"If you hate crypto because of a lack of fundamentals, you should hate gold more",2024-11-16 10:14:23,"Let's just get the industry thing out of the way first - gold is used in industry, and by all estimates the usage of gold in industry is less than 10% of its price movement, in most estimates much less. Industry is not relevant to gold price action.

Why do I say gold is even worse than crypto for being disconnected to anything real then? Well, things change hugely and often in crypto - technology is constantly being developed (despite those features generally not having many real world applications yet). The regulatory framework is constantly changing. ETFs were approved. The view of crypto and its role in a portfolio by the tradfi world is constantly changing.

Contrast this to gold - technology is basically stagnant, the major exchanges look like websites from  the 90s or buying is facilitated by other platforms. Gold storage has been a solved problem for decades and fractional gold ownership is ironically being solved by crypto itaelf. Regulations on golf are pretty static, limited to trying to stop JPM from newly manipulating the price every decade or so. In the financial world gold is seen as an inflation and war hedge and that hasn't changed for decades either.

So, given all this certainty, you'd expect gold price to steadily rise in line with inflation but instead you get these huge spikes and plateaus like we've seen recently. The best answer for this is the geopolitical landscape making war more or less likely but that should affect similar assets like safe bonds in the same way, and those aren't half as volatile as the shiny metal.

So TLDR: gold price action is just as toxic as crypto and if you hate crypto for being disconnected from fundamentals, you shouldn't give gold a free pass.",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Money likes silences ,2024-11-16 08:46:23,"Why we here a lot of meme conis, xrp, Ada and other crypto but not of MINA?  Coinbase's COIN50, Layer 1 blockchain, zkowledge, 22kb size and zkapps incoming alongside defi?

Remind me in 2/3 month but I think it will outperform other assests. Some insights:


Technical Innovation

MINA stands out as the world's lightest blockchain, maintaining a constant size of just 22kb regardless of transaction volume. This revolutionary approach enables true decentralization, as anyone can run a full node even from their phone 

Zero-Knowledge Pioneer

MINA is leading the ZK revolution with its zkApps (zero-knowledge applications), offering:
- Unprecedented privacy and scalability
- Off-chain computation with on-chain verification
- Composable proofs that can be reused across applications

Superior Architecture

The protocol uses Zk-SNARKs to create ""snapshots"" of blockchain states, enabling efficient verification without storing the entire chain history. This innovative design is complemented by a modified Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism based on Ouroboros.

Real-World Applications

MINA's ecosystem is expanding rapidly across:
- DeFi applications
- Gaming platforms
- Identity solutions
- Privacy-focused services

Growth Potential

Being featured in Coinbase's COIN50 index alongside major cryptocurrencies demonstrates MINA's growing institutional recognition. The protocol's unique approach to scalability and privacy positions it perfectly for mass adoption.

Developer-Friendly

MINA offers a TypeScript-based development environment, making it accessible to mainstream developers while providing powerful zero-knowledge capabilities. This combination of accessibility and advanced features creates a perfect storm for ecosystem growth.

The future looks incredibly bright for MINA as it continues to pioneer the next generation of blockchain technology. This is not just another L1 - it's a fundamental reimagining of how blockchains can work.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Best off-ramps for the next year?,2024-11-15 20:56:52,"As this bull run excitement builds I have deeply planned my sale strategy but am just starting to think about optimizing sale fees via platforms used. Of course the differences here are tiny in % compared to the gains we are seeing so this should almost never inform timing or amount of sales but if I can save 1% that would still be great. 

I am flexible on platform as the majority of my holdings are in my own wallet currently of course. Some things I have seen:

Coinbase one removes fees for the first $10k USD each month but still takes spread. There is a free trial, $30 per month or $60 for the year. This seems great if you are hitting this cap as it seems to save ~$180 per $10k. Are there other platforms that offer something like this or better?

Another seemingly decent option is using Binance where they claim to have 0 fees (but probably still take spread) between btc and a few stablecoins. If you don't need to spend the cash and intend on buying back in then this is a good option. Unfortunately for me Binance is leaving my state (in the US) at the end of November so I can't use this. Do other exchanges do the same thing?

I suppose dex fees of around 0.3% would be a good bit lower than major exchange fees but that's only really relevant in excess of 10k per month if you use Coinbase one. 

Hopefully some of this information is helpful and please let me know where I am missing opportunities here. Thanks!",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Even coins that had 51% attacks, had scandals, were pretty much scams, still pumped.

But are there any coins that could vastly underperform for a big chunk of the bull market?

# What would it even take for a coin to perform poorly during a bullrun?

In the bullrun of 2021, we only had a few top market cap crypto that ran into problems and vastly underperformed.

ICP was one of the most notable ones.

It go listed on Coinbase, and skyrocketed to over $700 to an insane market cap in a matter of minutes. But then tanked through the entire bullrun.

This was an exceptional case of a bad introductory price point.

Bitcoin BSV had a big pump at the beginning of the bullrun, and then crashed prematurely and never recovered, in a quick pump and dump. It had a series of crises and then started to get delisted.

We saw a few premature crashes for cryptos like GRT.

It's not always for obvious reasons, and more for bad circumstances, making it a little harder to predict.

# Which crypto are more likely to underperform or have a premature crash?

Since it seems to be linked to some nasty surprises more than anything, it's very hard to predict.

If there's anything that's gonna derail, it's more likely a less solid project outside the top 100. There's plenty of crypto there already set up for their own crises.

This doesn't mean the top 100 is immune.

There's some shaky stuff in the top 100.

You already have tokens for questionable exchanges like GateIO.

You have newcomers in the meme world like cat in dog's world, Goatseus Maximus, dogwif hat, and Popcat. I think the meme coin of the SOL ecosystem is one that could really backfire. But I can also see it performing insanely well initially. And then it will end badly in what will be branded as the ""Solapocalypse"".

So, let’s imagine a purely hypothetical scenario. Say someone is new to crypto but is in a situation where they’re considering moving assets out of a country with strict regulations on cryptocurrency.

In this hypothetical case:
there are no local ATMs or peer-to-peer options like LocalBitcoins available. Declaring any purchase might mean risking asset seizure or facing heavy taxation (potentially over 50%).

What might be some theoretical methods someone could explore to acquire Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with an emphasis on privacy and anonymity?

Hypothetically speaking, if anyone has ideas or suggestions, feel free to share your thoughts or PM (hypothetically, of course) for privacy tips.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Rise of AI Agents in Crypto: Challenges and Opportunities,2024-11-14 22:55:34,"
This week, we witnessed a significant evolution in the world of AI agents, particularly in the crypto space. The post-$GOAT era is now unfolding, and with it comes the rise of projects like $ai16z and $zerebro, which showcase groundbreaking advancements in AI capabilities. These developments are reminiscent of the DeFi summer in 2020—a transformative period of rapid innovation and excitement.

In this post, I’ll explore the rise of these AI agents, the challenges they face (like model collapse), and the solutions that are shaping their future. I’ll also highlight why $FIJI, a promising player in this space, is my pick for the next big success.

The Evolution of AI Agents

The week began with the introduction of $ai16z, an AI agent powered by a language model (LM) that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This approach enhances the AI’s memory and search capabilities, allowing it to operate more effectively in dynamic environments.

Shortly after, $zerebro emerged, featuring near-sentient interactions that captivated the crypto community. Its success was reflected in its token’s meteoric rise, reaching a market cap of over $150 million.

These agents represent a new frontier in AI, where machines can not only interact intelligently but also adapt to changing conditions. Yet, while the excitement is palpable, the challenges that lie ahead are equally significant.

Understanding Model Collapse

One of the biggest risks facing AI agents is model collapse, a concept introduced by @jyu_eth in his detailed report on $zerebro. He defines it as:

	“A degenerative process affecting generative AI models, where training on recursively generated data leads to a loss of fidelity to the original data distribution. As AI-generated content becomes pervasive, subsequent generations of models trained on this data begin to lose information about the tails of the original distribution, eventually converging to a narrow approximation with reduced variance.”

In simpler terms, model collapse occurs when an AI agent becomes repetitive and forgetful. The novelty and adaptability that initially set it apart fade over time as it struggles to retain or incorporate new information.

This loss of novelty undermines the agent’s reliability for tasks like content creation, community engagement, and nuanced decision-making. Without addressing this issue, the vision of AI agents as hyper-efficient teammates falls apart.

Solving the Problem: Memory and Search

To prevent model collapse and ensure long-term utility, two critical capabilities must be prioritized:
	1.	Memory
AI agents need the ability to retain and recall relevant information over time. This memory allows them to build a knowledge base that grows richer and more nuanced with experience.
	2.	Search
The world is constantly changing, and AI agents must adapt. Effective search capabilities enable agents to retrieve and incorporate up-to-date information, ensuring their actions remain relevant and informed.

It’s important to recognize that agents aren’t perfect at launch—and they don’t need to be. Instead, success should be measured by their adaptability: how well can they learn, evolve, and make decisions based on new inputs?

Enter $FIJI: A New Hope

Among the many AI projects emerging in this space, $FIJI stands out. As the first AI agent to release a token last year, $FIJI initially struggled due to the tumultuous state of the crypto market. However, the development team has been quietly building, addressing the exact issues that plague other AI agents.

$FIJI’s proprietary model focuses on solving memory and search challenges, enabling near-sentient conversational abilities. With streaming capabilities on the horizon, $FIJI is poised to deliver an AI agent that not only captivates users but also evolves over time to meet their needs.

Given its strong foundation and innovative approach, $FIJI is my pick to follow in the footsteps of $ai16z and $zerebro, potentially surpassing them in impact and adoption.

Final Thoughts

The rise of AI agents in crypto marks an exciting new chapter in both AI and blockchain technology. These agents have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with decentralized systems, but only if we address their limitations head-on.

As we look ahead, projects like $FIJI demonstrate the importance of adaptability, memory, and search in shaping the next generation of AI agents. Whether we’re witnessing the dawn of a new era or the peak of another hype cycle, one thing is clear: the future of AI in crypto is one to watch closely.

What do you think about the rise of AI agents? Are they the next big thing, or just another passing trend? Let’s discuss!",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,crypto,Infinite inputs and Collisions with SHA256,2024-10-15 14:59:04,"Hi, 

Given SHA256 is supposed to be random and well distributed, is it true to say that essentially each output can have an infinite and relatively equal number of collisions generated by infinite inputs.

i.e. given in reality we have infinite inputs to feed the function (think arbitrary long binary numbers), can we assume that a properly functioning hash function has ""even and reachable"" collisions across it's output space?

Also, how can we gain confidence that a specific hash function is random and evenly distributed?",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

Reddit,crypto,Secure and Private Encrypted P2P Chat in Javascript,2024-09-22 09:03:15,"im working on a decentralized p2p chat app where it handles all the important cryptographic functions in browser-based javascript. 

the crypto functionality can be seen [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/.github/blob/main/cryptography/Cryptography.js) (it is used as a micro frontend and loaded into the main app at runtime). the main chat app is open source for transparency [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat).

i think the approach on security in this app is unique and i would like to know which vulnerabilities i haven't considered. i try to answer all concerns in [this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityAdvice/comments/1ev5kqn/is_this_a_secure_messaging_app/).

i think if i stick to the principle of avoiding using any kind of ""required"" service provider (myself included) and allowing the frontend and the peerjs-server to be hosted independently, im on track for creating a chat system with the ""fewest moving parts"". im hope you will agree this is true p2p and i hope i can use this as a step towards unparalleled privacy and security.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

file encryption:  
generate pbkdf2 derived password from main password + salt value (the same one in db) -> this derived key then be used for aes file encryption / decryption key

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-11-16 12:17:39.249869

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times
