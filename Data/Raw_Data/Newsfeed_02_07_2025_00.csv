At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance over the entire market is at 60.3% after a 4% increase in the past 24 hours. Notably, crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed to the 71% dominance level as an important threshold for crypto investors still awaiting an altcoin season. Reaching 71% Is Critical For An Altcoin Season The Bitcoin dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s market capitalization in relation to the entire crypto market, has consistently risen throughout this cycle, even during periods of price corrections. Bitcoin’s dominance has been fueled by institutional demand after the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and market dynamics favoring BTC as a potential reserve for countries.  Related Reading: Altcoin Season Paused Forever? What The Rising Bitcoin Dominance Says Will Happen A direct consequence of this prolonged Bitcoin dominance has been the sluggish performance of the altcoin market. Although some altcoins like Solana and XRP have managed to outperform Bitcoin for brief periods, the capital has consistently rotated back into Bitcoin, preventing a sustained altcoin market breakout. However, some analysts believe a significant shift could be very close, with Bitcoin dominance now sitting at a multi-year high. One such analyst is an analyst known as Rekt Capital on social media platform X. His analysis reveals a historical pattern where altcoin seasons emerge whenever Bitcoin dominance reaches a key threshold and subsequently faces rejection. According to a Bitcoin dominance chart that accompanied his analysis, Bitcoin’s dominance has been rejected around the 71% level three successive times in the past. Interestingly, each rejection has been marked by Bitcoin’s dominance falling over multiple monthly candles, as altcoins outperformed Bitcoin throughout those months.  The most recent occurrence of this pattern was during the 2021 bull market. At the time, Bitcoin dominance briefly spiked above 72% before reversing course. Once rejected, it entered a five-month downtrend, ultimately stabilizing around the 40% level as altcoins took control of the market. Will 71% Trigger A New Altcoin Season? Although Bitcoin’s dominance is not at 71% yet, it is still steadily inching upward towards this level. Particularly, Bitcoin’s dominance is at 60.3%, and there are no signs of slowing down. This means that investors banking on a repeat of rejection around 71% might have to wait longer for the dominance to even reach this level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms First Daily Death Cross On Dominance Chart In 4 Years, What To Expect Next If the 71% dominance level eventually becomes a local top again, historical patterns suggest altcoins could experience rapid gains. However, unlike in previous cycles, Ethereum may not take the lead in an altcoin season this time around. The leading altcoin has struggled to gain momentum this cycle as recent market dynamics have diminished its dominance in relation to other altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, which are witnessing more interest among crypto traders.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum Could Crash To $1,700 If This Support Fails, Analyst Says",2025-02-06 23:00:58+00:00,"An analyst has explained how Ethereum (ETH) could see its price crash to $1,700 if the support level of this technical analysis (TA) pattern fails. Ethereum Could Be In Danger Of Falling Under Ascending Channel Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about where Ethereum could head next based on a pattern forming in its 12-hour price chart. The pattern in question is an Ascending Parallel Channel from TA, which, as its name implies, involves two parallel trendlines that are sloped upwards. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovers To $2,800 As Exchange Outflows Near $1 Billion When the asset is inside this channel, it goes through consolidation towards a net upside. The higher tops in its price trace the upper line of the pattern, while the higher lows draw the lower level. Like other TA patterns, the former line is assumed to act as a source of resistance in the near future and the latter as a point of support. Breaks out of either of these boundaries can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. The Ascending Parallel Channel isn’t the only parallel channel in TA. When parallel consolidation happens towards the downside instead, the formation is known as a Descending Parallel Channel. Neither of these are the most commonly observed type, though, as that title is held by the basic Parallel Channel, which has its trendlines parallel to the time-axis (that is, they have zero slope). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Channel that the 12-hour price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: From the graph, it’s apparent that the Ethereum half-day price saw a very brief retest of the Ascending Channel’s lower level recently. The coin found support then, but its value is still floating quite close to the line, meaning that another retest could potentially happen soon. The level is currently situated at $2,500. During the last few years, this line has continuously held for the cryptocurrency, so it’s possible that it may do so again in the near future. “If Ethereum $ETH holds above $2,500, it could rebound toward $4,000 or even $6,000,” notes Martinez. The former target is around halfway through the channel from the current mark, while the latter corresponds to the upper level. The last time that ETH topped out was near the former line. Related Reading: Chainlink Witnesses Highest Whale Activity Since 2023, Price Reversal Coming? “However, if $2,500 fails as support, the next target shifts to $1,700!” warns the analyst. From the current price of the coin, a crash to this target would mean a decrease of more than 39%. It now remains to be seen whether Ethereum will retest the lower level of the Ascending Channel again in the coming days or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,800, down more than 6% over the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Trades Inside A Multi-Year Bullish Pennant – Analyst Sees A Breakout Above $4K,2025-02-06 21:30:01+00:00,"Ethereum experienced one of the craziest days in its history last Monday, plunging over 30% in less than 24 hours amid widespread market panic fueled by U.S. trade war fears. However, within hours, ETH staged an impressive recovery following President Trump’s announcement of negotiations with Canada and Mexico to ease tariff concerns. This sharp rebound has reignited optimism among investors, with many now closely watching Ethereum’s next move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Looks Stronger Compared To Altcoins – Demand Remains Strong As Price Consolidates In A Range Despite the recent volatility, top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis revealing that Ethereum is still trading within a massive bullish pennant that has been forming since 2021. This long-term structure suggests that ETH remains in a consolidation phase, building momentum for a breakout. According to Jelle, once Ethereum decisively breaks out of this pattern, a massive rally into price discovery is expected. As the market stabilizes and investors reassess their positions, ETH remains one of the most closely watched assets. While short-term price action is unpredictable, the long-term bullish structure provides strong support for Ethereum’s growth potential. Traders and analysts alike are now looking for key technical signals that could confirm a breakout and propel ETH into new all-time highs. Ethereum Struggles Below Key Supply Levels Ethereum is currently facing serious selling pressure, struggling to reclaim the crucial $3,000 mark. Bulls are in trouble as ETH remains trapped below this level, leading to heightened uncertainty and volatility in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Testing Key Support on the ETH/BTC Chart – A Parabolic Move Could Be Next  Every day that Ethereum trades below $3,000 increases the likelihood of a deeper correction, as traders remain cautious and sentiment weakens. The inability to gain momentum above this psychological level has left investors concerned about ETH’s short-term direction. However, despite the ongoing struggles, top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Ethereum is still trading inside a massive bullish pennant. According to Jelle, ETH has deviated from both the highs and the lows of the pattern, and now the market is setting its direction to tag key supply levels. This means that while short-term price action remains uncertain, Ethereum’s long-term structure suggests that a breakout could be on the horizon. Jelle believes that once Ethereum manages to push above the bullish structure, a break above the $4,000 mark will follow. This breakout would confirm a rally into price discovery, setting the stage for Ethereum to reach new all-time highs. While bears remain in control for now, the long-term bullish formation suggests that ETH could be gearing up for a major move in the coming months. Price Action Details: Technical Levels  Ethereum is currently trading at $2,820, still unable to test the critical $3,000 level. Price action remains weak, as ETH struggles to break above the $2,900 mark, which has now turned into a short-term supply zone. The failure to push higher signals that bulls are losing momentum, and the market remains in a state of uncertainty. If Ethereum loses the $2,800 support level, a deeper correction could unfold, potentially dragging the price down to the $2,500 region. This would be a significant setback for bulls, as it would confirm further downside pressure and could extend the current consolidation phase. On the other hand, if ETH manages to reclaim the $3,000-$3,100 level in the coming days, it would signal renewed bullish momentum. A successful breakout above this range could ignite a massive surge, pushing Ethereum toward higher supply levels and setting the stage for a potential run toward $3,500 and beyond.

Despite this dramatic decline, a crypto analyst has suggested that this dip could be a strategic buying opportunity for investors rather than a cause for concern.  Solana‘s BONK Retraces 2024 Gains The broader meme coin market has been experiencing a severe downturn, driven by the volatility and market changes caused by the recent Bitcoin price decline. Following United States (US) President Donald Trump’s trade war, meme coins like BONK, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others crashed severely.  Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Massive Breakout For BONK Price, Here’s The Target A recent chart analysis by a TradingView expert identified as ‘Cusdridge19523’ sheds light on the extent of Bonk’s severe decline. According to the analyst, Bonk has round-tripped virtually all of its gains from 2024, dropping over 76% from its most recent market peak.  This massive price crash marks the fourth major correction in the meme coin’s history. In 2024, Bonk experienced three significant price pullbacks that saw its price drop by more than 60%. At the beginning of the previous year, the meme coin fell 72.77% after reaching a local peak. Similarly, during the second quarter of 2024, BONK experienced a 74.2% price drop and declined again by 65.05% around the third quarter.  Its recent 76.08% in 2025 marks its highest crash compared to previous corrections in 2024. CoinMarketCap also reports that Bonks’ total gains for 2025 are about 78.82%. The meme coin experienced a gradual price drop to its current low, plummeting by 48.02% in one month and another 28.46% in the past week.  Currently, the BONK price is still in the red zone, having fallen by 1.28% in the last 24 hours. Its current price is $0.000018, aligning with past support levels and consolidation areas that triggered strong rebounds. The TradingView analyst has also revealed that the market may have to wait between 7 and 90 days for BONK to make a round trip and experience a potential price rebound. Why Now Might Be A Good Time To Buy As BONK reaches consolidation lows similar to past trends, the TradingView analyst believes its current price level presents an attractive buying opportunity for investors looking to take advantage of market dips. Historically, Bonk has shown a clear pattern of strong price reversals after sharp market corrections, giving investors more reason to believe that the token could once again deliver strong returns from market lows.  Related Reading: Meme Coin Trader Says BONK Is Headed For New ATH, Here’s Why Additionally, the TradingView expert revealed that the broader crypto market outlook for 2025 is bullish, with speculation growing around Solana-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The introduction of a Solana ETF could also drive institutional interest, indirectly benefiting meme coins like BONK. The analyst has also highlighted the possibility of a BONK ETF, adding to the bullish fire and potentially driving demand.

Cardano Fractal Analysis Points To Major Upside Martinez’s chart (published on the 3-day timeframe) draws a parallel between Cardano’s price action in the 2018–2021 cycle and its present structure, highlighting a near-identical fractal pattern. In the previous cycle, ADA consolidated for several months within a defined horizontal range before staging a decisive breakout and retest of the upper boundary. That retest then led to a parabolic ascent spanning late 2020 into 2021. In the current cycle, Cardano appears to be retesting a similar support line, shown on Martinez’s chart as a horizontal band around $0.76–$0.80. If ADA were to follow the same trajectory that transpired in its last major rally, Martinez’s “monster parabolic rally” fractal implies a surge toward $15. Related Reading: Cardano Price Breaks Down From Ascending Channel, Here Are Two Ways It Could Go Immediate Support is currently at $0.76–$0.80. According to the chart, ADA is hovering just above a critical support zone—its role in the previous cycle was to provide a springboard for the bull run that followed. The next significant resistance level is around $1.60, aligning with the upper boundary of the grey-highlighted zone on the chart. Notably this price level also aligns with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the last bull market peak to the bear market bottom. In the long term, the grey extended price line in Martinez’s chart illustrates the fractal-based projection, indicating that ADA could ultimately surge toward the $15 region. If ADA continues to follow this trajectory, the area between the 0.618 Fibonacci level ($2.00) and the 0.786 Fibonacci level ($2.47) could act as a temporary resistance zone, potentially causing a brief consolidation before the rally resumes its upward momentum. Related Reading: Cardano Consolidates Within A Symmetrical Triangle – Expert Sees A 40% Move Once It Breaks Martinez’s view hinges on the idea that crypto markets often exhibit cyclical behaviors. In Cardano’s last major cycle, once a key horizontal level was reclaimed and successfully retested, momentum accelerated sharply, culminating in an explosive move. With the current market once again retesting a crucial support zone, Martinez posits that the table is set for another extended bull phase. Of course, fractals are not guarantees of future performance; rather, they are visual aids that highlight how price structures can echo past market behavior. Whether Cardano follows this script depends on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Still, the analyst’s forecast underscores why $0.76 is a level to watch. At press time, ADA traded at $0.74. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

The market remains uncertain as bulls attempt to defend key support levels while bears push for a deeper correction. Despite this, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, holding above crucial price zones that could determine the next big move. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Testing Key Support on the ETH/BTC Chart – A Parabolic Move Could Be Next Top analyst Axel Adler shared key insights on X, revealing that as of February 6, 2025, the most critical support level for BTC is at $90.6K, based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price metric. Additionally, another major support level is found at $97.2K, calculated from the Short-Term Holder one-month to three-month Realized Price. These levels indicate where recent buyers are positioned, making them crucial for Bitcoin’s stability in the current consolidation phase. As the market digests recent volatility, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above these support levels could set the stage for a renewed rally. If BTC remains strong and demand picks up, breaking above $100K could trigger a push toward all-time highs. However, losing these levels could invite further downside pressure. Investors and analysts are watching closely to see if Bitcoin can regain bullish momentum in the coming days. Bitcoin Metrics Highlight Liquidity Levels  Bitcoin has experienced intense volatility since the weekend, with price action swinging between key levels. After a sharp drop to $91K, BTC quickly rebounded above $100K before settling around $98K. Market sentiment remains fragile as trade war fears continue to shape price movements. The uncertainty surrounding global markets and economic policies has led to increased speculation, with investors closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to hold above crucial support zones. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights on X, highlighting key technical levels that could define Bitcoin’s short-term trend. As of February 6, 2025, the primary support level is at $90.6K, based on the Short-Term Holder Realized Price metric. This level is a critical price point where short-term holders have acquired BTC, making it a strong area of demand. Additionally, another key support zone is at $97.2K, which represents the one-month to three-month Short-Term Holder Realized Price. On the resistance side, Bitcoin faces significant supply pressure at $100.6K, a level where recent buyers have concentrated their entries. This range, identified through the Short-Term Holder one-day to one-week and one-week to one-month Realized Price metrics, acts as a key barrier preventing BTC from breaking higher. If Bitcoin manages to reclaim and hold above this level, the next target would be $105K or higher, opening the door for another attempt at price discovery. Related Reading: Solana Could Target $220 If It Holds Current Levels – Analyst Expects Short-Term Bullish Momentum For now, BTC remains in a consolidation phase, with both bulls and bears fighting for control. If Bitcoin holds above its key support levels, a renewed bullish phase could emerge, pushing the price toward new highs. However, losing these zones could trigger another round of selling pressure, potentially sending BTC into lower demand levels. The next few days will be crucial in determining the market’s direction. Price Consolidates At Demand Levels: Can BTC Hold? Bitcoin is trading at $99,000 after days of choppy price action, struggling to reclaim the $100K mark. The market remains in a consolidation phase, with bulls attempting to regain control while bears push for further downside. Despite strong demand at lower levels, BTC has yet to establish a firm breakout above key resistance zones. The most crucial support level for bulls to hold is $98K. Maintaining this level could set the stage for a rally, as it has proven to be a strong demand zone in recent sessions. A successful defense of $98K would give buyers the confidence needed to push the price above $100K, a psychological and technical level that must be reclaimed to shift momentum in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: ‘Solana Breakdown Fails’ – Holding $205 Is Crucial To Trigger a Push Higher However, failure to hold above $98K would expose BTC to increased selling pressure. If the price loses the $96K mark, a deeper correction into lower demand zones becomes likely, potentially bringing BTC down to the $92K–$94K range. For now, traders are watching these levels closely, as Bitcoin remains at a crucial point in determining whether the next move will be a surge above all-time highs or a continued pullback into lower support zones.

Related Reading: XRP Price Struggles to Keep Pace: What’s Holding It Back? Based on a historical study of XRP’s price movement in 2017, this assertion makes the implication that the altcoin is set for a similar bull run. For many XRP community members, crypto analyst Steph’s viewpoint offers a ray of hope despite current turbulence. This positive view is challenged, though, by current market dynamics—including the asset’s recent 22% weekly decline. XRP: Historical Parallels With 2017 Surge Steph’s optimistic predictions are largely based on the performance of XRP during the 2017-2018 bull run. In that period, the altcoin saw a meteoric rise, increasing by 802% from March to May 2017. This surge followed a relatively quiet period, with the coin initially lagging behind other cryptocurrencies. XRP has once more exhibited remarkable increase fast forward to 2024, rising by nearly 570% from November 2024 to a top of $3.4 in January 2025. All #XRP holders will become millionaires. No exceptions. pic.twitter.com/zoLebdj8um — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) February 5, 2025 If history is any indication, Steph thinks the altcoin is only halfway toward its expected ascent. According to the analyst’s examination, a second ascent might drive the asset considerably higher, maybe reflecting the price movement registered in 2017. The Road To $50,000 Per Token Many XRP holders wonder if such a rally will turn them into millionaires. The study indicates that, although still rather hypothetical, there is a big possibility. For instance, the price per token would have to be $50,000 if one wanted a 20 XRP ownership to be worth $1 million. In the same vein, a 500 XRP-holder would need the price to reach $2,000 to make their holdings worth $1 million. Although these figures are staggering, they show the significant influence a large surge could have on portfolios of holders. However, whether such price levels are realistic is still uncertain. Deviation From 2017 Path: A New Fractal? Not every researcher shares Steph’s hope. Examining XRP’s present price movement closely reveals some variations from the 2017 trend. XRP dropped significantly from its January high of $3.4, lately falling below $3. $XRP In my opinion, 2017 is now irrelevant I see many trying to pinpoint comparison to 2017 still, I think it’s a waste of time The fractal has broken. We are in a new era and game now… Sometime the rear view helps, but not anymore IMO pic.twitter.com/03ePoONaNV — Dom (@traderview2) February 4, 2025 Analyst Dom has claimed that XRP might not go the same route as it did in 2017, suggesting a fractured fractal. Should this be the case, the cryptocurrency may be on a fresh path where future expansion is not correlated with historical price trends.

In spite of these anomalies, XRP has a long-term bright future. Recent price swings of the asset are considered as normal ebb and flow of the market. Correction times are expected, as with any high-growth asset. At $2.44 right now, XRP dropped almost 4% over the past 24 hours. Still, experts remain optimistic since the asset has great room for expansion. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"PEPE Struggles Against Strong Resistance, Bearish Pressure Intensify",2025-02-06 14:00:13+00:00,"PEPE price is facing renewed bearish pressure as it struggles to break above the critical $0.00001152 resistance level. The recent failure to push higher has left the token consolidating, hinting at a possible downward move if buyers fail to regain control. With market sentiment tilting in favor of the bears, traders are bracing for what could be another wave of selling. If bulls cannot generate enough momentum, PEPE may slip further, testing lower support zones in the coming sessions. The battle between buyers and sellers at this level will be crucial in determining the token’s next major move. PEPE Consolidation Near Resistance: A Breakdown Or Rebound? Pepe’s price action remains trapped in a consolidation phase just below a crucial resistance level, indicating market indecision. Its recent failed breakout attempt highlights the strength of sellers in this zone, preventing bullish momentum from taking over. As the price struggles to push higher, the risk of a potential breakdown increases, especially if bearish pressure intensifies.  Related Reading: PEPE Recovery Hits A Wall: Can Bulls Smash Through $0.00001313? The price continues to trade below the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), reflecting that the meme coin is still under negative pressure. This price action suggests that the market sentiment remains tilted toward the downside, as the failure to break above the SMA highlights a lack of buying strength. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending below the 50% threshold, further supporting the bearish outlook. Usually, the RSI’s position below this key level indicates that the selling pressure is currently stronger than the buying, with the market leaning more toward the downside. Further downward movement remains high until the price can break through the 4-hour SMA and the RSI sustains a move below the 50% key level. Crucial Support Zones In Focus As Selling Pressure Rises With selling pressure mounting in the market, $0.00000766 is the initial support level to watch. Historically, this level has proven to be a critical price point, acting as a psychological and technical barrier. If the price can maintain above this level, it could signal that buyers are still holding the line, offering a potential for stabilization or even a rebound. Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise Should selling pressure persist, the $0.00000589 mark will be the next key area to watch. This support level represents a deeper point of defense for PEPE, and its ability to hold might be crucial for preventing a more significant downturn. A drop below $0.00000589 would be concerning, as it can expose the price to a possible extension of the bearish trend, causing traders to reevaluate their positions. However, if the price remains above the $0.00000766 level, it may pave the way for a surge toward the $0.00001152 resistance level as buyers remain in control. A break above this level points to further gains, with the price targeting $0.00001313 and moving above the 100-day SMA.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,The Rich Bet Big on Bitcoin – Will the Market Manifest a Bull Run for Top Meme Coins?,2025-02-06 12:54:35+00:00,"Michael Sonnenfeldt recently announced that his private group Tiger21, which is composed of some of the wealthiest investors, collectively has a $200B net worth – $6B of which is strategically held in crypto, shining a light on top meme coins.  Considering some of the richest allocate 1-3% of their capital to $BTC, why should anyone doubt cryptos’ potential? Well, to put it bluntly, the sector’s rife with scams. Look at the Jupiter DEX and the former Malaysian prime minister, for instance. Their X accounts were recently compromised to promote scam coins that have rapidly caused financial losses.  Such news highlights why it’s increasingly essential to vet crypto projects before injecting capital into them. $SOLX and $WEPE are among the top meme coins anticipated to jump 100x. Plus, they’ve got some intriguing use cases worth eyeing.  1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Faster & More Scalable Solana Transactions Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first ever Solana Layer-2 network designed to address Solana’s setbacks.  Although Solana is a go-to network for dApps, DeFi, and NFTs because of its ability to roll out 65K transactions per second – contributing to its $9.383B TVL – the blockchain is no stranger to scalability limitations, network outages, and failed transactions. For example, Solana failed 40% of transactions following the high demand to buy Solana coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA, which were methodically released just days before Trump resumed presidential power in the US.  Solaxy prevents history from repeating itself by combining the benefits of Ethereum’s liquidity with Solana’s efficiency to enhance its overall capabilities.  You can leverage the L2’s benefits by snagging $SOLX on presale for just $0.001626.  Considering its already raised a hefty $18M, and $SOLX is anticipated to reach $0.025 by the end of this year, now’s a great time to participate in this thriving presale at its lowest current cost.  2. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Exclusive Trading Insights to Hinder Market Manipulation $WEPE just crossed the $70M mark on presale, mostly owing to being a low-entry point to Wall Street Pepe’s exclusive trading insights.  Wall Street Pepe shares its knowledge with $WEPE holders to give them a leg up in the trading arena and prevent crypto whales from manipulating the market.  Considering that crypto whales acquired $560M $DOGE in the span of seven days last week, its distinct utility is more important than ever. Whale purchases (large transactions) are problematic because they drastically influence a coin’s price, causing casual investors to get stuck in rapid price swings. To help make the crypto industry a friendlier place, you can buy $WEPE on presale for $0.0003665. We predict its price will reach $0.001095 before 2026 kickstarts, making now likely an opportune time to get involved. Plus, you can attain more $WEPE by staking your tokens at an 18% APY and sharing your rosy trading tactics.  3. Best Wallet ($BEST) – First Ever Crypto Wallet to Feature Presale Tokens As crypto adoption continues to rise, with 67% of American crypto owners intending to expand their portfolios, there’s no better time to find a reliable and convenient crypto wallet to store your digital assets.  But finding one that’s suitable can be a challenge. This is especially true for crypto investors who are interested in buying presale tokens while their price tags remain low-cap.  Interestingly, this is where Best Wallet ($BEST) comes out on top. It’s the first crypto wallet to feature presale tokens (including $SOLX and $WEPE), which gives it a competitive edge over leaders – even MetaMask, which has 100M+ international users.  Buying $BEST on presale (currently for just $0.023875) is a fantastic entry point into Best Wallet. Token buyers are granted a plethora of benefits: reduced transaction fees, 186% staking rewards, and community governance.  It’s not surprising that $BEST has already raised over $9M on presale.  4. Wise Monky ($MONKY) – Governance Token That Celebrates the Three Wise Monkeys Another one of the top meme coins is Wise Monky ($MONKY), having jumped by over 24% since yesterday, bringing its market cap to $46.92M. Built on the BNB Chain, the celebrated Three Wise Monkeys proverb inspires this meme coin: ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.’ Though, it changes the phrase to ‘See no fud, hear no rumors, speak no hype,’ making it more crypto-centric.  Like $BEST, it’s another meme coin governance token, giving token holders the chance to vote on the project’s future trajectory. Its support of Floki and ApeCoin (other meme coin leaders with market caps of $896.46M and $519.53M, respectively) further boosts its credibility and reach.  You can head to popular exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC to buy $MONKY for roughly $0.69.  5. Flork cto ($FLORK) – AI Agent to Give Crypto Traders a Competitive Edge Also rising high in the meme coin arena is Flork cto ($FLORK), whose $21.79M market cap is up 14.85% compared to yesterday.  Ultimately, $FLORK is a go-to coin for fans of the Flork of Cows webcomic series, which features quirky MS-Paint-drawn sock puppet characters.  On top of this, $FLORK holders are given access to an AI agent, which evaluates token sentiment and interaction and assesses industry risks like rug pulls to equip crypto traders for success.  Also bringing $FLORK into the spotlight is its very own OG NFT collection. Like trading cards, each has varying rarities, making some more desirable than others. Head to the Raydium and KCEX exchanges to buy $FLORK for approximately $0.023. Rich Investors Attract Meme Coin Hype All things considered, it’s no wonder that some of the wealthiest investors worldwide hedge big on crypto.  Although scams and whale manipulation are still significant risks, top meme coins like $SOLX and $WEPE attract attention because they have distinct utility and are low-cap investment opportunities poised for substantial returns.  However, as always, you must always do your homework before investing in crypto and never spend more than you’d be upset to wave goodbye to – the Web3 sector is a highly volatile place. ",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Analysts Predict 6,000% Surge",2025-02-06 12:30:10+00:00,"The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency’s recent predictions of huge returns have surprised the digital asset community. The meme-based coin is currently trading at $0.0000162, and analysts are forecasting returns of between 858% and over 6,000%. The accuracy of such lofty estimates has been a hot topic lately.

The token briefly recovered after plummeting to a six-month low of $0.00001160 on February 3, but then fell 6% because of concerns over US-China trade tensions. Still, Marks is among the analysts who see the token’s relatively stable price as a springboard for further growth, despite the fluctuations. Shiba Inu: Data Supporting The Hype Meanwhile, an internet celebrity known as “Investment CEO” has made the most optimistic projection, predicting that SHIB may rise to $0.001, which would be an astounding 6,072% increase from current levels. Shiba Inu’s market value would soar from its current $9.56 billion to an astounding $590 billion as a result of this action. To put it in perspective, this would make a meme-inspired token one of the most valuable digital assets in the world, outperforming some well-known cryptocurrencies with significant practical uses. $DOGE to $1.50$SHIB to $0.001$PEPE to $0.01 Interact to manifest. 🙏 — CEO (@Investments_CEO) January 12, 2025 Comparing Technical Analysis With Actual Market Conditions Technical experts highlight SHIB’s performance above specific chart patterns, especially a two-year-old descending triangle formation. One indication of underlying strength has been the token’s 13% weekly rise in January, which ended at $0.00001200. However, these technical indicators may not be enough to justify the overconfidence. There are many challenges facing the broader cryptocurrency market, including regulatory concerns and macroeconomic headwinds that might impact speculative assets like SHIB.

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Reddit,solana,"Why Liquid Staking is Better Than Staking on Centralized Exchanges (and Why You Should Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase)",2025-02-06 22:52:53,"Hey,  
I have been seeing a lot of questions about staking lately, especially around liquid staking vs. staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, or Bybit. I wanted to share my thoughts on why liquid staking is the better move and why you should avoid staking SOL on Binance (bSOL), Bybit, or even Coinbase.

**1. Liquid Staking Gives You Flexibility**  
When you stake SOL through liquid staking protocols (like Marinade, Lido, The Vault or Jito), you get a liquid staked token (e.g., mSOL, stSOL, or jitoSOL, vSOL) in return. This means you can still use your staked SOL in DeFi..lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity while earning staking rewards. It’s the best of both worlds: you’re securing the network and earning yield, but you’re not locked out of using your funds.

With centralized exchanges, your SOL is locked up. You can’t do anything with it until you unstake (which can take days). That’s a huge opportunity cost, especially in a fast-moving ecosystem like Solana where DeFi opportunities are everywhere.

**2. Decentralization Matters**  
Staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase means they control the validators. This centralizes power and goes against the whole ethos of crypto. Solana is all about decentralization, and by staking with independent validators (or through liquid staking protocols that delegate to them), you’re helping keep the network secure and decentralized.

**3. The Vault Supports Decentralization by Delegating to Community-Driven Validators**  
One thing I love about liquid staking protocols like The Vault is that they actively support decentralization. For example, The Vault delegates to validators that are actively involved in the Solana community. These validators aren’t just big players with massive stakes, they’re smaller, community-driven operators who contribute to the ecosystem. By staking through The Vault, you’re not just earning rewards; you’re helping grow a more decentralized and resilient network.

**4. Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase**  
This is where it gets sketchy. Binance’s bSOL and Bybit’s staked SOL are essentially IOU tokens. You’re not actually staking on the Solana network, you’re trusting Binance or Bybit to do it for you. This adds unnecessary counterparty risk. What happens if Binance or Bybit gets hacked, goes down, or decides to freeze withdrawals? You’re stuck.

Coinbase isn’t much better. I used to stake my SOL on Coinbase because it was “easy,” but I quickly realized I was getting a lower APY compared to liquid staking or even direct staking. Plus, Coinbase takes a (35%) cut of your rewards, so you’re leaving money on the table. And just like Binance and Bybit, you’re trusting a centralized entity with your funds. If Coinbase has issues (like they did during the SEC lawsuit), your staked SOL could be at risk.

**5. Better Yields with Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking protocols often offer competitive APYs, and you can boost your returns even further by using your liquid staked tokens in DeFi. For example, you can deposit vSOL or jitoSOL into a lending platform or LP pool and stack yields. Centralized exchanges can’t compete with that.  


I used to stake on Coinbase because it felt “safe” and familiar, but once I learned more about how staking works and the risks of centralized exchanges, I switched to liquid staking. Now I use The Vault, and it’s been a game-changer. Not only am I earning better yields, but I can also use my vSOL in DeFi to maximize my returns. Plus, knowing that my stake is supporting community-driven validators through The Vault makes me feel like I’m actually contributing to Solana’s growth. It’s a no-brainer once you understand the benefits.

What do you guys think? Anyone else make the switch from CEX staking to liquid staking? ",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

* many bots and wallet drainers
* [coinfast.fun](http://coinfast.fun) rugpulls
* $50 to $50k challenges on twitter (some could be legit) but when you comment on one immediately you will get a bunch of similar accounts writing you messages to set up a bot that will of course send the money to them
* crypto call groups - most of them are just people randomly selecting coins and promoting them, with 80% of them ending in a rugpull minutes after the call

I recently looked into the LPs on Raydium for the first time and used Metrix Finance to sim a few positions. The experience I've had before with LPs was from Pancake Swap previously.

Simming the position of SOL-RAY on Metrix shows that if you were to put down $10k based on a reasonable exposure percentage you're looking at about 100% APR give or take across 90 days. 

Is it me or do these seem to be too good to be true? You're looking at a full return within 9 months if compounding.

Reddit,solana,Trying to build my own custom RPC node,2025-02-05 20:16:14,"I’ve been digging through the official source code for the solana-validator (solana-labs/solana) for the past few weeks and I think by now I have a decent foundation. I completely reimplemented my own gossip encoder/decoder. I double checked it with the real validator output for decoding to bytes and it is exactly the same. But now I have the problem that I don‘t know to which node I should send that information (my LegacyContactInfo to be exact) to start receiving gossip. I tried a few nodes from the „getClusterNodes“ RPC method but I never received anything on my open ports on my server. Yes it has a static IP and yes all the UDP ports work, I checked by sending the info to myself.
I must add that right now my server only listens and I send my contact info from my pc. There is no ping/pong or periodic update yet, but for just receiving the first few bytes from ANYONE shouldn‘t require that or am I missing something? Any info is welcome!",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

I recently came across Berachain, and it got me thinking—could this be the next big thing that challenges Solana? From what I’ve seen, it’s gaining traction, but I don’t fully understand the technology behind it.

Solana is known for its speed and low transaction costs, making it a favorite among developers and traders. However, it has faced its fair share of network congestion and downtime issues. If Berachain offers a more efficient and scalable solution, could it take market share from Solana?

I’d love to hear from those who understand Berachain’s architecture better. How does its consensus mechanism work? What makes it different from Solana, and do you think it has the potential to outperform it in the long run?

Looking forward to some insights from the community! 🚀",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,solana,From being addicted to gambling to meme coins,2025-02-04 17:34:47,"I’m 30 years old, wife, no kid yet. My wife and I make decent salary compared to cost of living. (Midwest, not in a big city, have a home we bought June 2023 that has appreciated $45,000-50,000 since then at least). My wife and I are both government workers who will get a pension and make about $130,000 combined (my pay will max out at over 6 figs eventually) 

My wife is debt free as of a couple months ago and I have about $4,000 credit card debt. (I have a 1.3k tax refund coming so I’m still being positive) 

But I started sports gambling about 2021. It was bad, because back then cost of living was a tad lower, we had an apartment that was under $500 a month so even though I made less at that time I had a paid off 2011 car as well. I made $2600 month take home back then, so a lot of money to throw around (never was good at saving). I got into sports gambling, started with winning $20 parlays to turn into $350 etc. 

I made some decent investments in sports cards etc and made about 8-10k. We used this money to travel Europe where I proposed and I also started a side hustle (inflatable rental business company that I still run in summers, I don’t plan on growing it and only use it for side cash) 

I guess where my addiction was amplified was when i applied to get approved for an IDHA loan through my state (first time home buyer loan), they asked for bank statements. I applied in March of 2023. They denied me at that time saying “we see that up until March you’ve made $1800 sports gambling, we have to be fair with this loan and in our calculations we assume that you will be consistently winning $900 per month throughout the year which would push you over the income limit for the loan”

The lender told me I either need to wait until
June to reapply and not gamble at all till then so they won’t calculate future gambling winnings or to make a very large bet and lose on purpose.. so I made a $1,800 bet - 3 pick parlay on nba. I got lucky and that hit hit and paid me about $7,500. I took that money and used it for a down payment. We got the home inspected and will love our house. But the home inspector fucked us and on day one our ac/furnace wasn’t working which cost us $8500 total. 

I got into a tcg early and went to Gen con in Indiana and made some investments in that game early and made about 8-10k so we could pay it off. Around this time I started getting crazy with bets $300-1000 bets at a time on DraftKings. I’m still technically up, maybe 4k total. But I have recently banned myself from the sports betting apps because although I started betting smaller $25-50 bets I was going on a long losing streak and realized that I was spending more time looking at my parlays and tv to watch the game than not being present with those I love.

About 2 weeks ago I got into meme coins
My wife did warn me that it seems like what I’m doing is just something to replace my sports betting gambling. I started with $600 in SOL and built it into about 1k. My goal was to just build up to $1,200 to double my money and move stuff back into traditional crypto to help me pay off my $4,000 in credit card debt I have. 

About 2 weeks ago my brother (who invested $1,000 usd) and cousin (who invested $500 usd) got in early on a coin on Sol called $Ainti when it was announced at under 1 cent. 2 weeks ago Janice mcafee tweeted and the coin pumped up to $.42 cents - 100m market cap. My brother (who is kinda already rich) turned his $1,000 into $115,000 usd when he cashed out and my cousin (who’s broke and had debt) turned his $500 into about $75,000 usd. I guess this is what initially gravitated me toward phantom wallet. I tried telling my cousin it was luck and he would get pissed saying it was months of research (he’s only been in crypto since October 2024. 

I figured if they can’t 400x their money why can’t I 2x mine? 

The thing is, they did get lucky.. but I didn’t know it at the time.

I started with $600, turned it into $1,000 slowly. I played safe generally buying into coins wity $30-50 and getting out after making 20-30% increase or so

I also got rugged a couple times and lost money. I got rugged out of $600 yesterday and it.. hurt lol. The thing I didn’t realize is meme coins are way riskier than sports gambling even. It’s not other traders you are going up against. It’s scam artists. People constantly rug pulling 90% of projects and you don’t know when it will happen. 


I had fun with this, I’m not here trashing meme coins. Even though I lost, it was entertaining, but I’m now realizing this was just another scapegoat to replace me banning myself on sports apps. I gotta be done with both though lol. 

I guess some people get lucky and get that 1000x like my brother and cousin and maybe my luck will come later in life in some other way. lol. (I was on a 3 way phone call with them while their money was exploding up to $75,000 and $115,000 within 1.5-2 hours. I was happy for them, but also slightly jealous).

I’ve been putting paying off these credit cards for too long due to me not wanting to address them and pretend as if they’re not there.. so I will lay low and have a boring life until those are paid off now lol. ",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

I made a profit of 0.6$, and sold the token for 2.7$, I'm left with 3.3$ in my wallet?

How? I should  be left with 4.8$ + the return of the investment = 2.7

= 7.5$ at least, how am i left with 3.3$?

Reddit,solana,Are trading bots better than copy trading platforms like GMGN or Trojan?,2025-02-05 13:03:48,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been using copy trading platforms like GMGN and Trojan, but I’m wondering if using trading bots would be a more effective way to maximize profits. My main questions are:

Are custom trading bots faster and more profitable than traditional copy trading?

How do these bots work in terms of execution speed, slippage, and efficiency?

What are the risks of using trading bots, and which ones are trustworthy?

Are there any recommended platforms or open-source bots that can be used safely?

My goal is to maximize trade execution speed and get the best possible entry/exit points. I’d love to hear from anyone with experience in bot trading vs. copy trading on Solana!

Thanks in advance for any insights!",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,solana,I want to code a bot and need to know if this strategy is viable.,2025-02-05 05:13:28,"Some backstory: I got really lucky with my Solana investment. I got in ridiculously early and have DCA'd into a really good position, more money than I would ever need to spend really. But now I want my solana to work for me. So I'm coding a simple bot. Thing is, I'm not a greedy man. I don't want to hit 100x on a meme coin or screw around and risk my Solana. I really just want a small, passive income to pay my bills with. So, essentially, my plan is to ""short"" my Solana through the daily ups and downs of the price. The bot I'm coding will simply take the price at the start of the day (4am) and convert my Solana to USDC, then every hour it will check the price, if it dips around 0.5% within that hour, it will convert the whole amount back to Solana, do a little calculation and then transfer the difference into a separate wallet. Leaving my original amount of Solana untouched. It will only do this once a day and only when it has reached its daily threshold of -0.5%. I don't need a lot of money. I live a very cheap existence, so I'm calculating I'd only need about £70-£100 a day to survive comfortably and pay my taxes. But is this viable? I've backtested a few weeks of Solana prices and it's looking doable. But I thought I should run it by you lot, to make sure.

Edit: Staking is not legal in the UK, so please don't point out that I could probably make just as much if I staked the Solana.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

I joined the industry a couple of weeks ago and started learning all about crypto and the blockchain technology. Watched some bitcoin educators, Started following some guys on X, invested in some serious crypto projects and eventually got rugged by trump and melania. That’s where I found out about those meme coins and stumbled upon sites like pumpfun, photon, dexscreener. I even let a scam bot login to my telegram (thankfully I didn’t have any wallets connected yet)

Im kinda fascinated by this memecoin trading bots and stuff. Obviously I avoid using any trading sites or bots until now because I don’t want to get scammed. All these bots take fees.
All these sites take fees. And I learned trading with low amounts (like under 0.1 SOL makes you lose more money than make any profit)

So the point of this post is to ask you guys, what are your experiences with memecoin trading?

Since I’m also a coding enthusiast I thought of making my own trading bot and using rpc services like quicknode or geyser. Any tips ?

How can I trade meme coins on blockchain directly to avoid those ridiculous fees ?

Reddit,solana,To all newcomers: BE VERY CAREFUL IN WHO YOU TRUST,2025-02-04 20:20:27,"Sooo, I'll start this by saying don't be retarded like me and NEVER, NEVER FUCKING EVER do what I just did. And I'm not a beginner, I'm in crypto since 2017, and in sol I'm a pumpfun dev since july last year. And I FUCKED UP. I FUCKED UP BADLY.

So in the beginning I had no idea what I'm doing, had no budget, managed to take 3 tokens to ray by livestreaming for days in a row, but only got more or less a breakeven on them cuz I spent most of the money on bumps, useless callers, botted kols, and so on. Anyway, at least I learned. I learned how to use a bumpbot, I learned how to set up the telegram bots, like d.raidbot, majorbuybot, safeguard, rose, I learned how to use trojan for buy and sell, how to do better website designs, animated banners, and so on. But most importantly, I met people that were in this game for a way longer time than me. Some of them I became friends with, others tried to scam me, others had a weird vibe, so I stayed away from them, and with some of them I started doing token launches together... What could go wrong, right?

Well, besides 3 real life friends that helped me with the launches (mostly to make profit from them, while I did most of the work... but that's another story) I met a few ok guys and we did some good launches together, they helped me as part of the team, with marketing funds, raiding, modding on tg, and I helped them on their launches too. With them, everything went fine and we're still keeping in touch even tho some of them quit pumpfun/sol because of the toxicity and overall bad nature of the space.

But I also met another guy... He helped a lot, not gonna lie, we talked now and then, he taught me some stuff, we did two great launches, one was a cto done after Ray, the other was an organic launch started on pumpfun, no bundle, nothing but the livestream, bumps and so on. On both of them he managed the marketing and funding (spent over 20 sols on each project, the cto even had a 500x boost), he used Fatality, he spent for trendings, kols, and so on. Meanwhile, I handled the twitter raids, telegram modding, hyping up the people and I also livestreamed on thelaunches. So I started to trust him. He was always the guy willing to do marketing and make a project work, he had the marketing experience and money, while I handled the people interaction and modding aspect, and was the face of the project. There's no way he would scam me, right? Right?

Well, it all started to go downhill in late November I think... He kept talking about launches not working anymore, and using his ""custom made futures bot"" to trade on Binance (I knew the guy works in cybersec and builds his own bots, so I believed him), so I sent him 2 sol so he can trade them, and make me a bit of extra profit to use for future launches and so on. Anyway, left him that money to trade... Then before Christmas, he told me that he made 3 sols profit, so I had 5 sols, but Binance had locked his funds, and showed me screenshots from the discussions with the customer support, etc. Sent him 4 sols to buy presents for family and stuff, cuz he told me his funds are locked and he can't buy anything and he's desperate. That should have been a big red flag (that he still had my 2 sols + asked for more) but I'm retarded, emotional, I trust and try to help people I know sometimes and he seemed desperate... Then I said that maybe, after he fixes the binance stuff, he might trade the other \~10 ish sols I had, to make an x2-x3, and to use the money for some bigger launches... I was greedy, I was retarded, I didn't think straight... He told me he can't use binance, but he can trade with another bot made by him that makes less profit... 

Sent him the money, and kept 0.6 sol for myself, to have for the new years eve and so on. He told me to tell him the exact dates when I need the money+profit back, so he knows when to send them... Told him to send me 3 sols on 3-4 Jan, cuz I had to go to the dentist the week after that, and to send me another 4 or 5 sols on 12 jan, so I can pay my rent and bills on 15... And that's when he started with the bullshit.

  
He kept delaying and delaying, saying that he can't send the money because they're stuck with some other guy, and that guy is busy and will come back in a few days (he sent me screenshots, probably fake ones where he talked to himself on another account...). And he kept delaying... I canceled my dentist appointment. I got left with \~7$, and I had to ask some friends for money to buy food. I had to ask the landlord to postpone my rent for the next week. I had 3 major mental breakdowns, on one of them I went nuts and sent 1370 messages to the guy, while I was crying and swinging between wanting to punch walls or jump off the window and kms :/ He kept saying that he's gonna send the money, soon, it's gonna be fixed, while I was slowly losing my fucking mind.

Eventually I paid the rent using the security deposit from the landlord, but I had to move out cuz I couldn't pay the rent anymore... Some friends helped me with food, a bit of money, and now I moved into a friends place, I'm staying in their living room for a while, until I figure out what to do next. Most likely I'll try to launch a token and try to recover some of the lost money, and then try to slowly climb up the ladder and try to get out of the trenches once again.

Soo yeah, be super careful in who you trust...

Anyway, TL;DR: lost everything cuz I got scammed by a guy that I trusted, I did launches together with him, he always had money, so I didn't think he would go that low and scam me... It's a reason they're called the trenches, everyone is out to get you unfortunately :/

Also, I'll attach some screenshots with the conversations if I can, maybe it will help other people not to fall for scams like these:

Hey all, have a solana Technical question and seeking some help, as I’m not really aware of how it all works. Will try to keep vague just in case it’s a big issue and rather inform the people privately.

There’s a token that’s not yet available for purchase through exchanges, allegedly. I found the address _somehow_ (it’s easy to be found).

So I basically took the address and searched for the token on Phantom app. It is there. When I first tried to buy, it didn’t allow me. I placed a random $SOL value to exchange and the offer was 0.

I decided to check it out every now and then, and then on one attempt, it allowed me to buy 0.99 tokens. The cost was something like 0.0005 sol for it. Any value above that, provided the same amount of tokens: 0.99, so I tried a bit to see what was the minimum I could afford.

Then when I tried to swap for sol again, it offered back something similar of what I paid. Interestingly, I decided to keep trying that every now and then. 

Eventually, it offered more:

• 0.00001 $token for 0.02SOL
• 0.00001 $token for 0.04SOL
• 0.00001 $token for 0.45SOL 👀

Feels like there’s something wrong in the whole thing and I have no idea if it’s Solana, Phantom, Raydium, Jupiter or the token itself.

I’ve sent an email to Phantom and Raydium to let them know but not sure who’s the right people that need this information.

Any ideas of what should I do next?

TLDR; swapped less than 0.001 $SOL for 0.99 of a token that shouldn’t be available and then I managed to convert a fraction of that into 0.5 Sol. Help on how to move next",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Reddit,ethereum,🚀 Major Update: Wanchain’s ETH XFlows Now Integrated with Polygon zkEVM! 🚀,2025-02-03 14:56:23,"https://preview.redd.it/mnxzuga2uxge1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=930d2fb712a78a211091fca9262c13d3acd8fdb9

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

Reddit,ethereum,How to Encrypt a Message for an Ethereum Address Without Knowing the Public Key?,2025-01-30 17:13:32,"I'm working on a project where I need to **encrypt a message and send it over the blockchain** so that **only the intended recipient can decrypt it**. The challenge is that I only have the recipient's **Ethereum address**, but encryption typically requires their **public key**.

Since Ethereum addresses are derived from the public key but don’t expose it directly, I’m looking for the best approach to encrypt data for a recipient without having their full public key beforehand.

How to tackel this any idea??

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

Reddit,ethereum,I cant understand all this.,2025-01-26 15:40:20,"I'm currently preparing for in campus placements, and working on data structure and algorithms for hiring rounds. Meanwhile two people of my class magically somehow appear announce events about web3 blockchain etc etc and I'm not sure how they started getting funding for it. They went to Bangalore for some meetup, conducted some meetups in my city and now they arr going to eth denver, one of them posted about the visa approval and tickets to the event. I was stunned. I talked to them and they have become literally so arrogant about giving information, and said they don't give a fuck to studies of college. I'm not sure what they are doing to achieve so but for student like me willing to study hard, and earn success gets insecure about not knowing everything hi fi going [around.Read](http://around.Read) more

Here's the x profile of one of them [https://x.com/Aniketsahu\_115?t=Eg3DDS1brESKGXjQbLs2jQ&s=09](https://x.com/Aniketsahu_115?t=Eg3DDS1brESKGXjQbLs2jQ&s=09)

The things they are doing, if done by me (leadership, event, club bla bla) will serve as a good repose for my statement of purpose for higher studies.

Reddit,ethereum,I've created a Game and hidden seed words throughout it.,2025-01-25 10:07:53,"Hi reddit, I challenge you all.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

We hope you love it and have a nice day. **�**�",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO. FYI CEO of this company is doing a fireside chat on Tuesday in case you wanna shill an $ETH MicroStrategy approach for him lol.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

 * Beyond Transactions: Ethereum goes beyond simple currency transfers. It enables the creation of smart contracts – self-executing agreements with built-in rules – unlocking a world of possibilities.    
 * Decentralized Applications (dApps): From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming and beyond, Ethereum empowers developers to build innovative dApps that are secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship.  
 * A Thriving Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts a vibrant and active community of developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.  
I believe Ethereum has the potential to shape the future of the world. So forget about price talk, that isn't the reason why any of us go into Ethereum after all.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,I am terrified to move my BTC,2025-02-06 14:53:23,"Hello fellow BTC pro’s

I want to start out by saying I am sorry for this post. I have somewhere between .5-1 BTC sitting on an exchange. I’ve been DCA’ing for several years now. And I am absolutely *terrified* to move it off the exchange. 

I know I need to do it. I see the constant comments about supply shock and the rapid removal from BTC from exchanges. I know mine isn’t safe where it is. 

The problem is, I’m so scared to move it. I work in tech, and I’m still not comfortable moving it. Then to top it all off, I have the memory of a fish. I’m scared I’ll lose my keys.. even though I do have several backup plans for those. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this initial fear? I just can’t be the only one who feels this way… 

Anyone who also faced this same issue want to share what worked to make you comfortable doing this? 

Anyone who DM’s me is going to get blocked. I read this sub like the morning paper and I’m overly cautious of being scammed (outside of my BTC staying on the exchange)🤡",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,bitcoin,Why HODL of Bitcoin is still the move 🚀💰,2025-02-07 00:25:43,"Yes, it's volatile. Yes, there are ups and downs. But every time the price dips, it’s just a chance to **buy more** and hold for the future. **Bitcoin has consistently proven to rise over time**, despite all the noise around it.

Here’s the simple truth: **Bitcoin is scarce**, and as more people adopt it and demand increases, its price will continue to appreciate. We’ve seen this pattern before and it’s only going to continue as the world shifts towards digital assets.

So, if you’re holding Bitcoin, don’t worry about the short-term fluctuations. **Patience is key**. The people who held through the bear markets of 2017-2018, or the crash in 2020, were rewarded handsomely. The future looks even brighter with more institutional adoption, global economic uncertainty, and growing demand for decentralized finance.

Long-term holding isn't just a strategy – it’s a **commitment to the future of money**. And in the end, Bitcoin will likely be worth far more than we can imagine today. Remember the post in 2035.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,bitcoin,Concerns about BTC systemic adoption,2025-02-06 21:19:32,"Hi everyone! Just bought my first fractions of BTC about one month ago. I have some concerns regarding the possible wide adoption of BTC and wanted to talk about them here. People here are as biased as you can be, but I hope I will be able to discuss about this in depth. Disclaimer: I am new to this, and might say wrong stuff. If so, please correct me kindly.

Here are my points:

1• **Since the beginning of society people always had their assets managed by others.** Having our assets in physical form (gold, jewelry, now wallet) is unreliable and dangerous as we can easily loose them. The average guy does not want to have the mental charge of risking to loose the entirety of his assets for a single bad move. I agree that the central institutions are bad etc, but they offer a certain protection against attacks (you’re not going to loose money if the bank gets robbed for example). You can loose everything only in very extreme cases, which for me happens way less than forgetting a seed phrase. So, the average Joe is not putting everything on BTC because of how scared he is, except if there is a « bitcoin bank » of some sort. Which repeats the cycle of centralized institutions for me, since the bank controls the money.

2• **Everything relies on the BTC protocol.** If this protocol gets broken, EVERYONE LOOSES EVERYTHING. This would not be like a single bank going bankrupt, this would be THE ENTIRE SYSTEM COLLAPSING over a single broken protocol. Which is very scary to think about.

**TLDR:** Managing your own assets is dangerous, and centralizing the worlds’s assets on one single protocol is even more.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

The original goal was to make money so I didn't have to work anymore and retire early.

Well exceeded that goal, the funny thing is I can't bring myself to sell any of it because the more I've learned about Bitcoin and the traditional fiat debt slave inflationary system, the more I've realised that selling out of Bitcoin for fiat currencies or any other traditional asset is a losing game against inflation..

But when does it end? You can't earn a yield or an income from Bitcoin. You are sitting there with amazing numbers on the screen and still live like a peasant. I've considered selling up to 50% of my stack but obviously timing would be hard in this bull run. Ladder selling would be the best way.

I've run the numbers on selling Bitcoin and diversifying into other assets vs 100% holding Bitcoin and honestly nothing beats BTC.

If you earn even a 5% yield on another asset it still loses out to true inflation which is minimum 7% a year.

I am by no means asking for financial advice and will do plenty of my own research, but I am considering selling off some of my assets in order to reach 0.1 BTC (21 million club is out of reach, but this is the next best for me)

To finance this , I would sell off;

* \~0.03btc of Pokemon cards I bought as investments over the last years
* \~0.04btc worth of S&P 500 

And acquire the remaining \~0.015 with cash I have spare, and this would result in me having approx 50% of my net worth in Bitcoin.  I would continue to retain just under half of my S&P and just under half of my Pokemon investments and enough cash for emergencies.

I’m sure I will be disagreed with, but I think you would have to stretch the meaning of the word early to still consider this early.
Where I think we’re at, in an analogy:

If we compare bitcoin to LeBron James, first adopters would be like his friends in elementary-middle school. 
The next adopters would be like his friends and opponents who played against him in middle school. Early high school would be like the $1,100 peak, winning high school/being on cover crowned the next ‘one’ would be like the $20,000 peak, and we are probably at least a year or two into his nba career. 
I would guess we’re at year 2 LeBron give or take. Is that early? In some context yea it would be good to bet on this guy. But I see early as like getting your ass kicked by him in 9th grade.

Realme 8 5g with Adroid. Install Electrum and AirGap vault apps, remove wifi/bluetooth and SIM modules (hardware remove).

Generate 24 word + passphrase wallet on the now air-gapped phone, generate corresponding watch only wallet on laptop.

**Usage:** Use watch only wallet to check balance and generate transactions, pass to Realme wallet via QR code, sign, and pass back signed transaction via QR. Watch only will broadcast the transactions.

**Bonus:** with Electrum, I can set up my own multi-sig (2 over 3 sounds easy). With AirGap Vault I can have a separate wallet for smaller amounts.

Notes: Why Realme 8 5g? because I have a spare one. In any case, if the phone gets broken, I can still access the wallets on a new device with the words and passphrase.

Why going through these steps?

These are some of the alternatives I have seen:

1. Similar setup, but replace Realme setup with bootable USB, Tails OS. Props if it does not have persistence. PROBLEMS WITH THIS SETUP: I need a separate PC laptop to boot the OS, and need to import the wallet every time I want to use it (well actually this second one is not bad :D ).
2. Trezor 3 Safe and many more HW wallets. Easy to setup and use. PROBLEM WITH THIS SETUP: Most HW wallets I have seen connects via USB, or use a microSD to pass the transaction to sign.

Reddit,bitcoin,On the origins of money,2025-02-06 20:42:16,"In most Bitcoin and Austrian econ books it is assumed that money emerged as a solution to the double coincidence of wants in barter trade and the whole argument for Bitcoin as a better form of money is derived from that. The problem with this origin story is that it doesn't seem to be rooted in facts. The archeological studies to date weren't able to find any real world barter economies that worked before money supposedly emerged. The findings seem to suggest that most pre-money economies were gift economies where trades were not economically optimal.

There's a lengthy article by David Graeber on this issue to be read [here](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/david-graeber-on-the-invention-of-money-%E2%80%93-notes-on-sex-adventure-monomaniacal-sociopathy-and-the-true-function-of-economics.html).

The problem I have with his arguments is that he describes a gift economy as a small scale exchange of goods and favors where there's a degree of trust between individuals and implied reciprocation, but it's not really gifting if you expect something in return in the future. It's credit and, for any non-trivial value exchange, it only makes sense if you can reasonably expect it to be paid back. This won't work for trade between strangers or different tribes and Graeber describes a barter system with a ritual social layer on top of it, arguing that the ritual was just as important as the exchange itself. On the other hand, he concedes that there were more or less fixed exchange ratios in those trades.

>As a result, as Chris Gregory observed, what you ordinarily find in such ‘gift economies’ is a broad ranking of different types of goods—canoes are roughly the same as heirloom necklaces, both are superior to pigs and whale teeth, which are superior to chickens, etc—but no system whereby you can measure how many pigs equal one canoe.

This completely ignores the marginal theory of value, though. While a canoe might be worth roughly the same as a heirloom necklace, a second or third canoe will probably be worth less than their equivalent in heirloom necklaces if you don't need additional canoes. You could be incentivized to trade your necklaces for a good that you would be able to easily trade with someone else later, but that implies the existence of a most salable good, which would simply mean the good that is accepted by the most people and trade would probably converge around it eventually. That leads back to the Austrian origin story of money, though. If it doesn't then it leads to the double coincidence of wants problem, because the person with the canoes would have to find someone who would have something you value and trade their canoes for it before they trade with you.

Also, the existence of a ""broad ranking of goods"" in terms of their value implies that all goods should have more than one trading pair. If so, then for any two goods there probably exists a series of exchanges through other goods where a rough exchange rate between A and B could be established. The shorter the exchange path, the less lossy the exchange rate, which implies that as more goods become available it becomes increasingly more convenient to converge on a singular unit of account and that again leads us back to the Austrian origin story of money.

Graeber also points out that there is evidence that money was created through legislation as a unit of account for compensation and accounting. This also leads to convergence of exchange rates to the rates defined by law and the legislated units being broadly used for value expression eventually. On the other hand, if market exchange ratios diverge significantly from the exchange rates defined by law, the law would probably be amended to reflect the new fair compensation value.

My opinion is that what Graeber describes as gift economies can only work in relatively small trusted communities and that outside of those communities trade was done through barter (even if the barter was ritualized as described and had an additional social layer attached to it). Moreover, even if we concede that money did not emerge organically and was initially created by non-state administrations as Graeber claims, it would make sense for merchants to eventually adopt it as a universal unit of account, since the exchange would be deemed fair by law and it's much simpler to trade with fewer intermediate goods involved.

It's also my opinion that even if we concede all of Graeber's points, the scale of the current world economy needs money for trade to happen. Therefore, even if money didn't emerge from the free market, competing forms of money exist now and are subject to free market dynamics. The Austrian arguments for why markets should converge on a superior form of money when multiple exist still seem sound to me.

I ask this because I would assume one would still keep contributing to a 401k for the employer match. However, for a Roth IRA, I see two sides.

Notwithstanding it's been in place for many years, and I really don't have any actual concerns, I was curious what others thought of it,

I'm happy I asked, because many little holes got poked in my setup. Nothing that's imminently concerning, but while I'm not a big fan of ""don't fix it if it ain't broke"", I think in this case it's worth doing just to remove any doubt.

Happy to once again post my plan, and happy to hear suggestions if I missed something or didn't take something into consideration. 

I now have a brand new Trezor, on which I'm going to create a new wallet. The recovery phrase it spits out will be handwritten on a piece of paper, of which I will make a few copies. I also ordered a couple of imKey HeirBOX, both of which will get the new wallet recovery phrase. The phrase will never be typed in, anywhere. As per a recent reply to my last post, no pictures will be taken of that phrase either.

I'm pondering what to do with the pieces of papers and HeirBOXes... they will find very safe places to live the rest of their lives.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,bitcoin,Are there any proposals or research on making bitcoin's PoW useful for real-world computation?,2025-02-06 18:57:52,"Bitcoin’s **proof of work (PoW)** mechanism secures the network by requiring miners to perform massive amounts of computations to find a valid nonce. However, these computations—though essential for Bitcoin’s security—are **purely wasteful in terms of real-world utility**, as they serve no purpose beyond reaching the target hash.

**Are there any proposals, research papers, or experimental ideas** exploring ways to make PoW contribute to **useful computational tasks** while still maintaining Bitcoin’s security?

For example, could mining be designed to also perform:

* **Scientific simulations**
* **Protein folding** for medical research
* **AI model training**
* **Other forms of distributed computing**

If such ideas exist, what are the **technical and economic challenges** preventing their implementation? Would altering PoW in this way compromise Bitcoin’s decentralization or security?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Finding Out About Crypto Ruined My Life,2025-02-06 23:33:56,"Let me preface this by saying that as someone with an engineering degree I’m a complete idiot. 

I learned about crypto while I was in college in 2017. Funny enough my classmate told me about bitcoin in 2015 when it was $400 and I laughed it off as broke college kid. Anyway, 2017, I became obsessed and I had my phase of telling everyone I knew about crypto and that they should buy.

I managed to turn a few hundred bucks into 10 grand. As someone who’s been a lazy procrastinator my whole life this new thing was my golden ticket out of needing to work ever again. Of course I didn’t sell anything before it disappeared.

By 2020 I had almost forgot about my bag. By 2021 I felt like a genius again and “knew” I was right. I still never pulled out cash, if I sold, it was to buy other coins and you know how that went. It’s 2025 now and I’m tired. I’m tired of what crypto has done to my mental health. 

These crazy crypto swings have made it so I’m entirely not grounded with money. What’s $500 when we’re seeing $5k swings (and never selling, just eating poopoo). 

That’s not even the best part, because don’t forget as lazy person the idea of one day becoming a crypto millionaire (so hopeful) is a great way to kill your career ambitions. Now here we are, crypto is finally gaining some traction in the real world and I’m not a millionaire no where close, my job is shit, and I got a ton of debt. 

Don’t be like me. Don’t romanticize your gains. Work hard in your life as if crypto is going to zero. I’m sure many of you will think this nonsense doesn’t apply to you. It does. Anyway I welcome the chat to shit on my and/or make me feel better. Thanks. ",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

From 2013 to 2017 Bitcoin increased by 17,492%, from 2017 to 2021 Bitcoin increased by 252%, and so far, Bitcoin has increased by just 62% from 2021 to 2025, so this alone proves that the chances of you getting rich off of a Bitcoin investment without access to millions of dollars to invest is not happening.

With that being said, we plebes look to Bitcoin's cheaper alternatives to achieve wealth beyond our wildest dreams, but will they actually increase enough in 2025 to get us there is the ultimate question?

One of the issues we currently face nowadays that has been keeping me up at night is all the big players now taking money out of the pot. Heck, we even have the President of the United States himself throwing his coin in the ring, along with his old lady’s meme coin to boot!

The issue here is that all the dumb money is now so overly saturated, so that useless and worthless coin you and I decided to invest in months or even years ago may never suck in enough of that dumb money to pump it to the Moon and beyond.

We need these dummies. They serve as exit liquidity to inevitably enrich ourselves, because let's be real here, this is the only reason why any of us buy meme coins to begin with am I right?

Fast forward to today though, and we have players like Solana, which grants the ability for any thot and their pimp such as the Hawk Tuah Girl to create a coin, have some shady somewhat smart people market it, and then rug all the dummies who thought they would get rich off it, then rinse and repeat.

This is a problem see, because all of that dumb money is drying up, plus if you could believe it, some of these dummies actually learn their lesson and actually stop investing in dumb projects... which becomes our problem in the end.

I'll leave you all with a question: Will 2025 be another cryptocurrency super cycle year, or is the real money made these days strictly by creating, promoting, and rugging the mentally challenged?",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Since AI is supposed to be good at pattern recognition, this seems like it should be an ideal field for AI to excel at - and without the emotion of human responses. 

But I've tried a number of different AI bots available in my exchange and all of them do nothing except lose money. It strikes me as a little odd because it should be very easy to create an API to follow the ""regular"" trading rules, and AI should be better at it since it has the advantage of context as well.

Now it's 4 years later and Bitcoin is well past its 2021 ATH, but most of my alts are still 70-80% down. Now it feels like the cycles has ended before it even started. At this point, I’m wondering if I should:

A) Salvage what’s left and rotate into BTC/stocks?

B) Hold out and hope they eventually recover

What’s your strategy in this situation? Should I take the L and reallocate, or is there still hope for these coins to rebound?

Hey guys my apologies if this post sounds ignorant or uneducated  I just recently started my first major job and want to begin slowly investing in crypto. Is there a book or a YouTube channel that can provide insight in to how I can begin and then manage my portfolio? It all seems very complicated to me lol but you guys seem to have a great community  here that seems really knowledgeable so would love advice on what made you guys more knowledgeable on crypto. 

I want to spend a couple of months educating myself and then jump into it on a small scale until I feel comfortable then look to see how I can invest more and more. 

Genuinely  feel clueless  and don't know where to start.  I'm really hoping there is a book or a channel that could help me out starting as a beginner I have no idea really what the terms mean or even what methods  people commonly use to find success.  ",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Are there any proposals or research on making bitcoin's PoW useful for real-world computation?,2025-02-06 18:58:56,"Bitcoin’s **proof of work (PoW)** mechanism secures the network by requiring miners to perform massive amounts of computations to find a valid nonce. However, these computations—though essential for Bitcoin’s security—are **purely wasteful in terms of real-world utility**, as they serve no purpose beyond reaching the target hash.

**Are there any proposals, research papers, or experimental ideas** exploring ways to make PoW contribute to **useful computational tasks** while still maintaining Bitcoin’s security?

For example, could mining be designed to also perform:

* **Scientific simulations** 
* **Protein folding** for medical research 
* **AI model training** 
* **Other forms of distributed computing** 

If such ideas exist, what are the **technical and economic challenges** preventing their implementation? Would altering PoW in this way compromise Bitcoin’s decentralization or security?

Have not been active at all for quite some time. After a few weeks back of lurking I have to say that It feels like so many former eth enthusiasts chase the memecoin for the crazy gains nowadays. I am still here for the tech. 

But if you have hate for eth because of whatever and don’t feel justified in selling cause that would turn those unrealized losses into realized ones, than I might have a solution. 

I can take on the burden of holding eth like Kyle did it with credit card dept in Southpark. 

There would be no need to dm me and I have nothing of real matter to say in this space. But that one think I feel I can do for you guys so this space can start thriving again. 

No regard should hold an established coin in the industry with no gains to show for so here it is.

If we all knew how to store and use crypto overnight their business wouldn’t be necessary. However, they are much simpler than crypto, and I think they fill a niche that will always exist. I don’t often listen to their earnings calls, but someone essentially asked how they will deal with competition from things such as cryptocurrency.  

Their response was effectively that they are exploring ways to legally and effectively settle funds via crypto. This will reduce float in the system, and speed up inefficiencies of using the traditional swift based banking system to move money and settle transactions. Those are their words. The answer was very well thought out IMO and it makes me excited.  

It could very well be that this particular company doesn’t figure out how to implement this, but I see them as a dinosaur company, and the fact that they are interested in this is just nice to hear I guess.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,BTC Dominance,2025-02-05 09:38:32,"BTC & Chainlink are the only cryptos up in my portfolio. BTC average is around 63k. BTC is my second biggest holding after ETH. 

My alt bags are down heavily between 15%-60%. They were up a similar amount in November and I didn't take profits. 

Does it make sense to use extra cash to average up on BTC in 90-94k range or to cut losses on some of the alts until QT ends. Or just wait.

ETH bag is 17% down.. Literally bought some more ETH at the worst time before last weekend... I know. 

I treat BTC as an investment. The BTC I own is basically in an ETF (which I know, a lot of people on this sub will say what's the point if you don't have it on your own wallet?). I get that, I get the risks, but I came into BTC a lot later and I treat it as any other asset class. 

I'm planning to sell the BTC this bull cycle by the end of year. As well as selling all other cryptos too.

The question is: wait and hold the alt bags until QT ends. Who knows when this could happen, and alts could bleed a lot more until then. 

Or just cut some of the smaller losses alts and go all in on BTC. I haven't sold any BTC since I bought in August, so I would be averaging up.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Inverse Cramer? Last week, Cramer turned bullish on crypto and we saw the largest crypto liquidation within days",2025-02-05 01:21:08,"A week ago, Cramer was telling everyone to hold Bitcoin out of the blue: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ibw8mq/jim\_cramer\_says\_hold\_bitcoin\_not\_microstrategy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ibw8mq/jim_cramer_says_hold_bitcoin_not_microstrategy/)

Within days, BTC got to its lowest price of the year of 91.5k - which was close to a 3 month low since November of last year.

Altcoins got even more badly rekted, with many major alts losing close to 1/3 of their value on the daily chart. Shitcoins got rekted even worse.

This was the largest crypto liquidation ever (2 billion was wiped out), and this isn't the only major event Inverse Cramer has predicted. Let's look at other crazy accurate Inverse Cramer calls for each year which would have helped you to make a killing:

* Flipping totally bullish on BTC in 2021 at the 69k peak - that was also the crypto market peak for the cycle.
* After the FTX crash, screaming that Solana would go to zero when the price was at the bottom below $10 (if you bought then, 20-30x returns in less than 24 months)
* Being bearish on BTC and crypto just right before we had the run up to 100k late last year

When Cramer is bearish, we are rightfully bullish.

And when Cramer is bullish, I see comments always saying ""This time Inverse Cramer will fail"" - but heck the hopium always fails. Cramer shoots, and he will miss the target 100% of the time!

I'm convinced that the only reason that the Inverse Cramer ETF didn't take off is because he himself started buying the ETF in the first place.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,How Movement is revolutionizing DeFi's scalability and security on Ethereum with Move.,2025-02-05 15:54:08,"Movement contributes to the scalability and security of DeFi applications on Ethereum through a number of technical and architectural innovations, primarily by integrating the Move programming language and its virtual machine (MoveVM) with Ethereum's liquidity and ecosystem.

  
Here are Movement's main contributions to the scalability and security of DeFi applications on Ethereum:

**Enhanced Security with Move:**

* Resource-Oriented Programming: The Move language uses a resource-oriented programming model, where digital assets are managed as resources with strict rules about their creation and transfer. This significantly reduces common vulnerabilities in Solidity, such as re-entry, overflows, and underflows.
* Formal Verification: Move includes Move Prover, a formal verification tool that mathematically analyzes code to ensure correctness and detect vulnerabilities before execution. This process provides a higher level of security than Solidity, where vulnerabilities are common and have resulted in billions of dollars in losses.
* Common Attack Prevention: Move is designed to inherently prevent common attacks on Solidity, providing an additional layer of security for DeFi applications.

**Escalabilidad a Través de la Paralelización:**

* Block-STM Engine: The MoveVM implements Block-STM, a parallel execution engine that allows multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously. This results in higher throughput and scalability, reaching up to 180,000 TPS, compared to the limitations of the EVM. The ability to execute transactions in parallel is crucial for DeFi applications that require high throughput and low latency.
* App-Specific Rollups: Movement allows the creation of application-specific rollups, isolating the transactions of one application from others on the network. This avoids congestion and bottlenecks, allowing high-activity DeFi applications (such as gaming and trading) to operate without affecting the performance of other applications on the same network.

**Interoperability and Liquidity:**

* EVM support - Movement offers EVM support through the Fractal interpreter, allowing developers to deploy existing Solidity contracts on MoveVM. This makes it easy to migrate Ethereum DeFi applications to Movement without rewriting code, preserving the original logic and functionality and leveraging Move's security. In addition, Movement connects the MoveVM and Ethereum ecosystems, allowing applications to run on multiple blockchains.
* Liquidity Access: Movement enables DeFi applications to access liquidity in both Ethereum and the Move ecosystem. By connecting to these two worlds, DeFi apps can take advantage of existing liquidity in Ethereum, while benefiting from the security and performance of Move.
* Secure Bridges: Movement uses an Ethereum JSON RPC endpoint to process EVM requests and convert them into MoveVM-compliant calls, eliminating the need for third-party bridges and their associated vulnerabilities.

**Modular and Customizable Infrastructure:**

* Move Stack: Movement uses a modular architecture called Move Stack that allows developers to choose the most appropriate components for their applications, such as sequencers, data availability and settlement mechanisms. This modularity allows developers to optimize the performance, cost and security of their DeFi applications.
* Decentralized Shared Sequencer (DSS): Movement uses a shared decentralized sequencer that improves censorship resistance and reliability. The DSS facilitates atomic transactions between chains and shared liquidity between rollups, improving the efficiency and security of the ecosystem.

**Examples of DeFi applications in Movement:**

* VCRED: An AI-enhanced liquidity management platform, uses Movement to increase capital efficiency by up to 160x. VCRED leverages the security of Move and the scalability of Movement to optimize staking strategies and deliver better returns.
* Meridian and Echelon: Lending protocols that have raised capital and are building in the Movement ecosystem.
* Raga Finance: A platform for managing assets in a multi-chain world, offering native yields and secure transactions.

Movement not only provides a more secure environment for DeFi applications through the Move language, but also improves scalability through parallelization and modular architecture. The combination of security, performance and EVM compatibility make Movement a promising solution to drive growth and innovation in the DeFi space on Ethereum.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Do you think cryptos have become one more instrument for the rich to take our money?,2025-02-04 11:32:59,"With the recent rugs pulls, and the generally unbridled speculation surrounding cryptos in the last year or so, I started having doubts about this whole thing.

At the beginning it seemed that Cryptocurrencies could be a place where even us poors could compete with the rich and make a lot of money. Now it looks like it has become another instrument for them to transfer money from the middle class to the upper class. This recent events aren't the natural ebb and flow of the market, but a deliberate attack to bankrupt small investors and newbies.

Do you think the crypto space will be different in a few years? Will it be an upper class only space? Where do the small fish go in this pond? Are we all gonna get eaten alive by sharks?

EDIT: Thanks to everybody who is commenting their opinions and experiences! I'd like to point out that I did not make this post to ""complain"" as some are implying.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

You could prove the inputs for each iteration of the loop outputs the inputs for the next iteration of the loop. This is highly parallelisable and the polynomials involved would be tiny making inversion steps much simpler.

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

The private key is any 256-bit number in [0, N] where N is the order of the curve. So if I have a random 64-byte stream, the probability of it being a valid EC public key on the curve is `N / 2^512 = 2^256 / 2^512 = 2^{-256}`. Does this sound right?

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Then the patient uses his/her private key to sign the data, and then the hospital encrypts it (page 5):

So I'm guessing (pk0, pk1) is probably from Ed25519 but (ak0, ak1) may be from X25519. The patient data is then encrypted using ak0, but isn't that something you aren't supposed to do? The paper doesn't mention the size constraints on patient data either.

It then says that:

>The newly generated data has to be validated before they can be added to the blockchain. These data are validated by the admin (doctor, pathologists, radiologists) following the process depicted in figure 5 using the admin private key ak1.

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670

Reddit,crypto,A mnemonic system to (almost) effortlessly memorize 128-bit of entropy,2024-12-28 12:47:51,"Hi,

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

    # NOTE: No concerns are made for timing safety
    # These two functions are just plain CTR mode with key commitment enhancement
    def encrypt(nonce, key, plaintext_blocks):
        sequence_iterator = counter.start(nonce)

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-02-07 00:52:32.198670
