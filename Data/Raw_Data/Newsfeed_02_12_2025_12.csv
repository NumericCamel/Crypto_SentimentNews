These include a former hotel developer, a software development company, and a mobile game studio. But what’s driving them to spend billions of yen on $BTC? We’ll discuss these and more in today’s article. Plus, we’ll find out why meme coins are also following suit in their optimism for $BTC’s future. If you’re an investor betting on the cryptocurrency’s growth, you can check out BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). It’s currently one of the best presales in the market, which brings together $BTC believers to leverage its rise beyond $100K. Why Is Japan Riding the $BTC Wave? Japanese firm Metaplanet Inc. saw its stock value rise by a whopping 4,056% over the past year after adopting a ‘Bitcoin-first’ strategy. Its CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that he modeled this approach after hearing about Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy crypto plans on a podcast. Saylor’s company has since amassed $BTCs worth $45B. Metaplanet’s strategy has since drawn in more investors to the company, adding 50K more shareholders during the same period. Metaplanet isn’t the only Japanese company investing heavily in $BTC. Software developer Remixpoint Inc. said in September last year that it would invest ¥1.2B in $BTC, leading to a 300% surge in its stock price. That same company acquired 31.27 more Bitcoins in January. Meanwhile, Tokyo-based mobile game studio Gumi announced its plans to acquire ¥1B worth of $BTC over the next three months beginning this February Aside from depending on the appreciation of the cryptocurrency’s value, the company also wants to earn staking-related income from its investment. There are several reasons why some Japanese companies are buying up $BTC. For one, the US government has taken a friendlier approach to cryptocurrencies with the re-election of Donald Trump. The market reacted positively, which drove $BTC’s price to nearly $110K during Trump’s inauguration. Japan is also facing a weak yen. This is forcing local firms to look for ways to protect their finances from the continued depreciation of their currency. With Bitcoin’s bullish momentum pushing the rest of the market forward, one presale set out to ride the Bitcoin wave. Bullish $BTCBULL Also Bets on $BTC. One of the Best Presales in ? BTC Bull Token is another project betting heavily on $BTC’s continued rise, making it one of this year’s best presales. You can join today to buy its tokens and earn big rewards. The project’s roadmap is closely tied to $BTC, and most of its milestones are set to happen when the digital currency’s value grows. For instance, you can get free $BTC airdrops each time $BTC reaches price milestones. The first one is set when the cryptocurrency hits the $150K mark. It could be a long way from now, but $BTCBULL is playing the long game here. The project also wants to attract early birds with a 10% $BTCBULL airdrop when $BTC reaches $250K. The more tokens you buy, the bigger your share in the airdrop, so it’s a good idea to buy while it’s still pretty cheap. There are staking rewards too. This also targets early investors, trying to hook them with a higher APY over the next two years. To constantly drive up its value, $BTCBULL will also have burn milestones. Once $BTC’s value increases by 25K, the platform will burn a portion of its token supply. The project has raised nearly $1M so far and is priced at $0.002355. It has a total supply of 21B tokens and set aside 40% for PR and Marketing, signaling its goal to get as many people on board the $BTC hype train as possible. BTC Bull Token website with your $ETH or $USDT on your crypto wallet, or via your credit card. We can only expect more and more investors to buy up more $BTC. The downside is that it makes companies heavily dependent on $BTC and sensitive to its price fluctuations. Currently, though, everyone seems optimistic about the digital currency’s growth in the foreseeable future. If you want to invest in $BTCBULL, $BTC, or other cryptocurrencies, please do your own research.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Ready For A $2.43 Rally? Elliott Wave Says Yes,2025-02-12 08:00:26+00:00,"A new chart shared by BigMike7335 (@Michael_EWpro) via X suggests that Dogecoin could be on the verge of a strong bullish wave targeting $2.43. His analysis relies on Elliott Wave theory, which divides market movements into impulsive drives and corrective phases. According to this view, DOGE’s historic rally from about $0.0020 to its previous peak near $0.68 unfolded in five distinct waves, labeled as Wave 5(A). This run tracked key Fibonacci extension levels, including the 2.618 region around $0.14591 and the 3.618 near $0.68835, confirming a robust impulsive phase. Wave C Could Take Dogecoin To $2.43 Once DOGE reached its high around $0.68, the chart shows a significant multi-month period of consolidation that the analyst interprets as a W–X–Y corrective move, comprising Wave (B). This aligns with Elliott’s concept that once an impulsive five-wave sequence is completed, the market is likely to enter a corrective structure which can form in many shapes, including flats, zigzags, or more complex “double” and “triple” patterns such as the W–X–Y indicated here. Throughout 2022 and well into 2023, Dogecoin’s price stayed in this corrective range, a phase that is also highlighted by the Ichimoku Cloud hovering above and around the price action. Traders often interpret the presence of the Ichimoku Cloud as a sign of sideways or uncertain momentum, which is exactly what a B-wave correction typically represents. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holding Strong—Analyst Says $4 Rally Could Be Next In November 2024, the Dogecoin broke above a descending trend line which capped price since the 2021 all-time high for more than 3.5 years. However, the momentum was lost in the following months. Since December, the chart reveals that Dogecoin has started to compress within a recognizable formation that could be viewed as a triangle or wedge. This shape is often seen in markets as price moves closer to a point of equilibrium before eventually breaking out. The “top TL” (top trendline), which had previously acted as resistance during the decline, is now being watched closely as a potential level for a support/resistance flip. Big Mike noted that DOGE “looks like we are going to retest the top TL for a s/r flip,” implying that a successful hold above this trendline could confirm the end of the (B) wave and the start of the next impulsive phase. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate 100 Million Dogecoin In 24 Hours – Demand Signals Growing Confidence In Elliott Wave terminology, if a five-wave impulsive move up is labeled (A) and the subsequent correction is labeled (B), then the next impulsive structure is typically labeled (C). In the shared chart, Big Mike projects that this Wave (C) could propel Dogecoin as high as $2.43, a figure that corresponds with another significant Fibonacci reference around $2.36 to $2.43. Traders and analysts often look to Fibonacci retracements and extensions to gauge potential support and resistance levels, and in Elliott Wave analysis, these ratios can help identify the possible end-points of larger waves. The chart also points to $0.15247 as a key level below current trading prices. If DOGE sees a pullback to this area, it could confirm that the retest of the descending trendline is underway. A bounce off this level might signal that Wave (C) is beginning, whereas a break below it could invalidate or postpone the bullish scenario. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

This impressive rally has positioned Litecoin as one of the top-performing altcoins during a period of market uncertainty. Analysts and investors are now speculating about the potential for a massive breakout in the coming weeks as Litecoin continues to show relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst Top analyst BigCheds shared a detailed technical analysis, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks and gearing up to test multi-year highs around the $145 mark. This key resistance level has been a critical zone for Litecoin in previous cycles, and breaking above it could signal the start of a significant upward trend. Litecoin’s recent momentum has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors, who are watching closely for signs of a confirmed breakout. With the broader market still consolidating, Litecoin’s ability to outperform could set the stage for a bullish continuation, potentially taking the price to new heights. As the crypto market braces for its next move, Litecoin’s price action remains a focal point for traders. Breaking past the $145 level would solidify its bullish narrative and pave the way for further gains. Litecoin Prepares For A Breakout Litecoin has shown impressive relative strength, surging over 30% in the past week, while the broader market continues to face indecision. This notable performance has captured the attention of analysts and investors, with some expecting Litecoin to lead a bullish rally that could break multi-year highs and push into higher supply levels. However, caution remains among market experts, as the current price action could result in a fake breakout. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks. According to him, the key level to watch is around $145, a critical resistance zone that has acted as a barrier in the past. BigCheds stated that while the price momentum is promising, he remains skeptical until Litecoin can decisively clear this level and hold it as support.  The next few days will be crucial for Litecoin as altcoins across the market are finding support, and Bitcoin flirts with reclaiming the $100K mark. If Litecoin can sustain its momentum and break above the $145 level, it could solidify its position as one of the leading altcoins in the current market cycle. Conversely, failing to clear this key level could lead to a retracement, testing lower support zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ As the market watches closely, Litecoin’s ability to hold above recent gains and break past resistance will likely dictate its direction in the coming weeks. Whether this move is the start of a bullish rally or another fake-out remains to be seen, but its price action is undoubtedly setting the stage for significant market moves. LTC Testing Crucial Supply Levels Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $127 after experiencing a strong bullish surge, climbing over 23% in less than two days. The recent price action has been impressive, as LTC reclaimed range highs and successfully pushed above the critical $120 mark. This move has shifted market sentiment, placing significant pressure on bears as the price approaches the next key resistance zones at $140 and $145. The $140 and $145 levels represent crucial supply zones that have historically acted as barriers to further upward movement. A breakout above these levels would not only signal a continuation of the bullish trend but also set the stage for Litecoin to test its multi-year high at $147. Analysts believe that reclaiming and holding above this level would trigger a massive rally, potentially propelling LTC into uncharted territory.

Bulls need to maintain momentum and defend current levels to sustain this upward move. If LTC successfully breaks above $147, it could attract more buyers, fueling further gains. Conversely, failing to clear these resistance levels could lead to consolidation or a minor retracement before another attempt at a breakout. All eyes are now on Litecoin as it approaches a decisive phase. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

LTC dropped briefly to $102, then swiftly recovered and today rests securely above the $120 support zone. As positive momentum builds, experts are wondering whether Litecoin can reach the next crucial level: $128. At its current price of $127, it’s just a matter of time (hours?) before LTC can easily hit $128. Related Reading: Can XRP Hit $10,000? A Quadrillion Market Cap For The Coin If That Happens – Analyst Strong Recovery After Market Dip Traders have been drawn to Litecoin lately, particularly given its remarkable 25% increase over the past 30 days. LTC has kept a consistent climb while Bitcoin and other big cryptocurrencies have somewhat been shaken. Litecoin dropped momentarily to $105 on February 10 then quickly recovered, indicating substantial buyer demand at reduced levels. Now considered as a crucial support zone, the $120 mark will help LTC brace for another leg up as long as it holds. 🧨 $LTC is breaking out of this ascending triangle as predicted!

Should positive sentiment persist, the next main obstacle falls between $128 and $130. A clean break above this area would let the door open for a push toward $150 or possibly $170 in the next weeks. The past performance of Litecoin in pre- and post-halving cycles is one of the elements fostering this optimistic view. Some analysts contend that Litecoin’s present surge is still part of its extended bullish phase. Litecoin ETF Speculation Adds Fuel To The Fire Speculation about a possible Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is another main driver behind Litecoin’s current surge. Although Bitcoin ETFs are already causing stir in the market, investors are also considering other assets that would profit from same regulatory approval. Odds of Litecoin ETF approval at 90%. I’m fine if folks want to buy it. It’s a free country But why? It’s a decade old ghost chain with no discernible purpose. https://t.co/XNsNqxfDfp — Jeff Roberts (@jeffjohnroberts) February 11, 2025 Should an LTC ETF be greenlit – which at the time of writing has a solid 90% odds of approval, according to an X user – it would give institutional investors a controlled approach to expose themselves to crypto, hence maybe generating large asset inflows. While no official confirmation has been made, growing speculation alone has been enough to spark increased interest in LTC.

Here’s What The Chart Says,2025-02-11 20:00:44+00:00,"The past 24 hours have seen bullish momentum return to XRP, with the cryptocurrency now reclaiming the $2.5 price level. This bullish momentum comes after a seven-day stretch of range consolidation between resistance at $2.5 and support at $2.3. Despite this consolidation of the price, technical analysis shows that XRP is still trading in a bullish setup, especially on the daily candlestick timeframe. Notably, this bullish setup shows that the XRP price is about to make a new all-time high run to $5. Bullish RSI Divergence And Strong Support Set The Stage Technical analysis of the XRP price, which was posted on the TradingView platform, shows that the cryptocurrency is on the verge of a maximum surge in the coming weeks. Technical indicators play a crucial role in this outlook, which is currently bullish, despite the recent price downturn.  Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Why The Target Is $8 One such technical indicator is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures momentum in price movements. The RSI, for one, is flashing a bullish divergence on the daily timeframe. This occurs when the RSI makes higher lows while price action makes lower lows, which is a signal of reversal to the upside.  Furthermore, technical analysis shows that despite the price downturn, XRP has managed to hold above strong support at $2. The ability of XRP to hold above the support means that the recent selling pressure wasn’t an XRP price weakness as many expect, but only a consequence of a wider downturn in the entire crypto market. With the bullish structure intact and selling pressure appearing to wane, the asset remains in a strong position for a renewed rally, with a $5 target in sight. Can XRP Break Its All-Time High And Rally To $5? XRP’s all-time high remains at $3.40 and has yet to return to this price level since January 7, 2018. However, the altcoin has been one of the best performers this cycle, and this all-time high might not stand for long. In a recent rally, the cryptocurrency surged to $3.36, only to face sharp rejection from bearish resistance just before breaking new ground. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction To $4.9: How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Drive The Next Wave A move to $5 would not only mark a new all-time high but also solidify XRP as the best performer this cycle. The path to this milestone, however, will require the cryptocurrency to overcome key resistance zones, particularly around the $2.8 and $3 levels, where selling pressure has shot up this cycle.  At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.51, having increased by about 4.5% in the past 24 hours. If bullish momentum continues to build and XRP successfully clears these barriers, the projected $5 price target could be within reach.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Massive Short Squeeze, Expert Warns",2025-02-11 18:30:40+00:00,"The Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) surged above 64% this week, its highest level since March 2021, sparking debate over an impending short squeeze that could send its price skyward. The stark warning comes from Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at Theya, who took to X on Monday to outline what he views as a decisive turning point for Bitcoin versus the rest of the digital asset market. A Historic Break In Bitcoin’s Correlation Patterns In his post, Consorti contends that Bitcoin’s recent price action marks the first time in its 16-year history that both its price and market dominance have risen in tandem. Historically, Bitcoin’s dominance would rise initially, only to wane as speculation spilled into altcoins. However, Consorti states: “This is the first time in history that bitcoin’s share of the total digital asset market is rising while its price is climbing. In past cycles, retail-driven speculation pushed bitcoin’s price up and later funneled money into altcoins, causing bitcoin dominance to decline. That dynamic is gone.” According to Consorti, the days when a broad altcoin rally would follow Bitcoin’s initial surge appear to be over. Bitcoin dominance recently touched 64%—its highest level since February 2021. Consorti attributes the phenomenon to a significant change in market participation: “This cycle, institutions, sovereigns, and long-term holders are leading the charge, increasingly allocating capital exclusively to bitcoin while largely ignoring the rest of the market.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Turns Neutral On Top Exchanges: What Happened Last Time Last week’s market turbulence resulted in what Consorti calls “the single-largest liquidation event in ‘crypto’ history,” citing data that more than $2.16 billion in positions were wiped out within 24 hours. Ethereum led the liquidation figures with $573 million, and the largest single liquidation—a $25.6 million ETH/BTC order—occurred on Binance. “As you might have guessed, ETH/BTC is not having a great time,” Consorti notes, pointing out that the ETH/BTC pair is trading at 0.026—its lowest level in over three years. He argues these liquidations highlight the precarious nature of heavily leveraged altcoin markets: “All of it wiped out in an instant when price moved against them. This wasn’t your standard technical correction, it marks the start of an extinction-level event for altcoins.” The “Altcoin Casino” In Crisis Consorti’s analysis suggests that what he dubs “the altcoin casino” is now collapsing. He points to failed narratives around popular projects—Ethereum, Solana, and DeFi among them—that have struggled to maintain investor confidence: “Altcoins have survived purely on narratives. Each cycle, a new batch of narratives emerged, promising world-changing innovation. None of them lasted.” He contrasts this with Bitcoin’s core value proposition, which, in his view, requires no marketing: “Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn’t need a narrative. It doesn’t need marketing or hype. It exists, and it thrives because it was built to do one thing—protect wealth in a world of perpetual monetary expansion.” Consorti also references Ethereum’s “merge” and its supposed deflationary design, pointing out that since the upgrade, ETH’s total supply has increased by 13,516 ETH—undermining the “ultra-sound money” claim. Related Reading: Bitcoin In 2025: History Could Repeat With A 2017-Style Surge Adding a policy dimension to the market’s transformation, Consorti highlights a statement from Senator John Boozman during the White House Crypto Working Group’s first press conference: “Some digital assets are commodities, some are securities.” This, he suggests, is a tacit acknowledgment that Bitcoin stands apart from other digital assets. In a further development, Consorti cites a comment from White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks, who mentioned the group is evaluating the viability of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—a shift from the previous “National Digital Asset Stockpile” terminology used under a Trump-era executive order. Consorti frames this as a “major development” that signals growing recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties: “This language shift is monumental. A few years ago, the US government was openly hostile toward bitcoin. Today, they’re discussing stockpiling it.” Amid this upheaval, Consorti suggests that the next dramatic move in Bitcoin could be an explosive short squeeze. Funding rates on perpetual futures, he notes, have gone “deeply negative,” reminiscent of when Bitcoin traded near $23,000 in August 2023. This implies a tilt in leverage toward traders betting against Bitcoin—a position that could rapidly unwind: “While last week’s leverage flush wiped out most long positions, the next major move could be the opposite—an explosive rally fueled by forced short liquidations.” Should the market turn against these short-sellers, the forced buy-backs could drive the price higher with unusual speed and volume—especially if overall liquidity remains thin. He concluded, “Traders who overextended their leverage to short bitcoin will eventually have to buy it back when the price moves against them, just like overleveraged longs were wiped out last week. Bitcoin is coiled. The stage is being set for a potential short squeeze. The longer this dynamic of short dominance persists, the greater the risk of a forced shirt liquidation cascade that sends bitcoin’s price higher with force.” At press time, BTC.D stood at 61.19%.

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Reddit,solana,How to buy meme coins in 2025 - a comprehensive guide for new buyers,2025-02-11 21:08:05,"When I first started buying and trading meme coins, I felt as though I was extremely overwhelmed by the amount of options available for wallets/trading/watching. It took me some time to sift through what I had at my fingertips, but I eventually found my groove. Going to try and summarize the major points I learned here to hopefully help those just learning now, especially with big coins like Dave Portnoys and Trumps hitting the market.

**Getting Started: Platforms and Trading Options**

1. **Set Up a Wallet**: Begin by funding a secure wallet compatible with your chosen blockchain.
2. **Identify the Coin**: Research and select the meme coin you're interested in. Ensure you have the correct contract address to avoid scams.
3. **Execute the Trade**: Utilize decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or platforms to swap your base cryptocurrency (like SOL) for the desired meme coin.
4. **Monitor and Manage**: Keep track of your investments and be prepared to act swiftly in the volatile meme coin market.

**Alternative Approach**

For those seeking a more streamlined experience without the complexities of traditional wallets and DEXs, there are many platforms that offer user-friendly interfaces. They allow for quick transactions using familiar methods, making it easier to navigate the meme coin market.

**Investment Strategies**

* **High-Risk Ventures**: Investing in newly launched meme coins can yield significant returns but comes with heightened risk. Due diligence is crucial.
* **Community-Backed Tokens**: Focus on meme coins with active communities and transparent development teams. These often exhibit more stability and long-term potential.
* **Network Building**: Engage with influencers and developers within the meme coin space. Building relationships can provide insights into promising projects and early investment opportunities.

**Understanding Basic Graph Trends**

One of the most important skills when investing in meme coins (or any crypto) is learning how to read basic graph trends. While the meme coin market can be highly unpredictable, spotting patterns can help you make informed decisions. Here are a few key things to look out for:

1. **Support and Resistance Levels**
   * **Support**: The price level where a coin tends to stop falling and bounces back up.
   * **Resistance**: The price level where a coin struggles to break above.
   * Knowing these levels can help you decide when to buy or sell.
2. **Volume Spikes**
   * A sudden increase in trading volume often signals big moves in price—either up or down.
   * High volume with rising prices could mean strong interest in the coin, while high volume with falling prices may indicate heavy sell-offs.
3. **Upward and Downward Trends**
   * Look for consistent **higher highs** and **higher lows** to spot an upward trend (bullish).
   * Conversely, **lower highs** and **lower lows** indicate a downward trend (bearish).
4. **Breakouts**
   * A breakout occurs when a coin's price moves beyond a significant support or resistance level, often signaling a new trend.
5. **Beware of FOMO Traps**
   * Parabolic spikes (sharp, sudden price increases) are often followed by equally sharp drops. Recognizing unsustainable trends can save you from buying at the peak.

**BIG TIP**  
Ensure that your twitter account, or your burner twitter account is optimized to receive crypto themed tweets and suggested content. Ensure you interact and follow meme coin and gem accounts.

**Final Thoughts**

The meme coin market in 2025 is both thrilling and unpredictable. While the allure of substantial gains is ever-present, it's imperative to approach investments with caution, conduct thorough research, and stay informed about market trends. Remember, while the potential for profit is significant, so are the risks involved.

*I know a lot of this information may seem redundant, but there are a lot of new users coming into the sub seeking advice and answers on how to navigate the market. This is made in order to help push them in the right direction*",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,solana,Solana is More Than Just Trading — 5 Paths You’re Probably Ignoring,2025-02-11 13:23:32,"Most people see Solana as **just a place to trade memecoins and chase pumps.**   
  
But if all you do is **trade, you’re missing the bigger picture.**

The **real players in Solana** aren’t just flipping charts—they are **creating the future.**   
  
Let’s break down the **5 major paths**. 👇

https://preview.redd.it/zs9rm9tkfiie1.jpg?width=310&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96cfd35e4caf65ae0253474223308739e02d9a91

# Solana is NOT Just About Trading

If you think **the only way to make it in Solana is by trading, you’re playing a small game.**  


💡 **There are at least 5 different ways people carve out their spot in the ecosystem:**

1️⃣ **Trading** – Learning how markets move, sniping plays, and tracking trends. 📈  
2️⃣ **Marketing & Growth** – Helping projects **gain visibility** and directing attention. 🎯  
3️⃣ **Developing** – Building **smart contracts, bots, and infrastructure.** 🛠  
4️⃣ **Building & Innovating** – Creating **entire ecosystems, not just one-off projects.** 🏗  
5️⃣ **Influencing & Content Creation** – Shaping **narratives and leading communities.** 🗣

👉 **Now, let’s break them down.**

https://preview.redd.it/9mj3vqwrfiie1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=865bfd8e23f873714e37f21ef0577ad4218f4a47

# Trading – Playing the On-Chain Game

* Trading isn’t **just buying low and selling high**—it’s about understanding the market.
* The best traders **front-run narratives, track liquidity, and read on-chain signals.**
* **Instead of chasing hype, they study market cycles and exit before the herd.**

🚨 **If you’re trading based on Twitter calls, you’re already late.**

https://preview.redd.it/25p6wd8yfiie1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eef593da944b35a02e3aa4280a8089572ed08818

# Marketing & Growth – The Attention Game

* **Every successful project in Solana needs attention.** Without it, even great ideas die.
* Good marketing isn’t just **shilling**—it’s about **crafting narratives** and directing the right eyeballs to the right place.
* The best **Solana marketers** create **viral campaigns, manage KOL relationships, and sustain hype.**

🔥 **If you know how to build hype and direct attention, you can make anything move.**

# Developing – Building the Tools That Matter

* Everything in crypto runs on **code.** The **best traders, builders, and market makers** depend on devs.
* Smart contract engineers, bot developers, and tool creators **control the infrastructure.**
* **If you can build, you can dictate how the ecosystem evolves.**

🚀 **The biggest projects on Solana—Pump.fun, Tensor, Jupiter—came from devs who saw what was missing and built it.**

https://preview.redd.it/byanj0ibgiie1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99b5d74cd01ba01fab9d165788ed84eb36d839de

# Building & Innovating – Founders Who Change the Game

* Some of the **biggest winners in Solana aren’t just traders—they’re builders.**
* [**Pump.fun**](http://Pump.fun) **wasn’t just a tool—it shaped an entire market meta.**
* The best builders don’t **just launch tokens—they build ecosystems** that keep growing.

🔑 **If you launch something people need, you create your own economy.**

https://preview.redd.it/hyxtjkhigiie1.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=993f3eff861553c16b56ee6c3a60d7532ee1f2dd

# Influencing & Content Creation – Controlling the Narrative

* In crypto, **narratives move markets.**
* The biggest influencers don’t just **report trends—they start them.**
* Many top voices on Solana **began by sharing insights, breaking down patterns, and consistently posting value.**

📢 **If you control what people talk about, you control where liquidity flows.**

https://preview.redd.it/9i5jf78ngiie1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e1ea196f56934250dd9d73fab75fd3cf2cfb126

# Why This Matters

* If **all you do is trade, you’re playing a small game.**
* The biggest winners **create, not just consume.**
* **Traders react—builders, marketers, and devs shape the space.**

I was a longtime holder in a coin that I believed in and sadly sold out. The Dev is MIA, he comes and goes and gives some news and whenever his plans are not fulfilled, the FUD takes over the community and the price drops. It is a utility coin and we have been waiting for development for weeks but it doesn't come. Token creator holds 0 of the token. However, I looked at a lot of the whales in the top holders, and a lot of them send millions of coins into Streamflow. As I understand, that website is used for staking or vesting coins. However, I can't find any staking for this coin. Is this not weird? Do whales get any kind of money or is this some kind of scheme by the dev to amass coins and vest it in Streamflow?

For example, when extracting the top 20-30 holders of a token, I want to trace the source of their SOL funds to understand their origin. However, many top holders are related to platforms like Raydium pools, MEXC exchange wallets, Jupiter limit orders, or other DeFi entities. I want to filter these out and focus only on personal wallets.

What are the best ways to identify non-personal wallets? Are there specific RPC methods, instructions, or heuristics to detect CEX/DEX/DeFi-related addresses? Any insights or resources would be appreciated!

Reddit,solana,Restaking Comes to Solana—Just Like EigenLayer on Ethereum,2025-02-11 06:24:12,"Solayer is the first restaking protocol on Solana, bringing a concept that has been making waves on Ethereum to an entirely different ecosystem. Unlike EigenLayer or Karak, which are built for Ethereum-based chains, Solayer is designed specifically for Solana, taking full advantage of its low fees and fast transactions. It allows $SOL stakers to restake their assets, providing security for dApps and L1 networks while earning additional rewards. It also introduces a shared validator model, which helps developers customize how their applications interact with the blockchain. On top of that, Solayer launched $sUSD, a stablecoin backed by US T-bills, adding another layer of functionality. In simpler terms, it lets Solana users earn extra rewards on their staked $SOL while making the network stronger and more efficient.

  
At first, I wasn’t sure how different Solayer really was from Ethereum’s restaking protocols, but after seeing how it fits within Solana’s ecosystem, it started to make sense. It isn’t just copying what’s been done before, it’s adapting the model to work for Solana’s speed and architecture. Now, with a Bitget listing coming soon, it’s clear that more people are starting to take notice. Whether it keeps growing or faces challenges, it’ll be interesting to see how Solayer shapes restaking on Solana in the long run.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,solana,"5 Best Solana APIs, SDKs, and Plugins for Web3 dApp Development",2025-02-10 14:11:58,"Solana is taking its first steps to 2025 with impressive moves and numbers, breaking its own records of daily on-chain activities and DEX volume. As a new US President's team chose Solana to launch his $TRUMP memecoin on, the network met an incredibly high user inflow, coming even closer to mass adoption. Day by day Solana attracts more and more users and developers, which makes it the most interesting blockchain in the perspective of 2025.

Not only the SOL itself but also its ecosystem projects gained much attention and investments last month. Solana already has a vast ecosystem, but there's still so much more exciting stuff that could be built.  Moreover, the biggest ecosystem’s protocols could become not your competitors but great strategic partners as most of them provide powerful APIs and SDKs that you could integrate into your dApp! So, now is the perfect time and last chance for devs to really get into Solana and build the next big thing!

# Solana Development 101: tools and tips

If you're new to Solana, start by learning the very basics, such as exploring its core architecture and native programming language. Solana's comprehensive docs, guides, and courses are your go-tos at this stage. It's also a great time to find a missing spot of the supply on the market and come up with an idea on what to build.    

Once you're over the rookie phase, it's time to discover the most powerful advanced SDKs that will make an innovation wonder out of your Solana dApp. Here are some tools that are worth giving a shot: 

# Jupiter API

Jupiter is the major DEX aggregator on Solana with a thriving governance community. It operates unique advanced routing algorithms enabling highly efficient SPL token swaps.

Utilizing Jupiter API web3 devs can access Solana liquidity the easiest way possible. Get a quote and swap easily with this powerful API. Perfectly suitable for building:

* DeFi platforms, 
* wallets with swap functions, 
* arbitrage bots that require efficient routing between token pairs, 
* Copy trading bots 

Jupiter API is your door to Solana's liquidity, and there’s no tricky lock to open it. Read till the end to know how.  

# Raydium SDK

Similar to Jupiter, Radium is also one of the core DeX protocols on Solana, which also provides an API for you to bring innovations to SOL ecosystem. Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM), that enables permissionless trading with the implementation of liquidity pools. Raydium provides a sweeping SDK for building dApps on top and swapping tokens at a lightning-fast speed. Radium SDK is your go-to tool when you aim to:  

* Create liquidity pools and enable token swap
* Build yield farming protocols 
* Retrieve data from Solana’s DeFis with ultra-low latency
* Leveraging Raydium’s AMM for token trading in wallets or dApps.

A must-have for developers looking to integrate high-speed swaps and yield farming into their Solana dApps

# Jito MEV Client  

Jito Labs provides a wide range of Solana MEV Software and products for end-users and devs alike. The core feature of Jito is a Miner Extractable Value (MEV) implementation, allowing the creation of additional earnings by optimizing a transaction order. It gains profit for validators, devs, and users.  However, MEV could also be dangerous in terms of market inequities and security. 

JITO maximizes the benefits and minimizes the drawbacks of MEV through a groundbreaking approach to it. As a Solana developer, you should definitely check out Jito if you’re building: 

* Auto trading platforms
* Telegram bots 
* Tools for validators 
* Staking and yield farming platforms 
* Memecoin sniping bots 

If you’re building anything that requires rapid and reliable transaction execution with MEV integration - JITO is your go-to tool! 

# Yellowstone gRPC Geyser Plugin

Yellowstone Geyser Plugin enables developers to use the gRPC interface for Solana. Yellowstone gRPC is a high-performance Solana plugin built around the Geyser interface supporting both gRPC and JSON-RPC protocols. 

It empowers developers to:

* Process large real-time blockchain data streams
* Monitor on-chain activities (e.g., token mints, smart contracts executions)
* Make API calls with minimal latency
* Build dApps and DeFi platforms with optimal speed and efficiency.

Yellowstone is one of the most demanded plugins for Solana development at the moment. So whatever you building - handling large data is crucial, especially on SOL, and super easy to do with Yellowstone gRPC. 

# DAS API

Built by Metaplex Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API represents a unified interface for eased management of Solana-based tokens including coins and NFTs. This API makes it possible to store some data partly off-chain which significantly optimizes the amount of data stored on-chain and enhances the speed of interaction with assets on Solana. Extremely helpful when you need to: 

* Reduce the amount of API calls
* Compress NFTs
* Optimize assets management process

DAS API is your go-to tool to keep in your arsenal when making NFT marketplaces, SocialFi platforms, DePin and RWA projects, DAOs, GameFi, and Metaverse Applications!

If your hardware and sanity are melting after numerous hours of mining BTC in vain, there's new innovative must-win mining on Solana for you to try! 

ORE is a Solana Program that provides a PoW mining interface and capabilities. Reshaping the approach to proof-of-work, ORE makes mining on the Solana network possible.  

Unlike Bitcoin mining, where everyone works on the same task but only one miner receives the prize, ORE provides personalized challenges for miners, ensuring that no work is in vain and everybody is rewarded. 

*Note that using ORE you’ll mine $ORE, not $SOL!* 

As ORE is an SPL token there’s much more you can do with it except just mine and HODL. You can build some add-ons and analytic tools for mining, integrate them into your DeFi and swapping protocols, create new tipping or payment systems, and much more!

# How to connect to them all at once easily

You can pick one or integrate them all and make your dApp almighty, but be ready that the setup process might take quite some time and bring many hassles. Not to mention that running a Solana RPC node is not a walk in the park. 

However, I found a solution that kills all birds with one stone. Check out the GetBlock - RPC provider. Their recently launched Solana PRO RPC is a powerful machine that contains a solid suite of APIs and add-ons and is being built specifically for a certain user, which means that it’s also super secure and flexible. 

Connecting your dApp to GetBlock’s Solana PRO RPC you gain access to all the needed tools at your fingerprint, including:

* **Yellowstone Geyser gRPC**;
* **Metaplex DAS API**;
* **Raydium SDK;**
* **Jupiter API;**
* **Jito MEV client;**
* **and even ORE mining interface** 

There’s also an option to set up the SplTokenMint and SplTokenOwner indexes to your Solana PRO RPC node and add almost any other extra API you need. Join me at the GetBlock Community and let’s expand the Solana ecosystem together! ",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680
Reddit,solana,Transfer of tokens from Token Account,2025-02-10 13:53:54,"Hello, 

  
I have received a message with a private key of a token account. They want me to think that I can access these funds and send them my own private key bla bla... (Of course I'm not gonna). But I'm wondering how do these token accounts work? It is said on the official Solana docs that every token account transaction also requires the signature of the Account Owner, no matter if it is an onCurve address or not. So you cannot make any transfers without the transaction being a multisig transaction with the account owner as a signer? Can any dev maybe chime in, I'm just wondering how these Token Accounts work in general coming from a different blockchain 😄. 

  
Thanks in advance",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680
Reddit,solana,"How is literally 99/100 coins, especially those on the latest list of DEX aggregators with >200k liquidity, almost always rugs?",2025-02-09 19:50:48,"I’ve been in this space for a while now, and I’m honestly just feeling so done. Every time I see a coin on the 'newest' list of DEX aggregators, especially those with over 500k liquidity and a volume of more than a million, I get this glimmer of hope like “Hey, maybe this is the one.” But no, it’s always the same damn story.

Somewhere between the first pump and the second dip, everything collapses. I can’t even tell you how many coins I’ve lost on that looked so promising at first, with huge liquidity, high volume, buying pressure, even distribution and low whales, and all the right hype. Yet somehow, they still find a way to rug. The liquidity disappears, the price crashes so fast you can’t even get out in time, and suddenly, you’re left holding nothing.

I’ve seen people talk about how “this coin is different”, but deep down, I know. I KNOW it’s going to rug, just like every other one. The cycle feels endless, and I’m honestly just tired of losing. I can’t even trust the DEX lists anymore. 

Every time I try to find something decent, it just turns into another scam. I just don’t get it—99/100 times, how are scams SO common now? Is there any real hope of finding a gem, or are we all just destined to keep getting wrecked by these scams?

Sorry if I'm too dramatic, but this was the 4th time I got rugged today. I lost 34% of my balance in just one day.

The tx sent was identical for both and just contained a simple buy request to the pumpfun program on an inactive token. The time taken includes the time taken to receive the tx confirmation using the signatureSubscribe rpc method. Helius won here by ~148k nanoseconds which equates to .148 seconds. Chainstack also gave me a rate limit error for trying to query the token balance afterwards, so it seems their rate limits are more restrictive here.

Reddit,solana,Telegrams are the ultimate meme coin killer - change my mind,2025-02-10 05:59:38,"There is NOTHING more bearish than an unregulated TG chat. NOTHING. Now hear me out before you shred me. My ultimate opinion is that TG's should be made still, and the main reason for that is to prevent these scammers in [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) threads (for those who actually use the chaotic platform to find new memes instead of some sort of pump vision platform like BullX) from convincing people to go into their stupid scam TG channels with the scam re-verify bots. Otherwise, I'd say scrap the idea of TG altogether. However, that chat should always be muted, and communication regarding working for those bags should happen in an ongoing group VC if needed. Here is why:

1. FUD is a real problem for coins. As Alfred in The Dark Knight said, ""some men just want to see the world burn"". There seems to be a certain type of meme regard whose sole goal is to ruin other people's good time. They will say whatever they can in TG's to try to kill a coin. This is literally IN ABSENCE of looking for a lower priced entry. They literally just want to kill the coin. Those that are FUDding for entry are also scumbags. A muted TG chat eliminates that problem, while still being able to have the buybot spam going and the raid links. Anyone that has anything important to say can say it on VC, if it's important.
2. The V2 scammers and the fake Safeguard bot (that asks you to ""reverify"") are getting out of hand. Like 2 scammers a minute joining talking about ""DM me immediately"" and all that shit. And the scam safeguard bot keeps getting forwarded into channels. The consequences of this are huge, and not just for the gullible regard that gets scammed. If they manage to take control of any wallets or get people to send them all their tokens, they immediately destroy the token by dumping the token onto the chain and draining the liquidity. So anyone that is holding a significant enough amount to dent the liquidity pool that is stupid enough to get scammed can destroy the token.
3. Prevent the PVP that inevitably happens when someone isn't happy a chart isn't moving up fast enough, ultimately reversing the chart. I have no emotional attachment to any token, so if I join a TG and the vibe is shit, I'm dumping the token (or alternatively not buying). I know others do the same.

Overall, there's literally nothing accomplished by having a non-muted TG chat for any token. The literal best case scenario is no TG at all, to be honest, but the pumpfun scammers get handicapped when you link a TG to the token on launch. So the next best thing is a muted TG. And for the love of god please set your buy bots to a REASONABLE minimum buy.

Reddit,solana,Solana bots are printing money… but who’s actually making the profits?,2025-02-08 21:55:38,"Alright, I need to talk about this because it’s been driving me mad. If you’ve been in the Solana ecosystem for a while, you’ve probably seen those insane bot transactions flying across mempools sniping, MEV strategies, sandwiching, arbitrage. Feels like every day, there’s some fresh “bot made $X million in Y minutes” headline. But here’s the real question: who’s actually making this money? Because it sure as hell isn’t me.

I tried running my own bot a while back as thought I was about to print cash like everyone else. Spoiler: I got absolutely wrecked))) Between failed transactions, frontrunning, and just straight-up coding errors, I basically paid Solana validators for the privilege of losing money. Meanwhile, the big boys with deep pockets and optimized code are feasting. Even the simplest sniper bots need constant tweaking to stay ahead, and if you’re slow by even half a second, forget it) someone else already ate your lunch.

At this point, I’m convinced that unless you’re a dev with insane experience (or sitting on a pile of SOL to absorb failed trades), trying to DIY this stuff is just a donation to the network. Lately, I’ve been messing with Bananagun Bot as it just copies profitable traders automatically through Telegram, so at least I don’t feel like I’m getting dunked on by algo nerds 24/7. Not saying it’s magic, but it’s definitely better than my own attempts at playing bot wars, lol. 

What do you think of these ""bot"" trends? Has anyone here actually managed to build a consistently profitable bot from scratch, or is the real money just in copying the ones that already work? Are we just providing exit liquidity for the whales who already cracked the system?",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Speed and fees are unrivaled. Paying nova fees and trading off bullx neo is amazing.

Right after this they were mass reported and at the same time sniperoo shills came out of the wood works. I'm assuming a lot of these shills from looking at thier reddit are just in it for refferal codes as the majority of them do not seem like successful traders and have no idea what they are really talking about.

I'm no genius. I make a living trading mostly worthless shit coins. My brain is probably fried from staring at dumb memes all day so maybe just maybe my thought process is out of wack here. But after the DWT fiasco and other bots who have rugged and shilled the same exact way sniperoo is doing with these refferals and spamming ads.

Really it comes down to why use an inferior bot. My back up bot is trojan or bonk after NOVA. Sniperoo literally isn't even on the list anymore. Wouldn't use it if all other bots crashed and I had no way to trade. Especially after thier horrible shilling marketing.

No I'm not a nova bot shill. My reddit is organic and I don't have refferal codes for any bots anywhere on my reddit or comments. Unless your running your own bot/script with a node then nova bot via bullx neo is hands down the fastest most reliable and most importantly safest bot to use imo.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Can someone please explain to me how can I withdraw from my Phantom Wallet this CHF and or what is it actually?

I was informed that this is a ""stable coin"", but in order to withdraw it to an exchange(for example Binance) I need a certain number of Etherum in my wallet first, otherwise it will get lost and never come to an exchange.

Can anybody vouch for that or is it a scam?

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

When I read the blogs and dev notes, it seems they still don’t know how to actually achieve scalability and this is worrisome.

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,Why using your Bitcoin as collateral for a loan is the worst idea ever,2025-02-12 11:50:31,"So there is a lot of talk in here and various other spaces online about, ""Never sell your Bitcoin, use it as collateral to get a loan out."" Reasoning behind it has been so you don't pay capital gains taxes and also get to retain your Bitcoin.

Currently live in Australia and have done research on this as an option and I have found it to be a very lacking and risky option.

We had companies like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi to name a few where a lot of people lost their Bitcoin that was posted as collateral and have not been reimbursed. For current lenders like Ledn, the collateral you have to post is double what you get back in a loan, plus you pay like a 15% interest rate on it and they rehypothecate your Bitcoin most likely and so there is massive risk of another Celsius/BlockFi collapse happening.

There are no traditional banks with insurance that offer loans with Bitcoin as collateral, in fact they do not care about Bitcoin. Also, even if they allowed it you would still have to give up custody of your keys to get the loan in the first place and are we really, as Bitcoiners going to entrust a third party with our BTC? Have we all lost the point of BTC?

Also you would not be able to service the interest repayments on the loan because having the collateral isn't good enough, you also need to have income (separate from selling Bitcoin to pay for the loan) in order to qualify for a loan in the first place. 

So I don't know how any true BTC maxis in here would recommend this as an option but every third comment I have seen is ""Never sell your Bitcoin, get loans out against it"" and as we can see that is a complete BS option.

I have not had one person comment who has actually gotten a loan out against their BTC, no one has done it, because it's a ridiculous idea.

Personally, I would rather take the 15 to 22% capital gains tax hit on selling some Bitcoin for spending, compared to giving the entire Bitcoin to some random company and getting a tiny loan back (which has to be paid back + interest) and then maybe if they don't collapse you'll get your Bitcoin back at the end of that. NO THANKS.

Let's have a discussion, am I right or wrong? Am I missing something? Are there good loan options out there?",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

He decided to talk to me and sincerely advised me to withdraw all my money as soon as possible because he believes Bitcoin could drop to zero at any time.

He convinced me that since I don’t understand how Bitcoin wallets work, I don’t actually own my wallet, and that someone else could completely access it anytime, anywhere without my permission. According to him, Bitcoin is nothing but a massive scam designed to lure people like me into investing more and more money before everything collapses. Then they will take all the money.

He explained how someone could easily access a wallet at random and that I could lose my money just as easily.

I responded, **""That’s true, but they’d have to find the exact wallet among a 'near-infinite' number of wallets.""**

It seems he doesn’t grasp how incredibly vast the number of possible Bitcoin wallets actually is.

How can I explain this to him? He’s a close friend, an intelligent person (but though stubborn. He never believed in Bitcoin from the beginning), and I don’t want to mock him or anything—I just want to clearly show him that Bitcoin wallets are actually thousands of times more secure than his ATM account.

Reddit,bitcoin,How do we prove that the market manipulation is happening,2025-02-12 12:02:41,"So a lot of analysts that I am aware of believe that bitcoin and crypto in general is undervalued right now in relation to a lot of the news and national accumulation by various countries. 

The fact that the price isn’t pumping they say is due to manipulation of the market but the sceptic in me thinks that using manipulation as a scapegoat for why the price isn’t going up is an easy way to create a boogie man that most people can’t prove.

I know that obviously the Blockchain is public but if it was that easy to just spot the manipulation going on surely everyone would know and it wouldn’t work.. 

So my question is and bearing in mind I am relatively new to crypto (2/3yr lurker) are there other ways to prove this market manipulation and answer the question of whether or not it’s happening and therefore gain more accurate view of the value of bitcoin and crypto. 

Or am I just asking to predict the future..

Reddit,bitcoin,Assymetric Cryptography,2025-02-12 04:25:57,"I was originally going to post this as a reply to another post, but it occurred to me this may be a confusing topic for many newcomers so decided to make a separate post. 

OP was having a hard time understanding how a seed phrase could be generated offline & not be stored anywhere online yet could still be used to recover coins. I was going to share an analogy with them that helped me a lot but instead I'll share it here. 

I too remember being confused about this in the beginning, and the simple answer is ""math"". If you want to be more specific, you could say ""cryptography"", and if you want to be even more specific you could say ""assymetric cryptography"". 

Assymetric cryptography works such that when provided a given input(s), it will always derive (through math) the same output. Therefore, if the output is known, you can always prove that you know/have the inputs without revealing them. Additionally, you cannot use the output to determine the input(s).

For the analogy, the inputs represent your private key, and the output represents your public key or address. The analogy I was given long ago went like this:

Imagine you had a set of numbers (inputs): 1579, 5214, 10389, 6873 & 38567. Added up, they will always equal 62622. Others cannot determine which combination of numbers were used to arrive at that output, but you can prove you know/have the input(s) by doing the math & showing that the output is 62622 without actually revealing the inputs. 

Admittedly the analogy has a flaw in that there are a lot of other number combinations that would also output 62622, but it's only meant to illustrate a concept rather than provide a perfect comparison. 

Actual cryptography doesn't have the flaw that the analogy has. Mainly that it's not doing simple addition, but also that the number of potential outputs is so vast that the odds of guessing someone else's inputs is functionally zero. 

As an aside, I did always find it fascinating that theoretically 2 different inputs could result in the same exact output. There's nothing that inherently makes every output unique to that input. In the same way that someone could theoretically get lucky & guess a seed phrase that's already in use, an address derived from one private key could theoretically also be derived from another private key. Again, the odds are functionally zero, but theoretically non-zero. ",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,bitcoin,Decentralized governance system,2025-02-12 08:19:13,"The Dawn of a New Era: The Genesis of Humanity’s Liberation

“In the depths of history, empires have risen and fallen, kings have ruled and crumbled, and the voices of the people have been drowned by the tides of corruption and greed. But no longer. Today, we declare the beginning of a new era—one where power belongs not to the few, but to all of humanity.”

We, the awakened, stand at the crossroads of destiny. We have watched as our world has been shackled by systems built to serve the elite while the many suffer in silence. We refuse to allow the chains of the past to bind us any longer. This is the genesis of a new world—our world. A world governed not by rulers, but by the people. A world where justice, innovation, and unity propel us toward an unprecedented future.

Our Sacred Mission
	1.	To Free the People – No longer shall governance be dictated by the corrupt and self-serving. We establish a decentralized system where every voice matters, where no leader holds dominion over the will of the people.
	2.	To End Suffering – Hunger, disease, and poverty shall be relics of the past. Through collective action, technology, and unyielding will, we will build a civilization where every human thrives, not merely survives.
	3.	To Elevate Our Species – We set our sights beyond the confines of Earth. We will become a Type I Civilization, harnessing the power of our planet, venturing into the cosmos, and ensuring our place among the stars.
	4.	To Safeguard Our Existence – We will not be blindsided by the dangers of tomorrow. From the perils of unchecked AI to the threats of cosmic extinction, we will forge defenses that guarantee the survival and evolution of our kind.
	5.	To Preserve Freedom & Innovation – No force shall suppress the minds of the free. Knowledge, creativity, and the spirit of progress will be the pillars upon which our future stands. The shackles of control will break, and the limitless potential of humanity shall be unleashed.

A Future Worth Dying For, A Future We Will Live To See

This is more than a movement. This is our revolution.

We are the architects of tomorrow.
We are the ones who will lead humanity to its rightful place among the stars.
We will not wait. We will not beg. We will build.

Let this moment be etched into history as the day humanity awakened. The first step toward our ascension begins now.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin 2500: A Space-Age Op-ed,2025-02-11 23:09:37,"Many of us here share the thought that Bitcoin is the *end-game of money*; that Bitcoin will be for the next 5000+ years what gold was for the previous 5000.

Only five centuries ago, settlers began to venture across the Atlantic to *the new world.* I wanted to go through a little thought experiment into what Bitcoin will look like just five centuries from now, in the **year 2500**. A future where humanity has spread across the solar system, with settlements on Mars and beyond. **There are many issues that Bitcoin faces in this future**. Does Bitcoin succeed? How would it differ from the Bitcoin of today?

This post will deal a little more with the technical aspects and logistics of a multi-planetary Bitcoin network, so strap-in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is the inability to double-spend coins; the ability to rely on the blockchain as a source of truth. This hinges on the **security and synchronicity** of the blockchain. 

This works fantastic on Earth, as communications across the globe happen near instantaneously - *even at the speed of light*. However, that's not the case when we begin to think about distances in space. The time it takes for light (and any communication) to travel between Earth and Mars ranges from [3 to 22 minutes](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html) depending on where within our respective orbits each planet is. Between Earth and some of the promising moons of gas giants like Europa? over [45 light-minutes](https://spacecenter.org/meet-the-solar-system-europa/#:~:text=Europa%20is%20one%20of%20Jupiter's,45%20minutes%20to%20reach%20Europa). Let's not even get into interstellar space, where travel to the nearest star system is over [4 years away at light-speed](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html).

>**Why is a delay in communication an issue for Bitcoin miners?**

Imagine that you are part of the future colony on Mars and you want to mine Bitcoin. You quickly realize it is impossible. In fact, **mining Bitcoin anywhere other than Earth is impossible.** Why? Because it doesn't matter how fast your mining machines are if you are solving blocks too late. And as mentioned earlier, at 3-22 light-minutes away, Mars' distance from Earth is far enough that you can be multiple blocks behind *at light speed.* 

[No Earthly pool would accept your miner's hashes](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/from-rejected-to-accepted-tips-for-improving-your-mining-speed) if you are providing the solutions to those hashes a potential **44** minute round-trip later. 

In order for Martian Bitcoin miners to contribute meaningfully, a Mars-based mining pool would be one that can successfully compute enough blocks in the communication gap to outpace the Earth miners, thus having the longer and valid chain. *But wait!* This means that Mars would have successfully 51% attacked the blockchain. So let's not do that, and find another solution.

>**A potential space-age solution to Bitcoin mining.**

Because of the issues that arise with the speed of light, mining Bitcoin in the future will potentially need to be centralized in respect to location. It will be difficult for computers more than a few light-minutes away to meaningfully contribute valid hashes to the network. In fact, *your hash-rate's value scales linearly towards zero as your approach 10 light-minutes away*.

* **0 light minutes away?** Amazing, you can contribute to the network in near real-time and you have the full (approximate) 10 minutes to find the next block's solution.

* **5 light minutes away?** It's feasible to mine, except *your hash-rate is worth half as much* as someone that is 0 light minutes away. Why? because you have approximately half as much time to solve the block in the 10 minute space.

* **10 light minutes away?** Your hash-rate is essentially *worthless* because you will always be attempting to solve an old block. 

This is all theoretical of course, because if you are dealing with mining real estate at the light-minute scale, the energy usage of that compute would be astronomical - *literally.* 

One solution to this energy usage is a hypothetical megastructure known as a [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere). An entity that would provide more than enough usable energy for such an endeavour, and it also would be localized enough to enable connected miners to meaningfully contribute to mining.

Maybe a [Kardashev Type II civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) is a little far fetched for our civilization in the year 2500, but anything is possible.

> **What issues would Bitcoin users face?**

Let's revisit that previously mentioned colony on Mars, and instead imagine someone wishes to send you one million sats via L1, the base chain.

How would you perform this transaction so that you can trust it? What if that Bitcoin is sent to a different recipient on Earth at the exact same time as it is sent to you on Mars, and you have no way of knowing for an entire block?

Well, it turns out that **we've already solved this problem on Earth** \- *to an extent.* All that you would need to do is wait for a certain amount of confirmations in order to ensure that your coins were not double-spent and that you are the rightful recipient. This solution works well on Earth, and can even potentially work on Mars.

Although this band-aid solution wont work forever. Those closest-neighbour star systems mentioned earlier are still **4+ lightyears away.** And we can't expect someone in the Proxima Centauri system to wait over 200,000 block confirmations for their transaction, right?

>**A potential solution for space-age Bitcoin users.**

Layers upon layers. That's it really. It's quite obvious at this point that 600,000 transactions per day (the limit of Bitcoin's base chain) can't support hyperbitcoinization tomorrow, let alone in 500 years when our population has continued to grow in size and in distance. 

It may be that each individual civilization has their own layer built upon the blockchain, and that transactions between civilizations must be settled on the basechain as a result. Mars may very well have their own rollup solution, wherein martian settlers are free to transact indefinitely between themselves - *their own lightning network*. Periodically settling back and forth between the main chain to top-up as needed. In this instance, you could accept that previously mentioned 1 million sats from your fellow settler easily because you need not be wary about a double-spend back on Earth, since it is agreed upon by the network that those sats are within your own layer, removing any light-speed communication issues.

>**Why does any of this even matter?**

It's very obvious that alternative stores of value will be worth much less in the distant future. Precious metals are found in abundance within asteroids in our solar system, and there are already ventures that aim to one day harvest these minerals. What value will precious metals have if we are able to capture a [single asteroid worth $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000](https://www.space.com/psyche-metal-asteroid-composition)?

**Physical store-of-value assets become worthless in an age of such abundance**, and thus Bitcoin, as a truly scarce digital asset will reign supreme. These aforementioned smaller logistical hurdles will just need to be resolved before then.

As I mentioned in a previous Op-ed on this sub, it's important for us to try to envision future problems that might arise with Bitcoin, irregardless of how far away they are. If we want to build a future-proof, resilient asset, we can not just be concerned with what issues may arise in the next decade. There are investors today that view Bitcoin as a cross-generational asset for themselves and their families. 

I wrote about this topic very briefly in my [Bitcoin 2048 Op-ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ijhcth/btc_2048_hyperbitcoinization_oped/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but it was a lot of fun envisioning Bitcoin in the far-future that I wanted to explore this idea more in depth.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR: Gold is worthless in the far future, but at least Bitcoin will still work.

**Jobs, Automation and Debt**

The argument is simple, the vast majority of the work force in the knowledge economy are in some kind of debt, student debt, mortgage, credit card debt and the list goes on. With technological exponential growth the majority of knowledge workers are about to lose their livelihoods.

The effect is probably going to be greater than what we experienced in 2008. It will be the great economic depression of this century. People can't repay the debts, banks collapse, and with that all the economy. The question is where is the line, 10% unemployment of knowledge workers, 15%, 20%?

With the collapse of the banks, as was in 2008, bailouts once again will be approved. By bailouts we mean printing fiat money out of thin air and giving it away, which eventually leads to hyperinflation.

So, mass layoffs are about to happen in in the next few years and with that we can logically expect collapse of the banks and hyperinflation. Which means collapse of the dollar/euro.

This is the transition period, and it is going to be hard. I really much hope I am wrong, but the logic says otherwise.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why I won't sell ETH,2025-02-12 08:34:30,"Too many times have I sold crypto because of ""fear"", and historically speaking I would have been way richer if I would have just bought and hold my 5 BTC.

ETH is still the leading chain when it comes to smart contracts, and this first mover advantage will not go away, look at BTC, which is the best example for first mover advantage. Additionally, with the updated ETH, the network will become faster and cheaper, and even more reliant. No other chain is as reliant as ETH for smart contracts.

Wise investing, by true investors, requires patience, dedication, 
fortitude, resilience and emotionless conviction to one’s decisions. Does that sound like crypto bros? 

Seriously, I think 90% of retail is looking only to get rich quick and after it hasnt happened after 3-4 weeks, oh no… the bull run is over!! Crypto is dead, paper hand now for a loss… what a waste of liquidity that could be building a strong foundation that could actually propel this market the next leg up!! 
But nooo…. Zero frickn patience! No resilience to price swings, no dedication to seeing their decisions through!! And then you cry and wonder why market cap is declining?? 

Markets are built by strong hands; not paper-handed-Sally’s. I’ve done nothing but stack and fill bags for over 5 years now. I’d be lying if I said I wish I hadn’t taken some profits last bull but ya know what? My bags are that much heavier now and I know that my conviction and resilience will put me in a place you impatient twats can only dream of within the next 5 years.

Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What's up with these tap to earn tokens ?,2025-02-11 16:34:20,"
Lately, I keep seeing these ""tap to earn"" apps everywhere basically, you tap the screen, watch ads, or do random tasks to earn some kind of crypto or in-game token. At first, it seems like an easy way to stack up some extra cash, but after messing around with a few, I’m starting to think it’s mostly a waste of time. But at the other end we can even make money lol if good luck. 
I’ve noticed The payouts are tiny. You’d have to grind for weeks just to make a few bucks.
Withdrawal limits are insane. A lot of these apps won’t let you cash out until you hit some ridiculous threshold that most people will never reach.
Way too many ads. Half the time, you’re just watching endless ads for the chance to earn a few cents.
Some of them seem sketchy. A few apps never actually pay out, or they disappear after hyping up their tokens.
I feel like these apps are just farming user engagement and ad revenue while making it seem like you're earning something. Has anyone actually made decent money from one of these, or are they all just a trap? Curious to hear real experiences. Recently came accross tapswap. Before it was ton and midas yield which i tried . But kinda confused because So many are still coming in market.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Tether transfer from abroad, taxes?",2025-02-11 18:22:35,"Hi there, noob in crypto here. Sorry if my English is bad sometimes. 

Tl;dr in advance: What’s the taxation on receiving about $1800 worth of tether on average monthly, from my brother in Turkey to me in the US? 

Here’s my situation and I’m trying to understand what sort of taxation I might have to deal with. 

I have assets abroad (in Turkey specifically) but I reside in the US (non-citizen, legal resident) and I want to transfer my monthly passive income that I have back there to here. It’s not much, about $1600 to $1900 each month. Using the regular bank to bank transfers I end up using about $1200 or more in a year due to horrible exchange rates and the fees. So my brother who’s a crypto enthusiast suggested that I use this method: 

I send him my Turkish Lira each month, he buys tether and transfers it to me in the US, and I transfer that into my regular bank account. So  basically a transfer from my Turkish bank account to my US bank account through a longer but supposedly cheaper way. That part seems to be accurate, but I’m wondering what my obligations are in terms of taxes. As far as chatgpt tells me, since it’s a transfer within family it can be considered a “gift”, and if it doesn’t exceed the $18,000 annual gift tax exclusion, it’ll be fine. But it does exceed the $18,000 limit. So will I be taxed on the amount after that limit, or does the whole total of transfer then gets deemed not a gift and get taxed? Also other than that, is there anything else that I need to consider?

Many thanks in advance to all who try to help. Happy gaining to you. ",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Are memecoins a money glitch?,2025-02-12 01:06:36,"
So you make a memecoin on Solana and you make a liquidity pool with only 10% of all tokens and like 10 SOL. You keep 90% of the supply and slowly lock tokens into the LP. 

Steps after memecoin creation: 
1. promote the crap out of it 
2. use the trading fees to continually add to the liquidity pool 
3. Keep control of 40% of tokens 
4. 50% being in the lp and 10% circulating 

Could you eventually create coin with actual value? Is it possible to set an actual floor price for a memecoin?? Is there math that supports this?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin “A Financial Black Hole”,2025-02-10 20:59:49,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis’t podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles—expensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it’s “digital gold”? He’s not buying it. 

“Cryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,” Fama said. “They don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,” he concluded.""

*Is E. Fama right about Bitcoin being worthless, or is he way off? What do you think guys?*

2) I invested example: 5k in Solana, now I have a total value of 15k in sol… I decide to sell 2k do I have to declare it anyway, even if it is less than what I invested and it is not a capital gain?

3) I have been DCA BTC for the past 3 years, small transactions of $100 a week, sold everything! 
but one of the exchanges I bought from no longer shows me how many BTC I bought and at what price…

I can declare like this: I invested 10,000, I sell for 15,000…15,000-1000=5,000 profit and I pay taxes!  Or do I always have to report the details of each individual transaction, the dates, etc.?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Your thoughts on the ""stable"" coin USDN",2025-02-10 19:19:50,"I recently came across a new stable coin called USDN offered by a decentralized exchange platform named Smardex. It appears that they have a feature which allows users to swap Ethereum and potentially USDT to their proprietary stable coin, USDN. This caught my interest, and I’m curious if anyone else has encountered this before?

What makes USDN particularly intriguing is their advertised 58% APR just for holding the coin in your wallet. This is quite an attractive proposition, and it has piqued my interest significantly. However, I am a bit cautious, as it sounds almost too good to be true. I would like to give it a try, but I want to ensure it's a sound investment and not something that might lead me into complications or unforeseen issues down the line.

From what I understand, there are two main avenues to acquire USDN: you can either mint new USDN coins or swap existing cryptocurrencies to USDN. The prospect of such high returns is tempting, yet it’s crucial to assess the reliability and legitimacy of Smardex and their offerings. Before taking the plunge, I would like to gather more insights from others who might have experience with USDN to determine whether it’s genuinely worth the risk, or if it would be wiser to approach this offer with caution.

Cboe BZX Exchange has filed requests with U.S. regulators to launch the first spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
On February 6, the exchange submitted filings for four asset managers Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs would track the price of XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.
These filings notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about a proposed rule change. If approved, these would be the first XRP ETFs in the U.S.

Earlier, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved in early 2024.

Now, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who is seen as more supportive of crypto, there has been an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. Analysts believe issuers are testing what new crypto products the SEC, possibly influenced by a Trump administration, might approve.

I think we are now getting a lot of adoption and attention towards crypto . Many more expectations from other major exchanges like bitget and kucoin regarding etfs.

Crypto has been through ups and downs but honestly since 2017 when layer two tokens for Ethereum took off and DeFi came into existence it's only gotten more wild.

  
I'd have to say at least the first part of what would be considered a fun meme coin project would have been DOGE at least one that really took off and became one of the most adopted token. This was back in 2014, and before that I would say most projects where legitimate cases of blockchain such as litecoin.

From there things fell rather quite for a while until 2017 when Ethereum layer two tokens really took off. This layer two token system opened up a lot of possibilities but it also opened up a lot of failed projects and yes scam investments.

From there we then moved into 2020-2021 with the introduction of Meme coins, DeFi and NFT a rather large growth in terms of amount of projects and people getting involved.

 Now we are in 2024-2025 bull run and we have a lot of the same crazy going on but at a whole new level. We have meme coin crazy, scams, rug pulls, DeFi hacks, Layer two token projects, NFTs, web3, gaming and more. It's gotten so big now that not everything goes up.

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,What’s the name of this Diffie‑Hellman problem variant ?,2024-12-15 17:01:16,"There’s several Diffie‑Hellman problems names like weak decisional Diffie Hellman problem or strong Diffie‑Hellman problem.

My case is the following : given finite field’s elements g ; d whose discrete logarithm is unknown, the attacker needs to compute integers a ; b and a' ; b' such as *g^(a)×d^b = g^(a\')×d^(b\')* where a≠a'.

What’s the name of this Diffie Hellman assumption variant ? Is it proven to be as hard as the discrete logarithm problem in the case of the elliptic’s curve variant ?",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680
Reddit,crypto,I was explained how to know if a given qth root can be used for elliptic curve pairing inversion. But what he did mean ?,2024-12-13 16:29:27,"There are many research papers that propose to lower the problem of fixed pairing inversion to exponentiation inversion. I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

I know what’s an elliptic curve billinear pairing. I know what’s the order and the embedding degree of an elliptic curve, but I understood nothing else from his answer.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680
Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

EDIT: seeing as all answers proposed seem to be missing the point it seems my post was very unclear. I invite anyone not to waste their time on this post anymore and if I find a better way to present what I'm talking about I'll create a new one.",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680

Reddit,crypto,Is there anything that would prevent peforming Weil Descent on binary curves of large characteristics ?,2024-12-08 08:47:27,"The ghs attack involve creating an hyperlliptic curve cover for a given binary curve. The reason the attack fails most of the time is the resulting genus grows exponentially relative to the curve’s degree.

We don’t hear about the attack on finite fields of large characteristics since such curves are already secure by being prime. **However, I notice a few protocol relies on the discrete logarithm security on curves with 400/500 bits modulus resulting from extension fields of characteristics that are 200/245bits long**.

Since the degree is most of the time equal to 3 or 2, is there anything that would prevent creating suitable hyperelliptic cover for such curves in practice ?",2025-02-12 12:19:20.130680
