Once again, the token is making waves as it rebounds from the key $2.8 support level, reigniting bullish optimism in the market. This level has proven to be a crucial battleground, with buyers stepping in to defend it multiple times.  Now, with renewed momentum, traders are watching closely to see if SUI can finally break through key resistance levels and turn this comeback into a sustained rally. The price action suggests growing confidence among bulls, but challenges remain as sellers continue to put pressure at higher levels.  A decisive move above resistance could open the door for a stronger push upward, potentially setting the stage for a fresh bullish trend. On the other hand, failure to maintain this strength might lead to another pullback, keeping SUI trapped in its consolidation phase. Bullish Momentum Builds, Will Buyers Finally Take Control? SUI is showing signs of renewed bullish momentum as buyers step in to defend the crucial $2.8 support level. After multiple attempts to push higher, the price action suggests that positive sentiment is gradually strengthening. Furthermore, this growing strength could catalyze a break through key resistance levels and establish a more sustained uptrend. Related Reading: SUI Rally Eyes Double-Digits: VanEck Analyst Forecasts $16 Price By Year-End Technical indicators are beginning to reflect this shift in sentiment. Currently, the price is climbing toward the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), signaling increasing buying interest, while the MACD hints at a possible bullish crossover. If buyers sustain this momentum, SUI may break above crucial resistance and trigger a stronger move toward higher price levels. Despite this positive setup, the battle isn’t over yet. Bulls must maintain control and push through key resistance barriers to confirm a trend reversal. If successful, SUI would establish a more stable uptrend, attracting further interest and paving the way for a breakout. Key Levels To Watch As SUI Eyes A Breakthrough As SUI continues to gain upward pressure and eyes a potential breakout, several price levels become crucial in determining its next move. Understanding these key levels can help investors navigate the market and make informed decisions. Related Reading: SUI Strong Resilience Play: Price Push Past $3.9 Resistance On the upside, the $3.5 resistance level is the first key barrier to overcome. A break above this level can fuel a stronger rally, bringing the next major resistance at $3.9. Should bulls manage to push past these hurdles, SUI could target $4.9 and $5.3, signaling a major shift in market sentiment. Meanwhile, traders are also watching momentum indicators like the RSI and MACD, which are showing signs of improvement. A bullish breakout would require strong volume and sustained buying pressure to confirm a trend shift. As SUI eyes a possible breakout, the next few trading sessions will be critical in confirming bulls’ full control of the market.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Wall Street’s Ethereum Short Bets Explode – Should Investors Worry?,2025-02-10 08:45:49+00:00,"In a dramatic shift, hedge funds appear to be ramping up short positions in Ethereum at a rate not seen before, sparking questions on whether the second‐largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be facing troubled waters—or if something else is at play. According to renowned analysts from the Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter), short positioning in Ethereum “is now up +40% in ONE WEEK and +500% since November 2024.” Their findings, shared on X, argue that “never in history have Wall Street hedge funds been so short of Ethereum, and it’s not even close,” prompting the question: “What do hedge funds know is coming?” Massive Ethereum Short Squeeze Coming? The Kobeissi Letter’s thread highlights an extreme divergence between Ethereum’s price action and futures positioning among hedge funds. They point to an especially volatile period on February 2, when Ethereum plunged by 37% in just 60 hours as trade war headlines emerged, wiping out more than a trillion dollars from the crypto market “in HOURS.” Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Below $2,800 Resistance – Bulls Need A Higher Low To Recover The analysts note how ETH inflows were robust during December 2024—even as hedge funds were reportedly boosting short exposure. According to the Kobeissi Letter: “In just 3 weeks, ETH saw +$2 billion of new funds with a record breaking weekly inflow of +$854 million. However, hedge funds are betting ETH’s surge and limiting breakouts.” They also underscore spikes in Ethereum trading volume, particularly on January 21 (Inauguration Day) and around the February 3 crash. Despite the historically high inflows, Ethereum’s price has “failed to recover the gap lower even as one week has passed,” and currently trades “~45% below its record high set in November 2021.” One of the biggest unknowns remains why hedge funds are so dedicated to shorting ETH. The analysts write: “Potential reasons range from market manipulation, to harmless crypto hedges, to bearish outlook on Ethereum itself. However, this is rather strange as the Trump Administration and new regulators have favored ETH. Largely due to this extreme positioning, Ethereum has significantly underperformed Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Ethereum Trades Inside A Multi-Year Bullish Pennant – Analyst Sees A Breakout Above $4K The Kobeissi Letter concludes its thread by drawing attention to Bitcoin’s outperformance and poses the question of whether a short squeeze could be in the making: Could Ethereum be setting up for a short squeeze? This extreme positioning means big swings like the one on February 3rd will be more common. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin is up ~12 TIMES as much as Ethereum. Is a short squeeze set to close this gap?” Glassnode’s CryptoVizArt Fires Back Not everyone in the crypto analytics sphere is convinced that the tidal wave of Ethereum short positions signals a bearish outlook. Senior researcher at Glassnode, CryptoVizArt.₿ (@CryptoVizArt), took to X to challenge the alarmist takes circulating on social media: “Barchart is screaming, ‘Largest ETH short in history!’ and crypto Twitter is running around like headless chickens. Seriously, if you fell for this clickbait headline, it’s time to up your game. Let’s set the record straight.” In a detailed thread, CryptoVizArt points out that the widely shared chart on hedge fund short positions likely represents only one subset of the market (e.g., “Leveraged Funds / Hedge Funds/CTAs”) and does not account for other significant market participants such as asset managers, non‐reportable traders, and on‐chain holders. They add that similar “massive shorts” were seen in Bitcoin futures as well, yet BTC outperformed ETH during the same period. Furthermore, CryptoVizArt emphasizes that CME Ether futures are just one sliver of global crypto derivatives. Liquidity on platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, as well as on‐chain positions and spot markets, offer a broader view than any one exchange’s data might suggest. “One group’s net short ≠ the entire market is net short. Hedge positions ≠ purely bearish bets.” Their final note: much of the positioning could be part of “non‐directional strategies—such as cash‐and‐carry,” which are neutral strategies used to lock in arbitrage gains and are not simply a direct bet against ETH. At press time, ETH traded at $2,629. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

A Quadrillion Market Cap For The Coin If That Happens – Analyst",2025-02-10 06:00:10+00:00,"In the realm of cryptocurrencies, a perplexing forecast has surfaced whereby an aspirational price objective of $10,000 for XRP is generating waves on trading platforms and social media. With the current price at $2.38, both experienced traders and newbies should find this prognosis very striking. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst Do The Figures Add Up? Let’s get right to the point: this forecast by crypto expert Gen A runs over a basic mathematical obstacle. XRP’s market capitalization would explode to an amazing $1 quadrillion at $10,000 per coin. This is nine times more than the entire global stock market, which by the end of 2023 was valued at $111 trillion. When one considers the nearly $2 trillion market cap of Bitcoin, the absolute absurdity of this situation becomes even clearer. Can XRP Reach $10,000? The Ultimate Breakdown of a Crypto Dream 🔸Why Do Some Believe XRP Can Hit $10,000? 🔸What Would It Take for XRP to Reach $10,000? 🔸What Are the Experts Saying? 🔸Final Verdict: Can XRP Hit $10,000? pic.twitter.com/Fftmqgdbx7 — gen A 🔶 (@genAbilsav) February 7, 2025 The Reasoning For International Payments With supporters citing SWIFT’s daily transaction volume of $5 trillion as evidence for the great valuation, the optimistic projection by Gen A mostly relies on XRP’s part in international money transfers. But this kind of mindset shows a critical misreading of market dynamics. The value of transactions conducted over a network has little bearing on the necessary market capitalization of its native coin. It’s like arguing a delivery truck should be valued as much as every box it carries. What Might Really Motivate XRP’s Development? XRP does have real growth triggers worth thinking about, even with the fanciful $10,000 per unit price projection. While the platform’s capabilities for real-world asset tokenization offers actual possibilities, the much-anticipated conclusion of Ripple’s litigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission could open institutional adoption. With each transaction, the built-in burn mechanism of the token destroys tiny quantities of XRP, therefore producing natural scarcity over time. Moreover, sources indicate the US government is assessing XRP for inclusion into a potential digital asset reserve. An Earthly Viewpoint Though fantasies of turning $1,000 into $4.2 million via a 420,068% price increase grab attention, they eventually take focus away from XRP’s actual potential. The potential of the cryptocurrency to act as a bridge currency and enable speedier, less expensive cross-border transactions defines its actual value proposition. Why Do Some Believe XRP Can Hit $10,000? The belief in a $10,000 XRP is largely based on its utility in global finance. Unlike speculative coins, XRP is designed to solve real-world problems, especially in cross-border payments.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Solana Faces Key Test – What Happens Next Could Be Game-Changing,2025-02-09 22:00:31+00:00,"Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a crucial moment for the price action of Solana, pointing to a key support level within a parallel channel. His technical analysis, which is based on SOL price action on the daily candlestick timeframe, shows that the altcoin has been trading in an uptrend channel since July 2024. Notably, this uptrend channel has been highlighted by the formation of higher lows and higher highs as Solana continued to push to new all-time highs. This bullish momentum has also driven increased interest in Solana casinos, where users can leverage fast transactions and low fees. Now, Martinez noted that holding above a key support level could reinforce the altcoin’s uptrend towards the upper trendline of the support channel. Related Reading: Bold Prediction: XRP Holders On The Path To Millionaire Status—Analyst Analyst’s Technical Outlook: A Make-Or-Break Support Level At the time of Martinez’s analysis, Solana was trading at $193, following a barrage of declines throughout last week. Notably, this decline saw Solana hit the bottom trendline of this uptrend channel. As such, the analyst noted that SOL’s action from here could determine its next big move.  If Solana manages to hold above this support level, the uptrend could regain strength, and the channel will still be in play. In this case, Solana will still be on track to push toward the upper end of the channel, which puts the price target around $387. On the other hand, if the support fails, a deeper correction could be on the table. Image From X: Ali_charts Solana Price Action: A Rollercoaster Ride To $293 And Back SOL is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the current crypto cycle, with its price recently skyrocketing to a new all-time high of $293 on January 19. The rally was primarily driven by a wave of interest following the launch of the Official Trump meme coin on the Solana blockchain, adding momentum to an already bullish trend for the altcoin. However, the euphoria has since cooled off, with Solana experiencing a 30% decline since the all-time high.  Since the time of the analysis, Solana has managed to rebound slightly from the lower boundary of its uptrend channel. Solana is currently trading at $204, meaning it has increased by about 5.7% since Martinez highlighted the key support zone. This reversal suggests that the uptrend channel is still in play, and Solana could continue to push upwards until it reaches $389. Interestingly, this price target at the upper end of the channel is reinforced by the Fibonacci extension indicator. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst This indicator is extended from the Solana low of $109 in August 2024, and the $389 price target is at the 1.272 extension level. The significance of this extension is reinforced by the fact that Solana’s January peak also coincided with the 1.0 Fibonacci level. Despite this recovery, the bullish momentum has yet to fully confirm itself with a strong breakout.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,XRP Bull Targets $2.80 Breakout — Key Levels To Consider,2025-02-09 20:30:23+00:00,"According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP recorded a substantial price decline in the past trading week losing 16.78% of its market value. Currently, the prominent altcoin finds itself in a consolidation zone potentially gathering momentum for its next breakout. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1, XRP To $6, And Solana To $1,000? Pundit Says You’re Not Bullish Enough XRP Price At Crucial Juncture In a recent X post, popular digital asset expert Egrag Crypto shared a technical analysis of the XRP market presenting both possible bullish and bearish scenarios. This analysis was based on Fibonacci retracement levels which identifies potential support and resistance levels and the 21-day exponential moving average which smoothens out price data giving more weight to recent prices. According to Egrag Crypto, XRP is expected to range between $2.27 (Fib 0.382) and $2.45 ( Fib 0.5). However, there is potential for prices to swing within a wider boundary of $2.06 (Fib 0.236) – $2.65 (0.618). Notably, the altcoin gained by 1.67% in the past day. However, a daily price close above the 21 EMA which is currently at $2.70 is crucial in confirming any uptrend.  Interestingly, if market bulls are able to force a strong close above $2.80 (Fib 0.702), this would suggest a major bullish signal indicating the current XRP buying pressure is sufficient to break higher resistance levels. On the other hand, Egrag Crypto warns that traders must avoid any price fall to $1.77 which may not necessarily invalidate the current bullish structure but would suggest rising bearish pressure.

However, the asset’s trading volume is down by 56.85% indicating a lack of interest and uncertainty in the market. However, considering XRP’s overall bearish form in the last seven days, a fall in trading volume may also suggest reduced selling pressure pointing to a potential reversal. Generally, XRP investors remain bullish on the asset’s prospects driven by several factors but most notably by the potential of an XRP Spot ETF. In the past week, there were significant developments on that front as the Chicago Board Options Exchange filed 19b-4 applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking to list and trade the XRP spot ETFs proposed by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21 Shares, and Canary. Once the SEC acknowledges receipt of these applications, the US regulator is granted a 45-day window – with potential extensions of up to 240 days – to assess and make an approval decision on the proposed ETFs.  Featured image from Trackinsight, chart from Tradingview",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Dogecoin Hits Weekly Support Trendline, Analyst Signals Cycle Bottom Is In",2025-02-09 19:00:53+00:00,"Recent price decline action has seen Dogecoin rebounding at a recent multi-month low after the entire market started last week on a liquidation stretch. However, technical analysis from analyst Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin may have already established its cycle bottom before the next price surge. Dogecoin Tests Key Weekly Support After 40% Drop The cryptocurrency market faced a significant downturn last week, with widespread losses hitting various digital assets. Dogecoin was no exception to the sell-off, experiencing a sharp decline of nearly 40% before finding support around $0.22. This drop marked the lowest price Dogecoin has reached since the beginning of 2025, and the last time it traded at this level was in early November 2024.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Set For A 10-Fold Explosion? Analysts Predict 6,000% Surge Despite the severity of the drop, technical analysis from crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin’s recent 2025 low may be more significant than it appears at first glance. In a social media post on platform X, the analyst shared a weekly timeframe chart highlighting that $0.22 is part of a key trendline that played a crucial role in Dogecoin’s price movements throughout 2024. Now, with the price falling back to this level and bouncing off it, Trader Tardigrade noted that the trendline has seemingly flipped into a strong support zone. As of now, Dogecoin has rebounded to $0.2561, reflecting a positive reaction of approximately 16% from its recent low. Notably, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows buyers stepped in just around this support level. However, Dogecoin’s ability to hold above this support level in the coming weeks will determine if the cryptocurrency has truly reached a bottom for the rest of this cycle.  Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Historical Pullbacks Point To $2 Price Target In another analysis, Trader Tardigrade highlighted a recurring pattern in which the Dogecoin price tends to experience significant pullbacks of more than 50% after a strong multi-month rally. However, these pullbacks have always been accompanied by another strong rebound rally, and Dogecoin eventually reached a new peak. His analysis noted three major pullbacks: the first saw a decline of 59.76%, the second dropped by 56.2%, and the most recent pullback registered a 58.25% drop. Based on this historical behavior, Tardigrade noted that the recent correction might be accompanied by another strong rebound.  The last such a rebound happened, Dogecoin went on a 23,000% increase to reach its current all-time high of $0.73. From here, Trader Tardigrade predicted a similar playout to reach a price target of $2. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst The $2 price target has been a recurring prediction among crypto analysts for Dogecoin. One similar prediction came from crypto analyst Dima Potts, who predicted that Dogecoin is poised to target all-time highs between $1.50 and $2.10. For now, the first step for a bullish Dogecoin would be to break above $0.3. Featured image from Mudrex, chart from TradingView",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Spot ETFs Outshine Bitcoin Counterparts With Double Market Inflows – Details,2025-02-09 17:30:09+00:00,"The Ethereum Spot ETFs began February 2025 on a strong positive note, recording net inflows double the size in the Bitcoin ETF market in the first week of the month. Interestingly, this development coincided with a bearish trading week for Ethereum, during which its price declined by 16.18%. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs Suffer $186 Million Outflows As New Year Struggles Persist – Details Ethereum Spot ETFs Register $420 Million Inflows Amid Price Fall As prices of Ethereum struggled to find market stability in the past week, the Ethereum Spot ETFs experienced an increased level of market interest translating into a net inflow of $420 million. Data from SoSoValue show the ETH ETFs pulled inflows significantly larger than the $203 million registered by the Bitcoin Spot ETFs despite the premier cryptocurrency having a better price performance.  Commenting on this eye-catching development, Coinbase analysts have attributed Ethereum ETF performance to a spiked interest in ETH as a preferred asset for CME basis trade over Bitcoin.   For context, the CME basis trade is a common trading strategy where market participants go long on an asset in the spot market and short in the future market with intentions to profit from the difference in market prices. According to data from Coinbase, CME ETH basis trade produced a higher gain (16%) than that of Bitcoin (10%) over the last week translating into an increased market institutional interest in the Spot ETFs.  Of the reported net inflows in the Ethereum ETF market, BlackRock’s ETHA remains investors’ favorite with total net deposits of $286.81 million. Unsurprisingly, Fidelity’s FETH came second with aggregate investments of $97.28 million. Grayscale’s ETHE, ETH, Bitwise’s ETHW, and 21 Shares’ CETH also recorded modest net inflows between $4 million -$18 million. Meanwhile, Invesco’s QETH, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, and VanEck’s ETHV all record zero net flows. Over the last trading week, the Ethereum Spot ETFs saw their net assets decline to $9.88 billion despite a net positive flow. At the time of writing, these ETFs now control 3.17% of the ETH market cap. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Be Primed For Another 100% Move After Printing Capitulation Candle ETH Price Overview  At press time, Ethereum trades at $2,681 following a 1.46% rise in the last 24 hours. However, daily trading volume is down by 45.15% and is now valued at $16 billion. According to its daily trading chart, the Ethereum Relative Strength Index is currently at 34.03 heading in an upward direction. This data suggests strong potential for a price reversal following last week’s price crash. In driving any price rally, market bulls will encounter strong resistance in the $3400 price zone, pushing past which could allow a return to the local market peak of $4,000.

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Reddit,solana,"How is literally 99/100 coins, especially those on the latest list of DEX aggregators with >200k liquidity, almost always rugs?",2025-02-09 19:50:48,"I’ve been in this space for a while now, and I’m honestly just feeling so done. Every time I see a coin on the 'newest' list of DEX aggregators, especially those with over 500k liquidity and a volume of more than a million, I get this glimmer of hope like “Hey, maybe this is the one.” But no, it’s always the same damn story.

Somewhere between the first pump and the second dip, everything collapses. I can’t even tell you how many coins I’ve lost on that looked so promising at first, with huge liquidity, high volume, buying pressure, even distribution and low whales, and all the right hype. Yet somehow, they still find a way to rug. The liquidity disappears, the price crashes so fast you can’t even get out in time, and suddenly, you’re left holding nothing.

I’ve seen people talk about how “this coin is different”, but deep down, I know. I KNOW it’s going to rug, just like every other one. The cycle feels endless, and I’m honestly just tired of losing. I can’t even trust the DEX lists anymore. 

Every time I try to find something decent, it just turns into another scam. I just don’t get it—99/100 times, how are scams SO common now? Is there any real hope of finding a gem, or are we all just destined to keep getting wrecked by these scams?

Sorry if I'm too dramatic, but this was the 4th time I got rugged today. I lost 34% of my balance in just one day.

Been seeing a lot of people talk about trading bots and wondering if they actually help or if manual trading is still the better move. Do bots really give an edge or is it all just about having a good strategy? I found the [Banana Gun bot](https://bananagun.io/) and would like to try it.

Reddit,solana,"As the Cheetah commences to chase after the Gazelle, does it think, ""I hope I'll catch it, otherwise I'll be hungry for 3 days""!?",2025-02-10 11:51:48,"The quickest mammal on Earth, the Cheetah,  can reach a speed of 100km/h in under 3 seconds. A McLaren 765LT with a price tag of over a half a million USD, does it in 2.8 seconds.

When the Cheetah reaches its peak acceleration, it can only run for a few seconds more by which time, it will have expended so much energy, that it takes the poor cat over 3-days of total rest to recover from the dash. 

If it doesn't catch the Gazelle it set about to hunt, the torment of those three, or more, days will be coupled with the excruciating pain of hunger.

Yet, the Cheetah will keep going at it until a Gazelle falls victim to its speed and agility. Therefore, I don't think the thought ever occurs to the Cheetah if it will, or will not feast on the Gazelle - it simply hunts without regard for hunger, failure, or success.

I see hundreds of posters on various crypto communities commenting, and seeking advice, in a mad panic, about whether to sell their coin(s) or not because they're anxious about the ""crash"" of one coin or another, or the whole crypto market, and whatever else that bugs them. 

Maybe, said good folks, should consider if they're suited for the ""hunt"" or not!?

In other words, if you're not prepared to ache in every part of your exhausted body, and potentially go hungry for 3 or more days, maybe you should consider not hunting Gazelles!!

Why get into a boxing match with Mike Tyson if you're not prepared for the pain?

And if you decided to get in the ring for a round with Mike, why ask the crowd how or when to get out? 

Moral of the stories, why gamble in the crypto market which is known for frequent tidal waves of volatility, when you don't have the stomach for it!?

What are your thoughts on this please!?",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

The tx sent was identical for both and just contained a simple buy request to the pumpfun program on an inactive token. The time taken includes the time taken to receive the tx confirmation using the signatureSubscribe rpc method. Helius won here by ~148k nanoseconds which equates to .148 seconds. Chainstack also gave me a rate limit error for trying to query the token balance afterwards, so it seems their rate limits are more restrictive here.

Reddit,solana,Telegrams are the ultimate meme coin killer - change my mind,2025-02-10 05:59:38,"There is NOTHING more bearish than an unregulated TG chat. NOTHING. Now hear me out before you shred me. My ultimate opinion is that TG's should be made still, and the main reason for that is to prevent these scammers in [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) threads (for those who actually use the chaotic platform to find new memes instead of some sort of pump vision platform like BullX) from convincing people to go into their stupid scam TG channels with the scam re-verify bots. Otherwise, I'd say scrap the idea of TG altogether. However, that chat should always be muted, and communication regarding working for those bags should happen in an ongoing group VC if needed. Here is why:

1. FUD is a real problem for coins. As Alfred in The Dark Knight said, ""some men just want to see the world burn"". There seems to be a certain type of meme regard whose sole goal is to ruin other people's good time. They will say whatever they can in TG's to try to kill a coin. This is literally IN ABSENCE of looking for a lower priced entry. They literally just want to kill the coin. Those that are FUDding for entry are also scumbags. A muted TG chat eliminates that problem, while still being able to have the buybot spam going and the raid links. Anyone that has anything important to say can say it on VC, if it's important.
2. The V2 scammers and the fake Safeguard bot (that asks you to ""reverify"") are getting out of hand. Like 2 scammers a minute joining talking about ""DM me immediately"" and all that shit. And the scam safeguard bot keeps getting forwarded into channels. The consequences of this are huge, and not just for the gullible regard that gets scammed. If they manage to take control of any wallets or get people to send them all their tokens, they immediately destroy the token by dumping the token onto the chain and draining the liquidity. So anyone that is holding a significant enough amount to dent the liquidity pool that is stupid enough to get scammed can destroy the token.
3. Prevent the PVP that inevitably happens when someone isn't happy a chart isn't moving up fast enough, ultimately reversing the chart. I have no emotional attachment to any token, so if I join a TG and the vibe is shit, I'm dumping the token (or alternatively not buying). I know others do the same.

Overall, there's literally nothing accomplished by having a non-muted TG chat for any token. The literal best case scenario is no TG at all, to be honest, but the pumpfun scammers get handicapped when you link a TG to the token on launch. So the next best thing is a muted TG. And for the love of god please set your buy bots to a REASONABLE minimum buy.

I never been envious or jealous of someone who has more . The way i think if u got more im tryna be ur friend ; learn from u and use u as motivation .

Reddit,solana,Solana bots are printing money… but who’s actually making the profits?,2025-02-08 21:55:38,"Alright, I need to talk about this because it’s been driving me mad. If you’ve been in the Solana ecosystem for a while, you’ve probably seen those insane bot transactions flying across mempools sniping, MEV strategies, sandwiching, arbitrage. Feels like every day, there’s some fresh “bot made $X million in Y minutes” headline. But here’s the real question: who’s actually making this money? Because it sure as hell isn’t me.

I tried running my own bot a while back as thought I was about to print cash like everyone else. Spoiler: I got absolutely wrecked))) Between failed transactions, frontrunning, and just straight-up coding errors, I basically paid Solana validators for the privilege of losing money. Meanwhile, the big boys with deep pockets and optimized code are feasting. Even the simplest sniper bots need constant tweaking to stay ahead, and if you’re slow by even half a second, forget it) someone else already ate your lunch.

At this point, I’m convinced that unless you’re a dev with insane experience (or sitting on a pile of SOL to absorb failed trades), trying to DIY this stuff is just a donation to the network. Lately, I’ve been messing with Bananagun Bot as it just copies profitable traders automatically through Telegram, so at least I don’t feel like I’m getting dunked on by algo nerds 24/7. Not saying it’s magic, but it’s definitely better than my own attempts at playing bot wars, lol. 

What do you think of these ""bot"" trends? Has anyone here actually managed to build a consistently profitable bot from scratch, or is the real money just in copying the ones that already work?

NOVA bot recently released thier chrome plug in allowing nove to be used through the bullx neo platform.

Speed and fees are unrivaled. Paying nova fees and trading off bullx neo is amazing.

Right after this they were mass reported and at the same time sniperoo shills came out of the wood works. I'm assuming a lot of these shills from looking at thier reddit are just in it for refferal codes as the majority of them do not seem like successful traders and have no idea what they are really talking about.

I'm no genius. I make a living trading mostly worthless shit coins. My brain is probably fried from staring at dumb memes all day so maybe just maybe my thought process is out of wack here. But after the DWT fiasco and other bots who have rugged and shilled the same exact way sniperoo is doing with these refferals and spamming ads.

Really it comes down to why use an inferior bot. My back up bot is trojan or bonk after NOVA. Sniperoo literally isn't even on the list anymore. Wouldn't use it if all other bots crashed and I had no way to trade. Especially after thier horrible shilling marketing.

No I'm not a nova bot shill. My reddit is organic and I don't have refferal codes for any bots anywhere on my reddit or comments.

Can people recommend me good places/communities to learn better on how to use these trading bots and some of the safest bots to use that are not going to just withdraw all my money after a while lol.

Reddit,solana,Automated memecoin trading bot,2025-02-08 01:43:32,"I need your opinions if this a feasible idea, something similar to sol sniper bot but with a higher level of customization:

\- automatically scans dexscreener for new tokens on it

\- it checks the token using the solana sniffer API to determine the potential risk level

\- if the risk level is low, it buys the token

\- after a certain % of profit it sells the token

Problems i find with this:

\- speed - i probably need to spend a 1-2k extra for this bot to be among the fast ones when purchasing coins

\- i wanted to add a part where it checks the social buzz and mentions of the token to give me an idea it if is something community backed, but the twitter API could be a problem there as i want this token check to run every minute

Do you think its worth building this kind of bot to automate the trades, get the promising tokens early and sell them?",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

1. If I’m doing this moves on a ledger that hasn’t been associated with my social security or me at all… tax ramifications? How can they prove I did this?

2. Should I do this move again as we’re at 508 Sol’s per BTC as I type this… should I double down and do 25% of the BTC this time?

Reddit,solana,Best Platform To Launch On?,2025-02-08 05:37:16,"Hi All!

Currently I am seeing 3 options to launch a Solana token (outside of doing the whole kit and caboodle myself on something like createmytoken etc); and I'd love some feedback from those with exp on which platform is ""better"". \*I put better in quotes because I know none of these are perfect and launching Sol memes is pretty much a trip to vegas to play ""watch the snipers"" slots - so need for that type of commentary please lol\*

1. [Pump.Fun](http://pump.fun/) \- obviously cheap, fast, huge following, pays .5 sol ""IF"" you migrate. Main question here which I can't get a straight answer on is: do they pay the .5 sol if the ""Dev""/creator also makes an initial purchase at launch? Some say yes some say no. Biggest con imo - is its rep for being scam city (well deserved) and the likelihood that I'd get rugged by snipers off the bat lol. But - the community is huge and thats helpful for a newer token who hasnt established much of a following yet. Also, I'm just kind of leary of the lawsuits popping up.
2. Moonshot (via Dexscreener) - cheap, but does have deployment fee, comes with enhanced Dex listing ($295 savings), and if i were to select raydium - pays 2 sol ""IF"" token migrates. Question here is also the same as above; is the 2 sol paid if the creator makes the initial purchase or is it only if the creator does NOT make the initial purchase? Can't tell from the docs. Also, if the creator makes the initial purchase is this considered ""liquidity"" and locked/burned or is it treated as a normal transaction that can be traded as per usual? Obvious con; community is smaller, don't see many tokens migrating from Moonshot and I've ""heard"" most will climb to just above bonding then Dump - speculation seems to be its an inside job with Moonshot /Dex.
3. A newer one - I've found ""GoFundMemes"" - super new, Ui looks janky, but I like that you can raise as little or as much you want prior to migration. They also seem to have a version that allows you to create your own tokenomics and vesting schedules. But again it looks like it showed up like a week or so ago and I don't know anybody who has launched on it .... so there's that

Any feedback would be appreciated (given its on topic and not to tell me to not bother wasting my time launching a token on Solana lol)

Reddit,solana,"Why Liquid Staking is Better Than Staking on Centralized Exchanges (and Why You Should Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase)",2025-02-06 22:52:53,"Hey,  
I have been seeing a lot of questions about staking lately, especially around liquid staking vs. staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, or Bybit. I wanted to share my thoughts on why liquid staking is the better move and why you should avoid staking SOL on Binance (bSOL), Bybit, or even Coinbase.

**1. Liquid Staking Gives You Flexibility**  
When you stake SOL through liquid staking protocols (like Marinade, Lido, The Vault or Jito), you get a liquid staked token (e.g., mSOL, stSOL, or jitoSOL, vSOL) in return. This means you can still use your staked SOL in DeFi..lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity while earning staking rewards. It’s the best of both worlds: you’re securing the network and earning yield, but you’re not locked out of using your funds.

With centralized exchanges, your SOL is locked up. You can’t do anything with it until you unstake (which can take days). That’s a huge opportunity cost, especially in a fast-moving ecosystem like Solana where DeFi opportunities are everywhere.

**2. Decentralization Matters**  
Staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase means they control the validators. This centralizes power and goes against the whole ethos of crypto. Solana is all about decentralization, and by staking with independent validators (or through liquid staking protocols that delegate to them), you’re helping keep the network secure and decentralized.

**3. The Vault Supports Decentralization by Delegating to Community-Driven Validators**  
One thing I love about liquid staking protocols like The Vault is that they actively support decentralization. For example, The Vault delegates to validators that are actively involved in the Solana community. These validators aren’t just big players with massive stakes, they’re smaller, community-driven operators who contribute to the ecosystem. By staking through The Vault, you’re not just earning rewards; you’re helping grow a more decentralized and resilient network.

**4. Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase**  
This is where it gets sketchy. Binance’s bSOL and Bybit’s staked SOL are essentially IOU tokens. You’re not actually staking on the Solana network, you’re trusting Binance or Bybit to do it for you. This adds unnecessary counterparty risk. What happens if Binance or Bybit gets hacked, goes down, or decides to freeze withdrawals? You’re stuck.

Coinbase isn’t much better. I used to stake my SOL on Coinbase because it was “easy,” but I quickly realized I was getting a lower APY compared to liquid staking or even direct staking. Plus, Coinbase takes a (35%) cut of your rewards, so you’re leaving money on the table. And just like Binance and Bybit, you’re trusting a centralized entity with your funds. If Coinbase has issues (like they did during the SEC lawsuit), your staked SOL could be at risk.

**5. Better Yields with Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking protocols often offer competitive APYs, and you can boost your returns even further by using your liquid staked tokens in DeFi. For example, you can deposit vSOL or jitoSOL into a lending platform or LP pool and stack yields. Centralized exchanges can’t compete with that.  


I used to stake on Coinbase because it felt “safe” and familiar, but once I learned more about how staking works and the risks of centralized exchanges, I switched to liquid staking. Now I use The Vault, and it’s been a game-changer. Not only am I earning better yields, but I can also use my vSOL in DeFi to maximize my returns. Plus, knowing that my stake is supporting community-driven validators through The Vault makes me feel like I’m actually contributing to Solana’s growth. It’s a no-brainer once you understand the benefits.

What do you guys think? Anyone else make the switch from CEX staking to liquid staking? ",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

the market cap and liquidity correlates, unlike on dexscreen where i’ll be watching market cat stay still like a possum playing dead than i’ll
check the charts and its actually 2-4k higher than it says. because of this i’ve lost out on 3-4k profit on trades ( not my actual investments obviously but roughly 4k would have been my take away if my fucking phantom wallet didn’t fail transactions.)


anyways yeah, just wondering if anyone knows if fasol is reliable/trustworthy or if anyone here actually personally uses it.

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,ethereum,Which web/online wallet allows you to put name labels?,2025-02-07 01:00:03,"I have a need to personalize the ethereum address (via a screenshot) to make it clear to corporate purposes and the tax authority of my country of residence for accounting purposes. This is important to reflect the essence of the operation, for example, there was a movement of an ETH between an individual and his own legal entity, but not the sale of capital. 

In other words, I want to go through some service like Myetherwallet into my wallet and put my full name next to the address, as well as with the opportunity to show in the service itself a transaction originating in the past, and regarding it, so that the screen shows that the wallet belongs to me. Ideally, if you can save the recipient’s address under a different name and this is added as part of a specific operation (personal - corporate)

We are not talking about public coverage of the owner on the blockchain through signed transactions, without compromising the loss of anonymization of the owner!

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Reddit,ethereum,🚀 Major Update: Wanchain’s ETH XFlows Now Integrated with Polygon zkEVM! 🚀,2025-02-03 14:56:23,"https://preview.redd.it/mnxzuga2uxge1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=930d2fb712a78a211091fca9262c13d3acd8fdb9

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

So i’ve been in the crypto / bitcoin space since 2017. Most of my friends know i like and follow bitcoin. I don’t mind discussing it in personal circles and acquaintances. 

However, i recently bought a copy of ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ and started reading it but i am uncomfortable reading it with its cover on display on public transport. 

I find it weird that after all these years, and so much mainstream acceptance for bitcoin, i still find it awkward to display my affinity to bitcoin coin in public. I feel people will judge me - for something not sure what.

Beside a few MSTR shares - I don’t hold anything else than btc in cold storage. If I lose my money - I am truly in the worse space possible so what I saved so far are the money that I CANNOT afford to lose.
A company stock can crash, an house can burn, a business can fail, a good bar can be stolen… also bitcoin needs security - this is why I cold storage with passphrase - but I have the feeling that it will be the fastest horse in the race and the risk to hold bitcoin is lower than anything else.

As the years went on however the old bitcoin core wallet was completely deleted off the computer by one of the other family members. After all these years with the recent price of bitcoin I became a lot more interested on trying to recover the old wallet data. I decided to use a file recovery software(DMDE) and was able to recover a lot of .dat files from there. I then formatted the wallets and used py wallet with a bash script to recover both the secret phrase and an ENCRYPYTED key from the recovered wallet.day file. Here’s where I’ve became extremely stuck

I’ve been searching all over the internet trying to figure out how I can even attempt to unencrypt the file. I’ve tried using multiple python scripts to attempt the recovery but none were successful, am I doing something wrong here? 

I also have been struggling and wondering how I’ll even import a private key if I’m able to ever unencrypted the file itself.

I was wondering what are the best steps I should do from here with an overall in-depth answer. If possible that is.

Most of my assets I want to keep for at least a year. But I got a bit tired watching my Cryptos go up and down constantly - and I'm guessing smo is making profits out of this...  So I am thinking to take a small portion to try out Range-Trading.

E.g. in the current phase buy BTC at 97k Sell at 102k. When at some point theres a bigger push, find a new support & resistance level and continue the scheme.

Who has experience with this and what tips can you give?

# 2) Getting a Wallet

So far I've been holding on Kraken. If I'd start range trading there I'd first sell the coins I first bought = highest taxes. So I want to put all my assets in a wallet, that ideally allows me to choose the assets based on time I bought them for trading (LIFO).

a) Which wallet?

Looking for a safe, easy to use affordable wallet. Smo recoomend Ledger Nano X Does that make sense for my use case? Other suggestions and why?

b) Where to trade cheapest

Obviously for this to work, the fees and spreads have to be good. Kraken is ok - but maybe theres a better way?

c) Safety

Reddit,bitcoin,"My BTC buying ""feeless"" strategy",2025-02-09 18:45:25,"Let me start by saying that I’m a bit of a cheap-o, I don’t like spending money unnecessarily and am always on the lookout for ways to save, even if it’s just a penny here and there. With that in mind, here’s my strategy for buying Bitcoin without ""feeling"" it.

I have two [free] credit cards:

1. A card called Plata that gives me 1% cashback on every purchase.
2. Another card called Nu that comes with a savings account offering 12.5% annual interest on the balance.

Here’s how it works:
- Whenever I make a purchase, I use the Plata card to earn cashback.
- I then round up the purchase amount and transfer the rounded-up amount from my bank account to the Nu card. For example, if I buy something for $53, I might round up to $55 or $60 and transfer that whole amount to Nu, where it earns interest daily.

The reason for rounding up is twofold:
1. It helps me slowly build up the balance in Nu, even if I haven’t made many purchases that month. The higher the balance, the more interest I get.
2. It ensures I have enough in Nu to meet the minimum transfer requirement those months I really cheaped out and didn't use the card much. 

At the end of the month, when the Plata statement comes in (minus the cashback), I pay it off using the balance from Nu. Any leftover money in Nu is what I use to buy Bitcoin (which is essentially the cashback from Plata, plus my roundups, plus the interest earned in Nu).

The key is that I don’t have to make a separate transfer from my bank account specifically to buy Bitcoin, which makes it feel more seamless, and less painful psychologically. For a cheap-o like me, this is a way to stack sats without ""feeling it."" Thought I'd share it in case there are other cheap-o's like me out there.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

I’ve been reflecting on Bitcoin’s journey, from its early days as a radical experiment in decentralization to becoming a multi-trillion-dollar asset that mainstream finance can’t ignore. It’s wild how what started as a rebellion against centralized control is now part of the global financial conversation.

But here’s a thought: as Bitcoin matures and institutional players pile in, are we at risk of losing that original revolutionary spark?

•	⁠Technological Evolution: Innovations like the Lightning Network are game-changers, but how do they align with or challenge Bitcoin’s founding ethos?",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,bitcoin,The 7th Circle of Hell- Coinbase Account Locked Out After Yubikey Removed,2025-02-09 21:33:36,"We've had a Coinbase account setup for my daughter with Bitcoin in it.

Last month, this account had 2FA Text messaging for security. It always worked. 

But for extra security,  We added a Yubikey as a more secure option using the desktop version of Coinbase (CB).

We noticed that the Coinbase app  under Yubikey was not compatible with her iPhone SE for some buggy reason.

I suggested we login via the desktop version of Coinbase and remove the Yubikey. I thought this would allow the Coinbase app to work better.  It was a huge disaster due to poor coding in Co8nbase.

The Coinbase Help page specifically states you can change your 2FA options once you are logged into your account.  THIS IS FALSE. IT DOES NOT ALLOW THIS.

Instead, it seems we should have ADDED the Text 2FA option back in BEFORE removing the Yubikey.  Because we have now entered the Coinbase 7th Circle of Hell.

Immediately after deleting the Yubikey 2FA key as a 2FA option, my daughter's account switched to the next most secure method.  IT switched on its own to Google Authenticator.

CLEARLY, THIS IS A BUG.  IT DEFIES THEIR OWN HELP INSTRUCTIONS.  

As we have never had this account setup with Google Authenticator for 2aFA on my daughter's phone, we are now locked out of our account the second we sign out on our desktop.  

Any attempt to add an alternate 2FA method, such as reverting back to Text SMS messages leads to a dialog box requesting a 6 Digit Authenticator code.  A code we cant generate since we never used Authenticator on this account.

The other option: ""Try Another Way"" pops up the link to RECOVER Your Account, which is a nightmarish multi-day process at a minimum.  We have entered the Coinbase 7th Circle of Hell, metely by removing our Yubikey while inside our account at the 2FA Settings screen.  This makes no sense.

We once spent an entire week in this 7th Circle of Hell because my daughter's account was inactive for 9 months.

My blood pressure hit a new record high today.  We're pulling all the tex statements and CSV files off the account.  It's nearly tax time and we dont know how long this nightmare will last.

I am poating this to watn others not to make this mistake.

And really, there's a design flaw here.

Conferences used to accept Bitcoin for tickets, now they don’t. 

The entire point of Bitcoin was to replace fiat. It was a better version of cash. It took the power out of the central banks. We aren’t beating the central banks if we’re not using the best weapon to fight them.

How do we make Bitcoin a medium of exchange again? Will the industry ever become what it was meant to be, a replacement for fiat and credit cards? Will it take improvements to the network?

Reddit,bitcoin,What is your CODE RED process?,2025-02-09 12:48:16,"Hi all,

I see comments on here often regarding what people do incase their seedphrase gets compromised. For example, dummy wallets with small amounts, having 2 cold storages that you can jump between, passphrases etc. I just wanted to know the specifics of what your process would be if there was a code red and your seed phrase was compromised, or your device was stolen/lost.

(1) So for example, let's say you're storing your seedphrase not buried underground or in a secure safe, just in your house somewhere. You're on holiday and you get a message from your neighbour that your house has been burgled. What would you do? Do you keep wallet addresses on you at all times and quickly transfer everything out to another place? Like another wallet? Or even an exchange temporarily?

I'd just like to know exactly what you guys have in place incase something like that happened. I have a cold wallet so have a basic understand of how that all works. But if I suddenly found out my seedphrase was compromised, or my device was stolen, I wouldn't really know the quickest way to rectify that.

(2) Also, I've had a Ledger for a while. I bought it like 4 years ago and at the time didn't do my research properly. But I've swapped to a Trezor now. How would you utilise that Ledger wallet now? I've seen comments about using another/old wallet as the middle man, and keep the new Trezor as offline as possible. So say, Coinbase > Ledger > Trezor. Keep the transactions to and from exchanges off the Trezor, and as offline as possible.

So with that theory, you'd have the Trezor wallet address written down somewhere? Would it be safe to have on your phone notes? To be used in option (1) and also option (2).

Sorry a lot to unpack there. But just wanted to know what you guys reckon.

I'm just holding Bitcoin now. And have 2 wallets. Trezor Safe 3 (BTC only) and the original Ledger Nano X. So two wallets now, but seeing as I still have that working Ledger, just wondered what the best way would be to utilise the two (if at all).",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,bitcoin,Why capital gains tax is pure theft,2025-02-07 17:53:11,"Say you have $100,000 you want to protect from inflation. 

You buy an asset (Bitcoin, Gold, Real-estate).

In 5 years, your asset is worth $250,000.

You sell and must pay capital gains taxes on $150,000 (at 20% that would be $30,000 in tax).

But over those 5 years, the government printed 10% new money each year, which devalued your dollars by 37.9%.

That means they already taxed you on your wealth each year, so why are you also paying a ""capital gain"" on the sale?

So the calculation should be:

$250,000 - 37.9% depreciation - $100,000 initial investment

Your actual gain was only $93,150 after depreciation.

But you're being asked to pay 20% on the total $150,000 instead of on the actual inflation adjusted gains.

And even worse, the inflation numbers they publish are fake to make them seem better than reality actually is, so you can't even calculate an accurate depreciation over time (more accurate to use real estate prices to see depreciation rate).

So why the fuck do we allow them to charge us capital gains tax, when we are ALREADY TAXED EVERY YEAR by the MONEY PRINTING??

Complete bullshit.

Reddit,bitcoin,Is Passive Bitcoin Mining with Ember Worth It?,2025-02-09 20:11:09,"💡 **Has anyone here tried mining Bitcoin without hardware?** I recently came across an app that lets you collect satoshis daily with almost no effort. You just open the app **once a day**, tap a button, and it farms satoshis **every hour**.

📱 **How does it work?**

* No hardware or investment needed
* Runs in the background without battery drain
* Passive BTC accumulation over time

🎯 **What’s the catch?**  
Of course, it’s not actual mining like running an ASIC, and the rewards are small. But I’m curious – **has anyone else tested similar apps?** Are they worth it long-term?

Reddit,bitcoin,Does AGI threaten Bitcoin and the entire monetary system?,2025-02-09 18:00:11,"I want to start by saying that I truly believe Bitcoin is the ultimate form of money. In our current monetary system, I think it will eventually surpass every other asset class.

Over the past five years, I’ve spent a considerable amount of time thinking through all the possible scenarios in which Bitcoin could hypothetically fail or stop growing. In my opinion, there is only one real threat in the near future—not just to Bitcoin but to our entire monetary system—and that is the potential creation of artificial general intelligence.

If a cheap enough AGI would be created, that would mean that a possible super intelligence would follow soon after.

The emergence of such super intelligence would mean that all human labor would become basically worthless. And I don't even want to get into the obvious alignment problem.

I know it is not set in stone that this will be possible in our near future, because the current LLM based systems make a lot of mistakes in the form of hallucinating facts. However, I believe the potential is significant enough that we should at least be cautious.

What do you guys think of this possibility? I know its a bit of a who the fuck knows, but I’ve noticed that this uncertainty has made me more reluctant to save money in Bitcoin. Instead, I find myself spending it on things I enjoy, simply because the future feels so unpredictable. :)

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Can customers actually do XRP-based money transfers through conventional banks?,2025-02-10 01:12:05,"I'm from a very a country with a very archaic and anti-competitive banking system. From what I've read, at least one chain of major national banks has some affiliation to XRP, but I haven't seen anything about how to do faster and less expensive money transfers via XRP from that bank. XRP isn't mentioned anywhere on its website, and that got me wondering how banks even refer to XRP-based money transfers - to the extent that they acknowledge XRP or crypto to their customers at all.

Do any banks where you live actually let you transfer fiat money via XRP? If so, do they refer to such transactions as ""wire transfers,"" ""XRP money transfers,"" or something different? Also, wouldn't both the sending bank AND the receiving bank need to support XRP for this sort of transfer to go through?",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Polygon & the Super Bowl: From Reddit Avatars to Polymarket’s $14M Bet,2025-02-10 06:56:27,"Today I crossed with this interesting [Tweet ](https://x.com/p_petertherock/status/1888697925423055196)sharing data regarding the NFL Super Bowl on Polygon.

As you may know, two years ago Reddit had a Reddit Collectible Avatars marketing campaign for the NFL Super Bowl LVII and they gifted event related avatars to the users that claimed them. Like this one:

https://preview.redd.it/otzpr7cxe9ie1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c11a4bcb1012357f0045a9d85d05fa4b335dfe3

This whole event minted 2,124,854M Collectible avatars on Polygon Network. Unfortunately Reddit next year's Superbowl tried something similar but making them too expensive and not achieving that great success.

https://preview.redd.it/c8bpje8ye9ie1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cab97c93ac7dbe580b8c5584b3c01b2ac694c6c

This year unfortunately Reddit didn't organized any kind of Superbowl Reddit Collectible avatars related event but this time we have another protagonist, Polymarket.

Polymarket is making Polygon once again the center of the action in this Super Bowl LIX with $14 million in active positions across 478 Super Bowl related markets.

https://preview.redd.it/8f4j0vcze9ie1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d8ea4f64ae9bf83243e247b50eab8bb720ee9d0

Polymarket is having +$414M in betting volume as you can see in the image below.

https://preview.redd.it/0ezm6db0f9ie1.png?width=2866&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ed80ca307de721aead71c5cc9a0fadedeb4a61

Polygon continues to cement its presence at the NFL Super Bowl, and this time, it’s through **Polymarket**, the popular decentralized prediction market.

https://preview.redd.it/ufc4f8yoa9ie1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac766257a4ac5282666da10bacf6056bb6815594

Polymarket is really gamblers paradise xD

With all of this I just want to show that Polygon has probably one of the most used real use of cases even if it is a casino and its bringing a lot of money and people to Polygon ecosystem building a unstoppable ecosystem that pushes adoption in crypto. And this is just the beginning because one AggLayer starts being operative it will be easier than ever to move money between layers to participate on fun dApps like Polymarket. Polygon is about to wake up.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Tether CEO ""All people alive ... will move to new QUANTUM-RESISTANT addresses”",2025-02-09 16:49:37,"He's correct- the transition has to happen.    
  
But apparently he doesn't see an issue with 20-25% of supply (lost wallets) being taken by quantum computing.  

That's quite the rosy take on it.  I'd imagine smart money would exit ahead of this for 3 reasons.    
  
Potential panic as wallets ""wake up"" at an alarming rate.    
Potential panic at what the price impact could be.    
Potential panic of people worrying others will panic.

  
I actually think there is a much better approach - that I've written about before.    
  
I was told it was a bad idea.  My guess is people either didn't get it, or didn't like the idea that quantum computing requires solutions, starting now to properly be ready without disruption.

This certainly is not a narrative, it isn't FUD.    
  
The biggest players in the world recognize it- and that includes the CEO of Tether.

Let's stop trying to spin it, ignore it, or assume it will be managed.  The time to deal with it is now.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I have a question about microstrategy and executive order 6102,2025-02-10 10:55:12,"Hey,

I've been doing some research on the history of money and how money works and all that fun stuff, and I just had this question like a few minutes ago in my head that I want an answer for, but before my question I just want to link this from the wikipedia:

**""Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 (equivalent to $487 in 2023) per troy ounce.""**

What if, US government sees it as a threat that all money is flowing into bitcoin and notices, that all countries have been adapting bitcoin into their reserves and feels like they are falling behind? Can't they make another executive order for let's say Microstrategy, that either all their shares, or all their bitcoin has to be forfeited to the US government, either for free, or for some fee such as the current market price.

I understand that this is not an issue for bitcoiners with small holdings, especially the ones who have kept their mouths shut, but for businesses and larger corporations that have to report their BTC holdings, what prevents another executive order from forcing companies like MSTR to forfeit all the bitcoin to the US government?

I'm not the best at explaining and asking stuff, but I hope you guys understand where I'm going with this, like don't people like michael saylor or companies such as MSTR with bitcoin reserves have some risk involved in owning bitcoin, since they still have to answer and do as the government tells them to at the very end? I'm a firm believer of self-custody and I had this question for the people that own MSTR stock, like ""what if? not your keys not your coins, right?""

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I made an Open source tool to help you backtest your trading or investment strategy,2025-02-09 13:37:41,"Backtesting a strategy means applying it to a historical dataset and seeing how it would have performed on past data. The results should then determine if this is a potentially viable strategy to start live trading/investing with, or whether it needs some more fine-tuning.

The problem with backtesting strategies is that it usually requires you to pretty much re-write your backtesting algorithm because each strategy needs to be configured to act in a specific way. To get around this issue, I made a simple tool that allows you to easily create plug-and-play strategies and slot them into the Backtester.

The tool is written in Python and uses the Backtester py library to handle backtesting and reporting. Because it's modular it's very easy to code a strategy and test it. For instance, here's how you'd go about coding a Buy The Dip strategy:

    class BuyTheDip(Strategy):
        def init(self):
            pass
    
        def next(self):
            current_close = self.data.Close[-1]  # Current candle's close
            previous_close = self.data.Close[-2]  # Previous candle's close
            price_difference = (current_close - previous_close) / previous_close * 100
    
            if price_difference <= -5:
                self.buy(
                    size=0.1, sl=stop_loss * current_close, tp=take_profit * current_close
                )
                print(
                    f""Bought at {current_close}, which is a {price_difference}% from previous close ({previous_close})""
                )
            else:
                print(f""Did not buy, price difference is only {price_difference}%"")

Here, we want to buy Bitcoin every time the price drops by more than 5% compared to the previous candle close.  
Running the strategy will output its performance like so:

https://preview.redd.it/itzhrks3o3ie1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=191567e62b2d5271c929805c05141aed28e944e6

Buy and Hold Return%, Return %, Win Rate and Profit Factor are metrics you need to look out for. 

* Buy and Hold return tells us whether it's more advantageous to simply buy and hold rather than trade over that specific period
* Return % is the amount of profit made trading
* Win Rate is a percentage showing how many of our trades are profitable. As you can see buying dips and selling them at a 5% take profit gives us a 90% profitability rate.
* Profit Factor represents the gross profit divided by the gross loss

The backtester will also plot the performance, showing you the entry and exit positions on a candlestick chart.

https://preview.redd.it/hjvf15c1o3ie1.png?width=3771&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff61f16011326f21560cb4bcc4e59f4e89d5aed1

In my example, I used CoinGecko API to fetch historical data, but you may use any data source you wish, as long as you feed it candlestick data.

Unfortunately, I have to go to x/twitter to get the latest dialogue for what is happening in blockchain.  This sector is infested with people (mostly men) who are some of the biggest fucking losers I have ever seen.

And yeah, I get it man, you got 7 figures in your phantom wallet.  You got a nice house, you got a big dick, you fuck beautiful women.  I get it guys, ""YOU WON"".  But you know what else?  You are the biggest losers I have ever seen.

This guide explains how to use various indicators for technical analysis (TA) in crypto trading, including:

	•	Bollinger Bands
	•	50-Day, 100-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages
	•	Moving Average EMA Cross (MA with EMA Cross)
	•	MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
	•	Stochastic RSI
	•	Pivot Points (Standard & Fibonacci Retracements)
	•	Triple EMA (TEMA)
	•	VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)

Each section details how the indicator works, how to interpret it, and how to use it in trading strategies.

1. Bollinger Bands

What It Is:

Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that consists of three lines:
	•	Middle Band: A 20-period simple moving average (SMA)
	•	Upper Band: Middle band + (2 × standard deviation)
	•	Lower Band: Middle band - (2 × standard deviation)

How to Interpret:

	•	Price touching the upper band → Overbought (potential sell signal)
	•	Price touching the lower band → Oversold (potential buy signal)
	•	Bands expanding → High volatility
	•	Bands contracting → Low volatility (potential breakout incoming)

Trading Strategy:

	•	Breakout Trading: Look for price to break above or below the bands after a period of contraction.
	•	Mean Reversion: If price moves far outside the bands, it may revert to the mean (middle band).

2. 50-Day, 100-Day, and 200-Day Moving Averages

What It Is:

Moving Averages (MAs) smooth price action over a set period to identify long-term trends. The most commonly used moving averages are:

	•	50-Day Moving Average (50 MA): Short- to mid-term trend indicator.
	•	100-Day Moving Average (100 MA): Medium-term trend indicator.
	•	200-Day Moving Average (200 MA): Long-term trend indicator.

How to Interpret:

	•	Price above the 50 MA → Short-term bullish trend
	•	Price above the 100 MA → Mid-term bullish trend
	•	Price above the 200 MA → Long-term bullish trend
	•	Price below these moving averages → Bearish trend signals

Trading Strategy:

	•	Buy when price bounces off the 50, 100, or 200 MA as support.
	•	Sell if price rejects these levels as resistance.

3. Moving Average EMA Cross (MA with EMA Cross)

What It Is:

The Moving Average EMA Cross (MA with EMA Cross) is a trend-following indicator that tracks the relationship between a simple moving average (SMA) and an exponential moving average (EMA).

	•	SMA (e.g., 50-day SMA): Smooths price over a fixed period.
	•	EMA (e.g., 21-day EMA): Gives more weight to recent price action.

How to Interpret:

	•	EMA crossing above the SMA → Bullish signal
	•	EMA crossing below the SMA → Bearish signal

Trading Strategy:

	•	Golden Cross: A short-term EMA (e.g., 21 EMA) crosses above a longer SMA (e.g., 50 SMA) → Strong bullish signal.
	•	Death Cross: A short-term EMA (e.g., 21 EMA) crosses below a longer SMA (e.g., 50 SMA) → Strong bearish signal.

4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

What It Is:

MACD consists of:

	•	MACD Line (12 EMA - 26 EMA)
	•	Signal Line (9 EMA of the MACD Line)
	•	Histogram (Difference between MACD and Signal Line)

How to Interpret:

	•	MACD Line crossing above the Signal Line → Bullish (buy)
	•	MACD Line crossing below the Signal Line → Bearish (sell)
	•	Histogram shrinking → Weakening trend
	•	Histogram expanding → Strengthening trend

Trading Strategy:

	•	Look for crossovers at key support/resistance levels.
	•	Divergence between MACD and price → A potential trend reversal.

5. Stochastic RSI

What It Is:

A momentum oscillator that compares the RSI of an asset to its past performance. It ranges from 0 to 100.

How to Interpret:

	•	Above 80: Overbought (potential reversal or pullback)
	•	Below 20: Oversold (potential buying opportunity)
	•	Crossovers:
	•	%K line crossing above %D line → Buy signal
	•	%K line crossing below %D line → Sell signal

Trading Strategy:

	•	Use with trend confirmation: Look for overbought/oversold signals in conjunction with price action and volume.

6. Pivot Points (Standard & Fibonacci Retracements)
What It Is:

Pivot Points help identify support and resistance levels based on the previous day's high, low, and close.

	•	Standard Pivot Formula:Pivot Point (P) = (High + Low + Close) / 3
	•	Resistance levels: R1, R2, R3
	•	Support levels: S1, S2, S3
	•	Fibonacci Retracements:
	•	Key levels: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%
	•	Price often retraces to these levels before continuing its trend.

How to Interpret:

	•	Price breaking above a pivot point → Bullish continuation
	•	Price breaking below a pivot point → Bearish continuation
	•	Fibonacci levels as pullback zones

Trading Strategy:

	•	Use pivot points to set entry/exit points.
	•	Combine Fibonacci retracements with support levels for high-probability trades.

7. Triple EMA (TEMA)

What It Is:

The Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) is a faster-moving version of an EMA that reduces lag.
How to Interpret:

	•	TEMA moving up → Strong bullish trend
	•	TEMA moving down → Strong bearish trend
	•	TEMA crossing below price action → Potential support
	•	TEMA crossing above price action → Potential resistance

Trading Strategy:

	•	Use TEMA for short-term trend confirmation.
	•	Use with MACD or RSI to avoid false signals.

8. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
What It Is:

VWAP is the average price of an asset weighted by volume over a given period, often used by institutions.

How to Interpret:

	•	Price above VWAP → Bullish (buyers in control)
	•	Price below VWAP → Bearish (sellers in control)
	•	VWAP acting as support/resistance → Strong level to watch

Trading Strategy:

	•	Intraday trading: Buy when price pulls back to VWAP in an uptrend.
	•	Confirm trends: If price stays above VWAP for most of the day, expect higher highs.

Example: Applying Technical Indicators to a Cryptocurrency

1. Bollinger Bands

	•	Setup: Apply a 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) with bands set at 2 standard deviations.
	•	Observation: The cryptocurrency's price touches the upper band after a period of low volatility (narrow bands).
	•	Interpretation: This may indicate an overbought condition and a potential increase in volatility.
	•	Action: Consider monitoring for a possible price reversal or pullback.

2. Moving Averages (50-day, 100-day, 200-day)

	•	Setup: Plot the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day SMAs.
	•	Observation: The price is above all three moving averages, with the 50-day SMA above the 100-day, and the 100-day above the 200-day.
	•	Interpretation: This alignment suggests a strong bullish trend.
	•	Action: Look for buying opportunities, anticipating the continuation of the uptrend.

3. Moving Average EMA Cross

	•	Setup: Use a 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA).
	•	Observation: The 21-day EMA crosses above the 50-day SMA.
	•	Interpretation: This ""Golden Cross"" indicates potential upward momentum.
	•	Action: Consider initiating a long position, expecting further price increases.

4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Explaining Bitcoin 12 Years Ago When It Was Worth Below $100—To an Empty Room,2025-02-07 19:00:56,,2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"The Fun Fact About Crypto: Holding Numbers, Owning Nothing",2025-02-10 08:34:54,"When you ask a crypto holder what they actually own in the amount shown in their wallet, they will likely say something like ""an asset"" or ""a store of value."" But that’s not true. The fact is, they own nothing. They hold a number but own nothing.

To see why, let’s first understand what it actually means to own an asset or a store of value.

Imagine you are holding 500 units of wheat. In this case, you don’t just hold a number; you own something real, an asset. Why? Because wheat has the potential to fulfill people’s nutritional needs. It can be consumed as food, which is essential for survival. That is value. The wheat itself stores this value within it. The number “500” is merely a way to express the amount of that stored potential. The bigger the number the bigger the potential. 

Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you hold 500 dollars. This, too, is an asset. Why? Because the dollar holds the potential to fulfill people's needs, the needs to pay debt. Namely, every dollar in existence comes into circulation as a loan, either through a commercial bank lending money to individuals or businesses or through a central bank purchasing government bonds. These obligations create a real, tangible need for dollars, just as the biological necessity of food creates a need for wheat.

Just as biology enforces the need for food, banks enforce the need for dollars through loan contracts and collateral, ensuring that debtors must obtain dollars to settle obligations they signed. In this way, dollars store value, just like wheat. The value of the dollar comes from its ability to meet people's needs. If you hold 500 dollars, you own a specific amount of this potential to fulfill people’s needs. Once again, the number “500” is simply an expression of the amount of that potential. The bigger the number the bigger the potential. 

The same principle applies to digital goods. If you own a collection of music files, e-books, or software, you own assets because these things hold the potential to entertain, inform, or assist with tasks like writing or data analysis. Their value comes from their ability to fulfill people's needs. The more units of these digital assets you own, the more needs you can fulfill.

Now, let’s compare this to crypto. When you hold a number in your wallet, do you own a specific amount of food, music, e-books, or software licenses? No. That number does not represent anything that fulfills people’s needs.

Is that number issued as a debt obligation like dollars? No. Does the crypto system store loan contracts, collaterals, or government bonds like the banking system? No.

Therefore, if you hold one crypto unit, your potential to fulfill people’s needs is zero. If someone else holds 1,000,000 crypto units, their potential is not a million times greater than yours - it is still zero. Both of you own zero potential to fulfill people's needs.

This means crypto is not an asset. It does not store value. It is simply a system that assigns numbers to addresses and records those assignments in a digital ledger.

Some argue that crypto’s value comes from scarcity, often pointing to Bitcoin’s 21 million cap. But scarcity applies to assets. If you limit the amount of wheat or dollars in circulation, their ability to fulfill people's needs remains. But in crypto, there is no asset to be scarce, just numbers on a ledger. Therefore, the 21 million cap is not scarcity; it is merely a mathematical rule limiting the sum of assigned numbers in the system.

One of the most praised features of crypto is its simplicity and speed. But why is it so fast and easy? Because it does not manage any assets. Managing assets is inherently complex.

Wheat requires warehouses, packaging, transportation, harvesting, quality control, and distribution networks to ensure its usability. Dollars require assessing creditworthiness, drafting loan contracts, securing collateral, regulating banks, and enforcing debt repayment. All of these processes exist because assets must be carefully managed.

But crypto has none of this. There is no collateral to manage, no contracts to enforce, and no tangible good or service behind it. All it does is track numbers. And tracking numbers is easy.

The fun fact about crypto is this: holders believe they own something, but in reality, they own nothing. They hold numbers but possess no assets, no store of value, and certainly no money or currency, since those are types of assets.

No matter how much crypto advocates argue about scarcity, decentralization, or belief-driven value, the fundamental fact remains: they hold numbers but own nothing. Crypto is merely a system that tracks numbers assigned to addresses, with no real-world connection to tangible needs or value. Strip away the collective belief, and what remains is just a digital record stating, ""This address has this number."" Beyond that, there is nothing - no ownership, no stored value, just numbers in a ledger telling holders their stake in empty bags.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

I started coinbase a month ago, and have lost about 2 grands.

I clicked on 'all' or '1Y' tab, since I only joined a month ago, I expect the numbers to be exactly the same - but in fact it showed more unrealized return on 1Y tab (1k++) vs All tab (800++ as you can see in screenshot).

Also, I have actually lost 2 grands - I have done a few trades, was down like 5 grands or something initially but managed to close the gap a little.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin's mempool cleared for first time since Jan 2023, sparking concerns of long-term security budget sustainability",2025-02-08 19:08:12,"**TL;DR**:

Last week, Bitcoin's mempool dropped to 0 vBytes, making it the first time this happened since Jan 2023. It means there is little demand for on-chain Bitcoin transactions.

On the positive side, Bitcoin fees are at the lowest they've been in years. On the negative side, this usually only happens during **bear markets**, and it shows that Bitcoin's **security budget is not sustainable** when the block subsidy is gone. Mining revenue collapses 10-100x whenever this happens, and revenue becomes extremely unstable.

For the past 2 years, Ordinals and Inscriptions have dominated activity, giving hope that Bitcoin's security budget could be sustained in the long run after the block subsidy programmatically collapse. But even Ordinals activity has dropped considerably recently as people flee away from memecoins.

> Overall, the mempool clearing coupled with transaction fees being stagnant is a reminder that Bitcoin mining needs Bitcoin to evolve into a robust platform for mining to remain a profitable business.

Also, are there any go-to books on crypto’s origins and purposes. Currently reading “Digital Gold” and enjoying it.


On top of this, I was wondering how effective charting is? Do the same patterns identified in stocks present themselves in crypto? And do these patterns occur because as humans our decisions en masse seem to follow patterns and repeat? Sort of charting as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,... Is it over?,2025-02-10 02:37:26,"Just curious what the general opinion is now. I'm getting the sinking feeling that this is my final window to take profits unless I want to wait another 4 years. I've brushed off every dip towards 100k, but after the stagnation and seeing it start to slip, it feels off. I felt as though we were still in for another pump to 120k at least, and that was the point I'd cash out. But its just hit this wall right before the mark I chose to take profits at. Am I just being weak? I'm aware a lot of this is ""I feel"" and not price graphs or data analysis, I'm more curious about the overall sentiment. The more it flatlines and slowly falls, the more I think I'm in the late game and its now or wait 4 years again.

One thing that keeps me holding still is the fact that large firms and whales are still buying up all they can as of very recently, leading me to take a sheep mentality since they clearly think there's more room to gain so I should hold out too. ",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Trouble using WhatToMine for hobby mining,2025-02-09 12:16:31,"I have a halfway decent rig (5950x and 6900xt) at home that's unused as I'm out of the country long term. I was thinking of repurposing it to try mining some altcoins. I'm not expecting to get rich, but it would be cool to make a little profit after electricity costs, and most importantly I think I'd enjoy it as a hobby. I can SSH in while I'm away and tweak it easily too.

I was using ChatGPT (4o) to do some calculations, and was pretty thrilled to see I could make a few $ mining KAS and ERG. I then found the site WhatToMine, but I think I'm doing something wrong. 

It's showing net profit in the negative for every coin. I tried putting in a 4090 instead of my 6900xt, same thing. At $0.14/kWh, the best I can do apparently is ALEO, losing -$0.01. I did notice that it doesn't seem to include a lot of altcoins, but it does have ERG, claiming a -$0.91 loss. ChatGPT spits out this:

""The **daily net profit** for a **6900 XT mining Ergo (ERG)** at **$0.14/kWh** is approximately **$3.56/day**.​""

Am I overlooking anything in WhatToMine, or should I just move on to another hobby (even if I went out and bought 2x4090's, which apparently will lose money too)?

If it helps, here's how I have it set up currently (6900xt + 4090 as I was thinking of getting a 4090):

The study is available in 30+ languages and it takes 5-10 minutes:

[https://survey.stateofcrypto.net/](https://survey.stateofcrypto.net/)

[Available languages \(Dutch to be added soon\)](https://preview.redd.it/bkydzlxf3zhe1.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bf631bec268528e8d08ede4a1c593c88e20be54)

The survey is approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Mannheim in Germany, and compliant with GDPR, the strictest data protection law of the world.

We respect all views pro and against crypto.

All results are public and contribute to scientific knowledge.

Finally, because this is our last announcement about the State of Crypto Survey, we want to especially thank the Mods for allowing us to post our study in this group. Without the support of this community so central to crypto our outreach would have been much more limited and our research would end up less impactful.

We are looking forward to disclose our first results in this group (before anywhere else) probably in one month time. Scientific publications will take much longer, several months or even a year, but we will post updates about those as well.

As usual, if you have any questions or feedback, do not hesitate to get in contact.

I could put $1,000 in and barely make anything.

I could go for the much cheaper “altcoins”, like PEPE, but that’s more volatile and risky, and $100 still won’t make me that much of it it goes from $0.000010 to $0.000020.

If you don’t have a degree, or a driver’s license, it’s even harder to get a better job in the immediate term, especially if it’s remote.

I’m not even asking for get rich quick methods (but wouldn’t hesitate if it was likely, I’m getting more desperate).

You simply have to keep enduring suffering, whether that be in an abusive household, or homeless. There’s no quick way out, and in bad living circumstances it’s harder to build to anything longterm either.

[Ethereum Gwei](https://preview.redd.it/bcpwxibntnhe1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d50dc776860b7d41df01eb0d114209a2c8ae94)

As you can see in the image above Gwei is currently at 0.986 ($0.06) at High priority which is really cheap comparing with what we have seen in the past before. If you have been here for a long time you will understand, I suggest you to search your wallet address on Etherscan, click on Analytics tab and then on TxnFees tab to enjoy watching how much you paid on ETH gas fees in the past xD

This low fees made me think that Ethereum transactions have decreased and are low right now so I decided to check it but I am quite surprised.

As you can see in the chart above Ethereum daily transactions are 2021 levels with 1,333,804 transactions yesterday. This confirms us that people are still using Ethereum actively even if the price is not in a great place. It also confirms us that all the upgrades released during this last years are working like a charm even if the inflation has raised a bit but I think that ""problem"" will be solved soon with some changes that are coming. Its also great to see how L2s are also working as expected in the whole Ethereum scalability roadmap absorbing traffic and reducing congestion on L1.

This is bullish because it makes Ethereum competitive with other alternative chains, it is not suffering from low demand and keeps evolving.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Crypto: A Glorified Storage of Nothing,2025-02-09 12:13:33,"Cryptocurrencies (crypto) are often portrayed as revolutionary decentralized systems, but the truth is that they are just online storage systems securing units of nothing. Crypto wallets display numbers, making it seem like users own a certain amount of something. But the reality is that those numbers represent nothing. People may call it an asset, a coin, money, value, digital gold, or digital property, but in the end, all they have are numbers calculated by the systems and assigned to their addresses. Then, using wallet apps, they transfer these numbers to other addresses. And that’s it. It’s just the reassignment of units of nothing. Crypto holders cannot prove they own anything real in the amount of assigned numbers, nothing that exists or functions outside of that reassignment process.

Now, let’s consider what it means to actually hold units of something. When people hold stocks, they own units of an actual company, with those units being used to receive profits, buybacks, or liquidation value. When they hold dollars, they own units of an actual debt within the U.S. banking system, with the units being used by debtors to redeem that debt. When they hold digital audio or video files, they own units of an actual good that is used for entertainment. When they hold gold, they own units of an actual metal that is used in electronics, jewelry, and industry. And when they hold art or sports cards, they own units of an actual resource used for aesthetic, historical, or cultural purposes.

But in the case of crypto, no one can point to something and show its use for a specific purpose. That’s because holding crypto means holding units of nothing. Crypto holders claim to own a certain amount of something, yet they can never show anything that functions as in the above examples, where we had units of a company, debt, digital goods, or metal. If someone asks a crypto holder to prove what they truly own, the only response is an abstract term like ""coin,"" ""digital gold,"" ""asset,"" ""value,"" or ""money."" But they cannot show a real, functional item that does something in the real world. This clearly proves that they hold units of nothing, which are merely sent back and forth within the system.

Despite this, crypto believers insist they own something. That’s what makes it both absurd and hilarious. Systems in which they hold no real ownership still convince them that they own valuable assets. But this isn’t just a flaw, it’s the entire foundation of crypto. It survives on belief, persuading people that the numbers assigned to their addresses represent ownership of something, even though they can never explain where that something is or what it actually does.

Crypto is not an asset, money, a product, a resource, or a store of value because all of those are units of something real. Crypto is a digital illusion, an online storage system for units of nothing, while its ""transactions"" are not transfers of ownership but merely changes representing who currently holds the empty bags.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Unfortunately I missed the big spike in Sushi and did not sell.  But everytime I would log onto the site I had a bitch of a time locating my staked coins.  I should have approx. $1,000 to $1,500 but cannot find it.  I see the original transactions, but others more recent I cannot recognize.  I'm looking for my seed phrase to restore the wallet to a different browser.  Maybe someone else is better at reading these transactions than I am.  

Also, I was kicked off of Binance as a US trader about 4 years ago and sent my XRP into the wrong wallet.  It went to a Binance address in my Metamask wallet and was never able to retrieve it.  It was only about $.25 then but is now worth about $3.00 and around $4,000 now.  If anyone knows of a way to recover my coins I'd be ecstatic.  I cannot sent back to the original Binance address because they will not deal with US customers, so I hope my 4k is not lost.   

I used to be very good at these transactions, but have just let kind of ignored my wallet and let the funds sit.  I would never keep the funds on the exchange for any period of time, but they coins were staked.  I can't find them which is not unusual, but there are transactions I don't recognize.  I'll check back tomorrow and can hopefully find someone more knowledgeable.   Thanks in advance. ",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,I was explained how to know if a given qth root can be used for elliptic curve pairing inversion. But what he did mean ?,2024-12-13 16:29:27,"There are many research papers that propose to lower the problem of fixed pairing inversion to exponentiation inversion. I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

I know what’s an elliptic curve billinear pairing. I know what’s the order and the embedding degree of an elliptic curve, but I understood nothing else from his answer.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358
Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

EDIT: seeing as all answers proposed seem to be missing the point it seems my post was very unclear. I invite anyone not to waste their time on this post anymore and if I find a better way to present what I'm talking about I'll create a new one.",2025-02-10 12:19:15.637358

We don’t hear about the attack on finite fields of large characteristics since such curves are already secure by being prime. **However, I notice a few protocol relies on the discrete logarithm security on curves with 400/500 bits modulus resulting from extension fields of characteristics that are 200/245bits long**.

Im relatively in the cryptography field and im facing a problem for wich i cant find a solution.  
I have recieved some homeworks at my university where they gave me a ciphered file and some clues to get the password. I think I have the pass or atleast i have the bases to find the real one but muy problem is that i dont actually know what cipher method is used so i have no way to apply the password, wich haves one of the next forms:  
1CCD8A4  
1CCD8A41CCD8A4  
1CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A4

Is there any way to know wich cypher is being used? or is there any way to set a password to a file so it opens deciphered?
