Crypto Analyst Reveals Why The Dogecoin Price Is Primed For A Surge To $20,2024-11-17 00:00:29+00:00,"Crypto analyst John Burr on TradingView has discussed the potential for the Dogecoin price to reach $3 this market cycle. Driven by the positive sentiments from recent political events spearheaded by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Burr has revealed that Dogecoin can not only reach $3 but could skyrocket to $20. US Politics Could Drive DOGE To $3 According to the TradingView analyst, the Dogecoin price could be preparing for a strong bull run to the $3 target. In his report, Burrs discussed the effects of political changes on the crypto market, underscoring the changes the recent US Presidential elections have had on the Dogecoin price.  Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Entered The ‘Thrill’ Phase, Here’s What To Expect Next Based on its price chart, Burr claims that Dogecoin is repeating historical trends which signal an impending bull rally. The analyst also mentioned a correlation to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), hinting at future government actions or pro-crypto regulations indirectly impacting cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration ceremony as the 47th US President could also trigger the next bullish movement in the crypto market. As a result, Burr predicts that the Dogecoin price could surge to $3 on Inauguration Day. Considering that Dogecoin is trading below the $1 mark, the analyst has acknowledged that his bullish predictions for the meme coin could be wrong. He is focusing instead on the broader crypto bull market. He revealed that the market is currently at the beginning of the bull run, which gives Dogecoin more wiggle room for growth. Burrs has revealed that to some analysts, a $3 price target for Dogecoin may be conservative as they have projected extreme targets around the $40 level by next year. The analyst noted that skeptical crypto experts are unlikely to forecast an ATH beyond $3 for the DOGE price, primarily citing market cap concerns. This suggests that the DOGE market cap will have to exceed that of significant cryptocurrencies, possibly surpassing Bitcoin before it can reach $40.  This substantial price and market cap increase appears unattainable, as it would require a sustained, strong demand and investor interest in Dogecoin. However, due to its meme coin status and the frequent occurrence of negative market conditions, maintaining such extensive demand could pose a challenge for Dogecoin, which remains vulnerable to market fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volume Crashes 27% As Price Falls, What Does This Say About The Decline? Can The Dogecoin Price Reach $20? In his TradingView post, Burr also highlighted the possibility of the Dogecoin price reaching new highs at $20. The analysts acknowledged his doubts about the feasibility of this ambitious price leap, which stands in sharp contrast to his earlier confidence in the $3 prediction for the DOGE price.  A $20 target represents a massive price increase for Dogecoin, which is currently trading at $0.37. Dogecoin will have to experience price gains of about 5,300%, driven by extremely bullish conditions, favorable market sentiment, and widespread adoption.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Surges Past $93,000 – Can A Breakthrough Unlock New Heights?",2024-11-16 22:30:26+00:00,"Bitcoin is on the move again, surging toward its previous high of $93,257 with renewed momentum that has triggered excitement among traders. After a period of consolidation, Bitcoin’s latest price action signals a potential breakout that could set the stage for even greater gains. As it inches closer to this critical resistance level, can the crypto giant break through and unlock new heights, or will the bears reclaim control? With the market’s eyes fixed on this pivotal moment, the next move could reshape BTC’s future. This analysis aims to explore Bitcoin’s current surge toward the $93,257 resistance level and assess the likelihood of a breakout. By examining key technical indicators and market trends, it seeks to determine whether BTC can overcome this significant hurdle and reach new highs. Additionally, it will explore the possible impact of such a breakthrough on its price trajectory and the broader market sentiment. Bitcoin’s Renewed Momentum Leading To $93,257 Bitcoin is currently maintaining a bullish stance, holding firmly above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, a strong indicator of continued upward momentum. The price now aims for its previous high of $93,257, having successfully avoided a drop below the $85,211 support. If this pressure continues, a break above $93,257 could create a path for new highs, while holding above the $85,211 support level signals strength in the ongoing rally. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a continued upside movement as the RSI climbs to 61% after dipping to 53%, signaling that the market is maintaining its bullish strength. Significantly, the sustained rise in the RSI suggests that the uptrend is gaining traction with the potential for more price increases as the buying pressure builds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Gains 10%: Is The $100K Dream Closer Than Ever? Additionally, the daily chart reveals that BTC is experiencing strong upbeat momentum, highlighted by the formation of bullish candlesticks. The asset’s position well above the key 100-day SMA further reinforces this positive trend. As BTC maintains its current trajectory, it bolsters market optimism, setting the stage for additional gains as it aims for the $93,257 target. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is at 92%, indicating strong positive movement after recovering from a dip to 77% suggesting a shift in market sentiment with increased buying pressure. While the high RSI points to continued growth, prolonged overbought conditions may lead to a correction if buying activity begins to wane. Key Resistance: Can Bitcoin Push Through? Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance level at $93,257, a price point that could determine the next phase of its bullish trajectory. If Bitcoin successfully surpasses $93,257, it could pave the way for new highs, indicating continued strength in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters ‘Second Breakout Of The Cycle,’ Analyst Puts Peak Above $150,000 However, if the resistance holds, Bitcoin could experience a pullback or consolidation, with the price retracing toward the $83,211 support level.

Amidst Bitcoin’s journey to the $90,000 price zone, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency emerged as one of the biggest weekly gainers with a 60.76% price increase.  Following this price surge, a crypto analyst with X username BarriC has provided some interesting predictions on XRP’s future. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Booms: $44 Million In Transactions As Activity Soars XRP To Reach $10 In Bull Market, But There’s More  In an X post on November 15, BarriC released several price targets for XRP tied to certain conditions. Firstly, the analyst forecasted XRP to attain a market price between $6-$10 in the crypto bull run, representing a minimum potential 500% gain on the token’s present price.  These high expectations by BarriC are rather not uncommon due to several factors especially  Donald Trump’s recent electoral victory which is expected to usher in a crypto-friendly US government.  For XRP, the Republican President sticking to his electoral crypto manifesto holds massive importance as it may bring a decisive end to the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and permanently halt the regulatory uncertainty over the token.  In addition, Trump’s presidency also boosts the possibility of the XRP spot ETF with the SEC expected to present fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto-linked securities. Following approval, BarriC postulates a spot ETF can drive the altcoin to a market price of $15-$20 if approval comes amidst the bull market run.  Furthermore, the analyst discusses a utility run during which the altcoin will undergo massive adoption in its use for cross-border transactions and as an institutional bridge cryptocurrency for banks. If the utility run occurs as predicted with global adoption levels of XRP, BarriC forecasts the altcoin to attain a minimal price of $100.

The coin rose from around $0.69 to reach a local peak of $0.92 as  Gary Gensler “supposedly” hinted at a resignation as SEC chairman.  While the altcoin has recorded a slight price decline of 1.2% in the past hour, the massive purchase by whales indicates a belief in the asset for long-term profitability. At the time of writing. XRP trades at 0.89, with his market cap value now above $50 billion. In tandem, the token’s trading volume is up by 24.71% and valued at $11.75 billion.

As the market rides the bull wave spearheaded by Bitcoin, a crypto analyst has identified the current phase of the market using the Wyckoff Cycle. This analysis suggests that altcoins are preparing for a “parabolic run” that could kickstart the onset of the altcoin season.  Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K? Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast Wyckoff Cycle Reveals What Phase The Current Market Has Entered  A crypto technical analyst identified as EtherNasyonal has shared a chart of the crypto total market cap, excluding Bitcoin. In this chart, the Wyckoff cycle, a widely used framework for understanding market behavior and trends, can be seen. The chart showed four distinct market phases — Accumulation, Mark up, Distribution, and Mark down. The accumulation phase is the period when smart money begins buying assets at lower prices, and prices consolidate as selling pressure reduces. Once the accumulation phase completes, the Markup phase begins, where prices break out of the consolidation range and begin an uptrend driven by increased demand. The next phase, the Distribution stage, is characterized by selling pressure, where smart money begins selling its holdings, leading to price corrections or stabilization. After this stage, the Markdown phase starts, where selling pressure overwhelms demand, triggering a downtrend.  Based on these unique phases, the crypto analyst has revealed that the market is currently in the Mark up phase, highlighted by an increase in the prices of various cryptocurrencies. By 2025, 2026, and 2027, the total market is expected to enter a re-accumulation phase, another mark up phase, and a distribution phase, respectively.  The right side of the chart also shows a continuation of these distinct market phases, with 2027 to 2030 set to witness an accumulation, mark up, and distribution stage.  Here’s When The Altcoin Season Could Begin Based on EtherNasyonal’s Wyckoff cycle chart, the altcoin season is set to commence, with altcoins already preparing to experience a parabolic run. The altcoin season is a period when cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, experience significant price increases and often outperform Bitcoin significantly. Based on the past bull market,  the altcoins that led the previous altcoin season include Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and others.  The crypto analyst has revealed that the altcoin season will begin after the reaccumulation phase in the Wyckoff crypto market chart. The reaccumulation phase is set to take place in 2025, following the Mark up phase in 2024.  Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor In this reaccumulation phase, the analyst expects altcoins to experience an epic rise that could lead to a strong and bullish altcoin season. The Bitcoin price performance is also set to influence this anticipated altcoin season, as a Bitcoin bull run has historically preceded past altcoin seasons. Moreover, as the market sees a decrease in Bitcoin’s dominance and increased demand for altcoins, this could signal that the altcoin season may be imminent.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Could Soon Break $100,000, Blockchain Firm Explains How",2024-11-16 18:00:58+00:00,"The Bitcoin price continued its red-hot form over the past week, printing successive all-time highs in less than five days. While Donald Trump’s success at the United States elections might have kickstarted the recent rally, the growth of the premier cryptocurrency — and the general crypto market — seems to have developed a life of its own. Interestingly, the market has been left wondering where the next market top is, with some pundits and commentators believing that the BTC price rally has come to an end. However, a prominent on-chain analytics firm has come forward to say that the Bitcoin price still has room for some upside movement. Four Reasons Why $100,000 Is Possible For Bitcoin Price: CryptoQuant In its latest weekly report, CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is yet to be overvalued despite its recent positive momentum. According to the blockchain platform, the market leader could soon reach the highly-coveted price level of $100,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Explodes 112% – Is $1 The New Target After This Historic Rally? The rationale behind this projection is based on valuable metrics, such as the MVRV (market value to realized value) ratio. As the name suggests, this indicator measures the ratio between the market value and the realized value of a cryptocurrency. As such, the MVRV helps to assess the tops and bottoms of the Bitcoin market. CryptoQuant noted that Bitcoin is not yet overvalued at the current price levels, as the MVRV metric is still outside the overvalued region. This ultimately means that the bullish price action is not overheated, and the Bitcoin price could still make a play for higher prices. What’s more, the Trader On-chain Realized max band is pointing to $100,000 as the next target for the Bitcoin price. According to CryptoQuant, the last time the max band reached its current level was in March 2024 when the premier cryptocurrency surpassed the $70,000 level for the first time. Another on-chain observation that supports the continuous Bitcoin price rally is the demand growth. CryptoQuant highlighted that investor demand in the United States has returned since the presidential election, with Coinbase Premium remaining positive in the past few days. Finally, crypto market liquidity has continued to increase over the past few weeks, as stablecoins make their onto exchanges.  For context, more than $3.2 billion in USDT has flowed into exchanges since the US election, signaling the potential of a sustained Bitcoin price rally. Tread With Caution However, CryptoQuant sounded a warning in its report, saying that some selling action could follow the recent price rally. While some Bitcoin miners have started offloading their assets for profit, the blockchain firm also noted that the Bitcoin selling seen so far is still insignificant but could rise quickly soon.

Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor According to reports, investors who initially claimed that Musk manipulated Dogecoin’s price have withdrawn their complaint. Also, the group is withdrawing its bid to sanction Musk’s lawyers for supposedly interfering with the appeal, including canceling a request to cover their legal fees. The lawsuit alleged that Tesla and Musk influenced Dogecoin’s price through social media posts and public statements. They highlighted Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2021, arguing that the Tesla owner made remarks influencing the token’s price, allowing him to profit from these price swings. Elon Musk Public Statements And Stunts ‘Influenced Dogecoin Price’ Investors filed a case against Musk in response to his statements and posts that supposedly influenced the Dogecoin price. The lawsuit highlighted Musk’s presence in NBC’s Saturday Night Live in 2021, where he shared his views on Dogecoin, pushing the token’s price to increase. According to the complainants, Musk manipulated the market to his benefit. They claimed that Musk manipulated the market through postings on Twitter/X, adding the tag “Dogecoin CEO” and using the DOGE symbol as part of his bio. The group alleged that the token’s price surged after Musk commented, including a statement that Tesla will accept Dogecoin as a payment method. The complainants were seeking damages of $258 billion from Elon Musk. Court Dismisses Case Against Tesla CEO The court has already dismissed the case against Tesla and Musk last August. In dismissing the case, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein argued that the complainants cannot prove securities solely based on Musk’s post on social media. The judge added that Musk’s statement, saying that Dogecoin is the world’s future currency, can be used to buy Tesla, and can “fly to the moon, are considered “aspirational and puffery” and not necessarily factual. In short, Judge Hellerstein explained that no reasonable person should rely on posts to complain about securities fraud. The judge further noted that it would be challenging to show and prove insider trading and market manipulation claims based on posts alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K?

What could this mean for the price of the premier cryptocurrency? What Does The Falling NVT Golden Cross Mean For Price? In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Burakkesmeci revealed that the price of Bitcoin might have reached a “local bottom.” This exciting prognosis is based on the latest movement by the “NVT Golden Cross” metric. For context, the “Network Value to Transactions” ratio is an on-chain indicator that estimates the difference between the Bitcoin market capitalization and transaction volume. Typically, a high NVT value signals that an asset’s price is high compared to the network’s transaction volume, suggesting that the coin is overvalued. Related Reading: BNB Price Poised for Takeoff: Will It Be The Next to Rally? Conversely, when the value of the NVT metric is low, it implies that the coin’s market value is small relative to the transaction volume. Usually, this indicates that the asset is undervalued and its price could still have room for upside movement. Now, the Golden Cross indicator is a modified iteration of the NVT ratio, and it helps to mark gradual buy and sell zones in short-term trends. According to Burakkesmeci explained that when the NVT GC exceeds 2.2 (the red zone), it means that the price in a short-term trend is overheating (and the formation of a potential local top). On the other hand, the NVT Golden Cross dipping below -1.6 suggests that the price decline is wearing out, signaling a potential bottom. Burakkesmeci noted that these local tops and bottoms are regions rather than just precise levels. As shown in the chart above, the NVT Golden Cross has crossed beneath -1.6 and is currently around -3.3, suggesting that the Bitcoin price is at a local bottom. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, this could represent a “gradual buying opportunity” for investors looking to get into the market. Bitcoin Market In Extreme Greed Investors will want to proceed with caution especially as the Bitcoin market seems to be overheating in the long term. According to another CryptoQuant analyst, the Fear & Greed Index has flagged extreme greed for the premier cryptocurrency. Typically, when the Fear & Greed Index moves toward one end, there is a potential for market reversal depending on the sentiment. In this case, where the market is in extreme greed, the Bitcoin price may be about to witness a correction.

Analyst Explains",2024-11-16 13:30:58+00:00,"While Bitcoin has faced strong bullish momentum in recent weeks, achieving new all-time highs consistently for days, Ethereum has been an underperformer, unable to catch up with BTC’s bullish pace. Even compared to other crypto assets (altcoins) in the market, Ethereum has failed to make a major rally that melts faces. Instead, as Bitcoin achieved a peak above $93,000, leading the overall crypto market in a bullish market, Ethereum has only been able to surge to just $3,396 over the same period BTC broke multiple resistances to achieve consistent new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price at $3,000: Can Support Prevent Further Losses? So far, ETH remains roughly a 37.5% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878, seen 3 years ago in November 2021. At the time of writing, the asset faces a correction alongside the rest of the crypto market, including Bitcoin. ETH has declined by 2.3% in the past day, currently trading at $3,023. Why is Ethereum Struggling to Catch Up? The underperformance of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin has caught the attention of market analysts. One key observation comes from a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, who provided a possible explanation for Ethereum’s price stagnation. According to Darkfost, the taker buy-sell ratio is a crucial metric to consider, particularly on the Binance exchange. This ratio is an indicator of short-term market sentiment, and when it remains below 1, it suggests there is more selling pressure than buying interest. It can also indicate a hesitation among traders to accumulate ETH at current levels, which could contribute to a lagging price performance. Darkfost noted: The taker buy-sell ratio on Binance remains bearish, as it has been below 1 most of the time over the past month. This indicates that traders are more willing to sell than buy ETH, which could explain why ETH is currently underperforming compared to BTC. Is There Still Hope For ETH? Despite Ethereum’s struggle to match Bitcoin’s gains, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of ETH. For example, a well-known crypto analyst, Kingpin Crypto, expressed a bullish sentiment regarding ETH at its current price levels. In a recent post on X, Kingpin Crypto suggested that ETH trading around the $3,000 mark presents a notable buying opportunity. $ETH – Buy with conviction around the orange line and retire.

According to the chart shared by Yoddha, ETH’s historical price movements often include a phase of retesting followed by a sharp surge in value.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Dogecoin Price Down 7%, But Whales Continue To Buy",2024-11-16 12:00:01+00:00,"On-chain data shows the Dogecoin whales have continued to buy recently despite the pullback that the memecoin’s price has suffered. Dogecoin Whales Have Just Added 140 Million DOGE To Their Wallets As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Dogecoin whales have continued their buying push during the last 24 hours. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which keeps track of the total amount of DOGE that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, contains all investors who own between 1 and 10 DOGE. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Is Finally Back: These Metrics Point To An Explosion In Interest In the context of the current topic, the 10 million to 100 million coins group is of focus. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of this range converts to about $3.7 million, while the upper one to $37 million. These are clearly significant amounts, so the only investors who would qualify for this cohort would be the big-money ones. The group certainly doesn’t include all holders of this kind as the upper limit is ‘just’ $37 million, but it does the contain smaller of the whales, who are still an important part of the DOGE ecosystem. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution specifically for this Dogecoin group over the past few weeks: From the above graph, it’s visible that the Dogecoin supply held by these whales has been riding an uptrend recently, with a particularly sharp increase coming during the past few days, coinciding with DOGE’s massive rally. Considering this timing, it’s likely that these investors have been helping support the run. In the last 24 hours, the memecoin has seen a reversal in direction, with its price suffering a pullback of around 7% as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has registered a red day. Interestingly, despite the decline, the Supply Distribution for the 10 million to 100 million coins group has continued to head up. In total, these humongous investors have added a net 140 million DOGE to their holdings, worth almost $52 million at the moment. This accumulation naturally suggests that the whales don’t think that the rally is over just yet. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Co. Take Over Social Media: Why Memecoin Frenzy Is Bad For Bitcoin It only remains to be seen, though, whether the positive sentiment from these large investors can induce a fresh surge in Dogecoin, or if their bet would fail this time around. DOGE Price Even though Dogecoin has seen a notable drawdown since its top, the meme coin’s investors would still make significant profits as the asset’s weekly returns sit at a positive 88%.

Analyst Forecast 2021-Like Rally,2024-11-16 11:00:00+00:00,"Cardano (ADA) has seen a massive rally in the last few weeks, surging over 81% in the past fourteen days. As the cryptocurrency continues breaking past key levels, a renowned crypto analyst highlighted its potential 2,000% climb. Related Reading: Analysts Bullish On Dogwifhat (WIF) $5 Target As Price Retests $4 Resistance Cardano To Hit $6 By Q3 2025 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez forecasted that Cardano might hit the $6 mark by September 2025. Earlier this year, the analyst noted that ADA’s chart reassembled a pattern similar to 2020, which suggests that the cryptocurrency could experience a rally like 2020-2021’s bull run. Per the post, ADA broke out from its two-year consolidation in early 2020 before retracing 75% and consolidating for most of the year. By November 2020, the token bounced from the accumulation range and started its massive 4,000% rally, which lasted around nine months. This year, Cardano has seen a similar move during the first leg of the cycle, reaching its year-high of $0.81 before retracing 75% and consolidating between the $0.6-$0.27 price range for the last eight months. Following the crypto market’s recent rally, fueled by Trump’s victory in the US elections and the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce interest rates by 0.25, Cardano has experienced a massive 50% weekly surge. Martinez previously forecasted that ADA could experience the second leg’s initial jump on November 18, around two weeks after the US elections. However, the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $0.6 support zone and broke above the $0.65 horizontal level earlier today. This performance represents an eight-month high for Cardano, which has been heavily criticized for underperforming against most altcoins. According to the chart, ADA might move sideways around this range for the following days before challenging its year-high price. If ADA continues replicating the last cycle’s pattern, the cryptocurrency could reach the long-awaited $1 by year-end. Additionally, it could surpass its previous $3.09 all-time high (ATH) by Q1 2025 before entering price discovery mode. Martinez suggested that Cardano could rise over 2,000% toward the $6 mark, reaching its top between July and September 2025. ADA Among Today’s Market Leaders While most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 move sideways, ADA has soared 21 % in the last 24 hours. The token surged as the third-best performer today, behind XRP and ALGO. Besides the general economic and geopolitical factors, its recent performance has also been fueled by speculation surrounding Cardano’s potential involvement with Trump’s administration. On Thursday, a member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the United Nations (UN), Shawn, shared on X that re-elected President Trump is exploring a federal voting and identity verification system based on blockchain technology. Related Reading: Dogecoin Frenzy Arrives In Korea: ‘Kimchi Premium’ Returns Amid DOGE’s 110% Rally Speculation arose when another X user claimed that Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson is “already in talks with the Trump administration,” arguing that “they’ve been working with the state of Wyoming on voting systems for a couple of years now.” Cardano has rallied an impressive 84% in the last month, breaking above the $0.65 mark for the first time since late March and recovering its top 10 crypto spot. As of this writing, ADA trades at $0.67. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,solana,Unstaking delayed on SOL since 10-31-2024 - update and info leak ,2024-11-17 00:44:24,"sorry for the long post in advance… but here’s an update. 

I managed to meet one of the people on the technical team that is aware of the problem. This person is not working directly on it though but has a good idea of what's going on.

So, from what I understood. The issue started with a massive unstake request 5 days before the US presidential election, at the same time as some issues with the Solana network, i.e., whilst it was also congested. This did not cause any other staking service or platform ANY prolonged issues, except for Coinbase.

This level of network disruption is normally fine, as the unstake would be pushed down to the next epoch in different batches and released. BUT, something on Coinbase’s side went wrong and unstaking was frozen, this could have been an issue with the Coinbase validator. I.e. causing a technical bottleneck in their own staking service aggregated by the sudden spike in demand.

Since the validator operations didnt sync properly with the Sol network AND their batch processing system failed, unstake requests became stuck and a massive backlog was caused. As this was off the back of the start of this massive bull run - management decided to sideline it and focus all the energy on profiteering and ensuring other systems (e.g. trading, futures) run smoothly, as they make them money.

They had a small team focus on it and tried running a manual review process for large withdrawals whilst some system errors persisted, however, this means they were only processing small unstake requests whilst the bigger ones in the batch from 10-31-2024 are sitting in limbo. So, many of the users that had their small Sol amounts unstake normally were part of this process.

The engineer has said this is DEFINITELY a Coinbase specific issue and is not tied up to Sol’s blockchain, rather it is more of an internal glitch that they are unable to resolve which is also coupled with a capacity problem.

The engineer said they need to fix the glitch and run a few test runs to ensure the Sol is not lost forever, so this will add to the delay significantly, and they are not even at that point yet. Apparently, this glitch has never happened to this extent and is quite serious, management have asked technical teams and support to keep it quiet and ensure no updates or details are released, and that no detailed responses or information is leaked as it is now classified as 'technical negligence' and makes Coinbase fully liable… meaning, if users sue them then they are in a position to win and have Coinbase pay off A LOT of money. He also said, because they are not willing to publicly address this issue or admit to it, it puts them in a worse position than if they addressed it immediately, as it creates a second level of negligence and known fault, whilst holding users money.

Also, an important point the engineer raised was this was not made a priority initially as Coinbase was heavily benefiting from the bull run, and put all its resources on that instead. Now, management is panicking because they are still unable to resolve this, and are worried news might get out, causing users to lose trust in Coinbase.

I have basically begged this engineer to sneak me some more intel and ANY email exchanges as evidence ALL of us can use to address this in court if the time comes… Lets see if I can manage that. Would appreciate if anyone else can come forward regarding this issue too. ",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,solana,Gauging Interest on Options Protocol (waitlist?),2024-11-16 21:40:21,"Hey gang,

I made this post two weeks ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1gfyqn5/comment/lulmhn4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1gfyqn5/comment/lulmhn4/) to see if people were interested in an options protocol on Solana.

Now I'm starting to wrap up the beta of the platform and wanted to get more feedback from the community and possibly initial testers for those that are enthusiastic.

I'm going to start off with just SOL, but how it'll work is people can stake their underlying (e.g. SOL) and essentially write options to other market participants and collect premium on their SOL.

Example is provided of how it works is below:

>Seller holds 1 SOL. Current price is 215. Let's say they are OK with selling an option at a $220 strike price, expiring within a week (Nov22). The seller would stake the 1 SOL and set their premium price (current premiums are running at about $9 for this scenario).

>So in summary, upon purchase:

>Seller immediately receives $9 per SOL from buyer. In 1 week, seller may receive either an additional $220, or their 1 SOL back.

>Buyer pays seller $9. In 1 week, they can buy SOL at $220 no matter the circumstances. If SOL is trading at $250 for example, buyer can buy SOL at $220 and immediately sell it for $250, profiting $250 - $220 - $7 = $23.00, which is around 250% gain. Seller would just lose out on the potential gains and just get their $220.

>If SOL trades at $200 next week, buyer would have no incentive to exercise the option, so they just lose their $9. Seller just gets their 1 SOL back (but also gets to keep the $9).

Is this something you would use? (https://daption.xyz/ waitlist if interested, & follow https://x.com/daptionxyz/ on X!)

The basic idea is gamifying daily life through quests, guilds, and a marketplace - all powered by the Solana blockchain. 

Here's how it works:

App Features:
- Complete daily quests and missions to earn GSALT tokens
- Join guilds to tackle bigger projects and share resources
- Trade items and assets in a community marketplace
- Level up your profile and build reputation
- Real-world impact through ventures

Quests range from simple daily tasks to bigger community challenges. Think Pokemon Go meets tech startup incubator.

Guilds are like clans or DAOs - you can team up with others, pool resources, and work on bigger projects together. Each guild can specialize in different areas (tech, community, etc).

Marketplace lets you trade assets, invest in ventures, and manage guild resources. Everything runs on Solana for fast, cheap transactions.

Would love to hear your thoughts on:
- Would you play something like this?
- What features interest you most?
- What would make you want to join a guild?
- Any concerns about the concept?

This is still early days and we're looking to build this with the community. Happy to share more details in the comments!",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

### 🎓 Midwest Blockchain Conference Recap

The [Midwest Blockchain Conference (MBC)](https://midwestblockchain.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org), held at the University of Michigan, gathered over 1,000 attendees, including students from 30+ universities, representatives from 40 blockchain companies, and 50 industry leaders. 

The event served as a space where blockchain clubs from across Midwest colleges and universities could connect and bridge the gap between talented students and blockchain companies. 

While this wasn't a Solana focused event, in the conversations I was involved in Solana was a hot topic. 

A good example of this was the packed house at u/adlonymous' [Intro to Solana](https://x.com/ttu_waa/status/1854965917232644523?ref=blog.colosseum.org) session.

I went to sessions on Sei and Sui right after and the attendance dropped off significantly. I'm not saying that to knock either platform, attendees have probably just heard more about Solana going into the event, but it does show the high level of interest in Solana. 

Colosseum made a contribution too as Nate Levine talked about student onboarding through hackathons, how some of the biggest projects got started on Solana, and how the Colosseum Hackathons and Accelerator help launch new projects.

I did feel just a bit out of place as the ""old guy"" at an event aimed at college students, but I got to meet a lot of great people and become even more bullish on Solana seeing the next generation of builders learning and working together!

### 🍴 Minimum Fork Viability

Minimum Fork Viability (MFV) is a framework focused on building projects that aren’t just usable products but act as robust, adaptable foundations for future innovation. 

For Solana developers, MFV is about creating applications or protocols with the infrastructure, clarity, and flexibility needed to allow other teams to fork or build upon them effectively. 

MFV shifts the goal from simply creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to developing a foundation that others can extend, modify, or even reimagine.

It’s not just about making a functioning project but about designing it with future builders in mind. For Solana developers, this means creating dApps, protocols, and tools that can be easily forked, improved, and adapted, contributing to the overall health and growth of the Solana ecosystem.

Solana’s thriving developer community benefits when projects can be forked and adapted, creating an environment of rapid innovation. 

Forkable projects allow developers to customize for niche needs, improve upon core innovations, and contribute to a shared ecosystem. 

By providing detailed documentation and adhering to Solana’s best practices, you help other developers understand your contributions and make it easier for them to build upon your work.

By focusing on extensibility, robust documentation, clear architecture, and community engagement, Solana projects can become cornerstones of innovation within the ecosystem.

# Measuring Solana’s Decentralization: Facts and Figures

https://preview.redd.it/0h2h4e1wp31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3009e62379bfd72d319ac2a9bfc255deb8792fd1

## Actionable Insights

* The Solana network is distributed across 4,514 nodes, including 1,414 validators and 3,100 RPCs (epoch 685). No single validator controls more than 3.2% of the total stake.
* The Nakamoto Coefficient (NC) represents the smallest number of independent entities that can maliciously conspire to cause a liveness failure, denying the consensus needed for new block production. Solana's Nakamoto Coefficient is frequently cited as 19. The actual figure is likely lower since individual entities can permissionlessly operate multiple validators anonymously.
* Solana’s validator set spans 37 countries and territories. The largest concentration is in America, with 508 validators. Four jurisdictions each hold over 10% of stake: the US with 18.3%, the Netherlands and the UK, both at 13.7%, and Germany with 13.2%.
* 68% of stake is delegated to European validators, with 20% delegated to North America. 50.5% of stake is delegated to validators operating within the European Union (European stake excluding Norway, Ukraine, and the UK).
* The validator set is dispersed across 135 different hosting providers. The two leading providers are Teraswitch, a privately owned U.S. company hosting validators with a combined 24% of stake, and Latitude.sh (formerly Maxihost), a Brazilian-based provider of low-cost bare metal servers used by validators with a combined 19% of stake.
* The Agave client codebase has 357 individual contributors. The Firedancer client, developed by a small team under the leadership of chief science officer Kevin Bowers, currently has 57 contributors.
* The Jito client, a fork of the original Agave codebase that includes an out-of-protocol block space auction, currently holds a dominant 88% share of the network's stake. However, this is expected to change considerably over the next twelve months as the new Firedancer client is gradually introduced and integrated into the ecosystem. Solana and Ethereum stand out as the only Layer 1 blockchains currently offering multiple client implementations.
* Substantial changes to Solana’s core components undergo a formal and public [**Solana Improvement and Development (SIMD)**](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents) proposal process. The most significant protocol-altering changes, especially those affecting economic parameters, undergo governance votes. So far, three such votes have taken place.
* The Solana Foundation, established in June 2019, is a Swiss-registered non-profit organization dedicated to growing and supporting the Solana ecosystem. The SF’s relatively lean team of 60-65 full-time employees oversees funding for grants, staking programs, and developer tools.
* Additionally, there is strong evidence of geographical diversity among the Solana developer community. The most recent bi-annual hackathon, Radar, drew 13,672 participants from 156 countries, with notable participation from India, Nigeria, the U.S., and Vietnam. SuperTeam, a network connecting Solana creatives, developers, and operators, has expanded to 1,300 members in 16 countries.

## What is Decentralization?

Decentralization can be summarized as the lack of a single point of failure within a system. This multifaceted concept spans many dimensions, including token distribution, the influence of key figures, permissionless network participation, control over development, and software/hardware diversity. Quantifying a blockchain’s level of decentralization has few universally accepted standards outside of Balaji’s Nakamoto Coefficient. Many metrics are imperfect. Moreover, discussions around blockchain decentralization, often [**rooted in political philosophy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization), give rise to deeply ideological and, at times, almost religious debates.

Solana has been the subject of substantial criticism and misinformation from a vocal subset of the blockchain community regarding a perceived lack of decentralization and censorship resistance. A recent example being former American intelligence contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, who voiced concerns during a [**Token2049**](https://youtu.be/XD-XU6Y3TfA?si=E1IaejuCECQsIpjd&t=991) conference keynote presentation.

*“When you look back at the Bitcoin whitepaper, I think what you see is an adversarial approach to the system and that’s really what you have to be considering. A lot of people, and I don’t want to name names but,* ***Solana****, are taking good ideas and going, well, what if we just centralized everything? It will be faster, it will be more efficient, it’ll be cheaper… You have to be thinking for the adversarial case as opposed to the convenient, easy early case.”*

As with many of Solana’s critics, Snowden offered no data to substantiate his statements despite being [**publicly invited**](https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1841424790407520580) to do so. In the following sections of this work, we’ll analyze the decentralization of the Solana network through data, highlighting areas where the network demonstrates relatively strong decentralization while identifying areas where further progress is needed.

### Dimensions of Decentralization

With this report, we will take a quantitative and multifaceted approach to analyzing Solana’s decentralization, basing our analysis on facts and publicly verifiable information. 

We will assess the following areas:

* Distribution of stake
* Geographical distribution of nodes
* Diversity of hosting providers
* Client software diversity
* Developer diversity
* Governance processes and entities

‍When appropriate, we will compare Solana network’s metrics to those of other industry peer proof-of-stake L1 blockchains. Peer networks serve only as benchmarks, providing a broader context for Solana’s decentralization journey and highlighting areas where it may lag or outperform expectations.

‍**These comparisons should not be misconstrued as attempts to claim one network’s superiority over another.**

‍In many cases, Ethereum provides the most helpful benchmark as it is widely considered the most decentralized Layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain. It is worth noting that Ethereum is more than twice as old as Solana, with its genesis block produced in July 2015, compared to Solana’s in March 2020. Decentralization is dynamic, and blockchains typically become more decentralized over time. Given similar conditions, it’s reasonable to expect older networks to achieve higher levels of decentralization.

## Distribution of Stake

Stake distribution in a blockchain network refers to how the network’s staked tokens are allocated among its validators. In a well-distributed system, no single validator or small group holds a disproportionately large stake, reducing the risk of any one entity gaining undue influence or control over network consensus. 

‍A balanced stake distribution promotes decentralization by ensuring a diverse set of validators, making it harder for any malicious actor to compromise the network’s integrity. It also contributes to greater fault tolerance as the network becomes more resilient to individual validator failures.

‍*“You need a very large validator set, the larger it is on a gut level the network is more secure, but on the academic level, the bigger the set of nodes the easier it is to guarantee that honest nodes as a minority of that set always have a minimum spanning tree that can reach each other. That doesn’t even mean at the protocol layer; it’s literally people talking on the phone. The fact that people can get into Discord or IRC or call each other on a cell phone. That is us resolving a partition and figuring out what’s wrong. The more people we have, the easier it is for us to guarantee that partitions are impossible.”*

\- Anatoly Yakovenko, [**Breakpoint 2024**](https://youtu.be/wQNNsaFHnb0?si=n8Hc1gLQWtLWHZDf&t=578)

‍[**Running a node on the Solana network**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/how-to-set-up-a-solana-validator) is entirely permissionless, with a very low mandatory minimum stake (1 SOL) required to operate as a validator. The network natively supports [**delegated proof-of-stake**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/how-to-stake-solana) (dPoS) and consists of 4,514 nodes, including 1,414 validators and 3,100 RPC nodes. 

‍The largest two validators by stake are operated by Helius and Galaxy, each holding roughly 3.2%. The minimum delegated stake required to enter the top one-third superminority and top two-thirds supermajority is 4.4 million and 1.23 million SOL, respectively.

[ Above: validators ordered by stake, logarithmic scale ](https://preview.redd.it/znqncxt0q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=505bad9eb8fa1501602ed6b3fbceef1c554f21f4)

The chart below groups validators by delegated stake for added clarity. At the upper end, 82 validators (5.87% of the total) hold over one million delegated SOL. Conversely, on the lower end, 825 validators (59.1% of the total) have under 50,000 delegated SOL, with most participating in the Solana Foundation Delegation Program (SFDP), a program designed to help fast-track smaller validators to sustainability. Approximately 72% of Solana validators benefit from SFDP support, and these validators collectively represent 19% of the total stake. For an in-depth exploration of SFDP, please refer to our earlier Helius report: [**SFDP & the Challenges Facing Long-tail Validators**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-foundation-delegation-program-sfdp).

[ Above: Solana validators grouped by stake ](https://preview.redd.it/qcr3xlv2q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab007c98518c987e5655ce44b0e72f55246e509c)

Just as blockchain addresses do not equate to users, the validator count does not reflect the true number of distinct entities operating validators. The true number is lower as larger entities may chose to distribute their stake across multiple validators. For instance, Jito ([**1**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/J1to1yufRnoWn81KYg1XkTWzmKjnYSnmE2VY8DGUJ9Qv), [**2**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/J1to2NAwajc8hD6E6kujdQiPn1Bbt2mGKKZLY9kSQKdB)), Coinbase ([**1**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/beefKGBWeSpHzYBHZXwp5So7wdQGX6mu4ZHCsH3uTar), [**2**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/6D2jqw9hyVCpppZexquxa74Fn33rJzzBx38T58VucHx9)), and Mrgn ([**1**](https://stakewiz.com/validator/mrgn6ETrBDM8mjjYN8rbVwFqVwF8z6rtmvGLbdGuVUU), [**2**](https://stakewiz.com/validator/mrgn4t2JabSgvGnrCaHXMvz8ocr4F52scsxJnkQMQsQ)) operate several validators. 

‍There is no inherent issue with a single entity operating multiple validators; in fact, this could strengthen the network by increasing geographical and hosting provider diversity, provided the validators are distributed rather than collocated. However, risks may arise if these validators are configured identically with non-standard settings or firewall rules. Additionally, having numerous validators managed by a single entity on behalf of large companies or projects as part of a “validator-as-a-service” model could present further decentralization concerns.

### Nakamoto Coefficient

In proof-of-stake networks, the [**Nakamoto Coefficient**](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e) represents the minimum number of nodes required to control at least one-third of the total stake (i.e., the superminority). A higher Nakamoto Coefficient indicates a broader distribution of stake and, consequently, a higher level of decentralization. It can also be considered the smallest number of independent entities that can maliciously conspire to cause a liveness failure, denying the consensus needed for new block production. PoS and Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based blockchains require more than two-thirds of the stake to agree on the state of the network to continue transaction processing.

‍To determine the Solana network’s Nakamoto Coefficient, we rank validators from highest to lowest by their stake share and count the number required to control one-third of the total stake. Solana’s Nakamoto Coefficient has historically ranged between a peak of 34 on August 13, 2023, and a low of 19, where it currently stands. The coefficient has been relatively stable for the past year.

[ Above: Solana’s historical Nakamoto Coefficient ](https://preview.redd.it/31kncc25q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf0deaa9ba73aa911b15279f41c10038e6e0a992)

The Solana network's Nakamoto Coefficient ranks in the middle compared to industry peer networks. These numbers do not consider that individual entities are free to permissionlessly operate multiple validators anonymously, so the true Nakamoto Coefficients are likely lower.

[ Above: comparison of Nakamoto coefficients between various L1 blockchains ](https://preview.redd.it/qfsuk5s6q31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6459be3ebdb729e1c062bc6d18f6c0a45cda442)

## Geographical Distribution of Validators and Stake

The geographical diversity of network nodes is essential for reducing risk and promoting network antifragility. When too many validators are concentrated in a single region, the network’s resilience becomes reliant on the regulatory frameworks of those specific jurisdictions.

‍Natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and tsunamis, pose another risk. Such events strain national power grids and can severely disrupt data center operations, leading to abrupt outages. Manmade threats, such as war, cyberattacks, and damage to critical internet infrastructure, including undersea cables, pose further risks that could endanger network stability.

‍Solana data for this section’s analysis was gathered from validators.app for epoch 685. The raw dataset is available in spreadsheet format [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DXVqbYuAF4I34Jp8QrSKVl0dyWzws3t3apZOZ_Vgkf0/edit?usp=sharing). These numbers reflect only staked validator nodes and do not include non-staked RPC nodes.

### Solana Validator Count and Stake by Continent

When grouped by continent, the data shows that 632 Solana validators (46%) are based in Europe, with 550 (40%) in North America. In terms of stake distribution, 68% of stake is delegated to validators in Europe, with 20% delegated to those in North America. 50.5% of all stake is delegated to validators operating within the European Union (i.e., European stake excluding Norway, Ukraine, and the UK).

*Above: Solana validator and stake distribution by continent (map design:* [*FreePik*](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/worldwide-global-map-outline-black-background_68624434.htm)*)*

Comparatively, Ethereum has a similar distribution of stake with higher weighting towards North America at 34.4%.

### Solana Validator Count by Country

The Solana network's validator set spans 37 different countries and territories. The largest concentration is in America, with 508 validators (37%) operating from U.S. data centers, followed by 112 validators (8%) in the Netherlands and 111 validators (8%) in Russia.

[ Above: Solana validator count by country, epoch 685 ](https://preview.redd.it/9uq8pz5rq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0bbb4d36682c45b47631e0917e6afbe1420984b)

#  Geographical Distribution of Solana by Stake

This distribution is more balanced when weighing the validator set by stake. Four key jurisdictions each hold over 10% of stake: the US with 18.3%, followed by the Netherlands and the UK, both at 13.7%, and Germany with 13.2%.

[ Above: Geographical distribution of Solana stake \(epoch 685\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ydis03ftq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c19a676eaf0914e66a3505d8d32418b2fe40df3)

By comparison, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 83 different countries and territories, with almost half located in the US or Germany.

https://preview.redd.it/o0psj2bvq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd0f448f3b6c42f4b4a3029158da110b24992c9

*Above: Ethereum nodes by country (*[***source***](https://nodewatch.io/)*)*

### Top 10 Cities by Solana Node Count and Stake

A more granular analysis of validator and delegated stake distribution by city shows Solana validators are distributed across 121 cities worldwide. 

Specifically, for the United States, validators are dispersed across all major regions, encompassing 35 cities in total. The most popular are Chicago (124 validators, 2.3% of stake), Los Angeles (57 validators, 2.3% of stake), and New York (32 validators, 3.5% of stake).

https://preview.redd.it/dl2hwpfyq31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8152a82db967693417dde68538d17b58685e0b13

 Earlier this year, Anza staff [**Rex St.John**](https://x.com/rexstjohn/status/1793744241207955735) proposed strategies to improve the geographic diversity of Solana’s validators, notably by expanding the presence of operators in the global South.

‍Several key challenges were identified:

‍**Higher latency:** nodes in remote regions face difficulty staying synchronized with the network.

* **Bandwidth cost:** some regions are notable for having a very high cost of bandwidth
* **Regulatory restrictions:** various jurisdictions impose laws that limit the feasibility of operating blockchain infrastructure
* **Underdeveloped infrastructure:** Insufficient network and data center infrastructure.
* **Unfavorable tax and tariffs:** high costs on hardware equipment.
* **Talent shortage:** a lack of local expertise in Solana and limited access to the capital required for staking

## Hosting Providers

The validator set should ideally be hosted across a broad spectrum of independent providers rather than relying heavily on a few centralized ones. This diversification is essential to reducing the risk of network disruptions or censorship from any single provider.

‍A notable incident in 2022 involved the German hosting provider Hetzner, which unexpectedly removed Solana validators from its services, taking over 20% of the active stake — around 1,000 validators — offline within hours. Despite this, *Solana remained fully operational without liveness issues*. Most impacted validators successfully migrated to new data centers within days, and nearly all delinquent stake was [**back online within a few weeks**](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-march-2023).

[Above: the email notification sent to Hetzner customers instructing them to remove Solana client software from their servers](https://preview.redd.it/89t1d7s0r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7425e9fbe9acbe5867fc653a6d6dd35b107e4a81)

#  Solana Validator Hosting Providers by Stake

The Solana validator set is dispersed across 135 different hosting providers. The two leading providers are **Teraswitch**, a privately owned U.S. company, hosting 24% of validators, and **Latitude.sh** (formerly Maxihost), a Brazilian-based provider of low-cost bare metal servers used by 19% of validators. These two providers combined account for 43.4% of stake. 

‍Other popular hosts include the French cloud computing company **OVHcloud**, with an 8.65% share, and Lithuanian-based **Cherry Servers**, hosting 8.45% of validators.

[Above: validator hosting providers by stake](https://preview.redd.it/oz1spqm3r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=231b398b355ec3b4d2646fb37f97ba8c81049de7)

### Solana Validator Hardware Requirements

Because Solana is a high-performance, high-throughput blockchain, it has more demanding [**node requirements**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-nodes-a-primer-on-solana-rpcs-validators-and-rpc-providers#solana-node-requirements) than most industry peers. Hardware recommendations for Solana validators include the following key components:

‍**CPU:** 24 cores / 48 threads, or more, 4.2GHz base clock speed, or faster 

* **Memory:** 512 GB
* **Disk:** PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better, 2 TB combined or larger. High TBW
* No GPU requirement

‍In practice, Solana’s bandwidth requirements make home operations impractical, so validators are predominantly operated from bare metal servers in dedicated data centers. 

## Solana Client Diversity

Solana initially launched with a single validator client, developed by Solana Labs and written in Rust. While the Solana Labs client is no longer actively updated, a fork known as [**Agave**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/agave-2-0-transition) is currently in active use. Relying entirely on a single client implementation is a significant vector of centralization because it poses the risk of a critical software bug that could cause a liveness failure across the entire network. 

‍Increasing client diversity has been a top priority for the Solana community, and this goal is now finally being realized with the rollout of [**Firedancer**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer).

### Solana Client Implementations

Today, multiple Solana client implementations are either operational or in development:

* [**Agave**](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave): a fork of the original Solana Labs client, written in Rust and maintained by Solana software development firm [**Anza**](https://www.anza.xyz/#validator).
* [**Firedancer**](https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer): a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language maintained by [**Jump Crypto**](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/).
* [**Frankendancer**](https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer): a hybrid validator combining the networking stack and block production components of Firedancer with the execution and consensus of Agave.
* [**Jito**](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-solana): an Agave client fork built by [**Jito Labs**](https://jito-foundation.gitbook.io/mev/jito-solana/building-the-software) that introduces an out-of-protocol block space auction, providing validators with more economic incentives through tips.
* [**Sig**](https://github.com/Syndica/sig): a reads-optimized Solana validator client written in Zig by [**Syndica**](https://syndica.io/sig).

‍Additionally, [**Mithril**](https://github.com/Overclock-Validator/mithril) is a client written in Golang and developed by [**Overclock**](https://overclock.one/rnd/unveiling-mithril) to serve as a verifying full node with lower hardware requirements.

‍Having multiple full-time core engineering teams reviewing each other's codebases significantly boosts the likelihood of catching bugs while promoting knowledge sharing and collaboration.

‍*“We've learned a lot from the Firedancer client team; there are things that they've come up with that have been really clever solutions,”* noted Anza engineer Joe Caulfield in a [**recent interview**](https://youtu.be/dgqQHEbTdPA?si=j5FgYl4ChQGhUOiS&t=899).

‍Both Agave and Firedancer have significant [**bug bounty programs**](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/firedancer/information/).

### Solana Client Diversity vs. Ethereum

Solana and Ethereum are the only Layer 1 networks offering multiple client implementations. Ethereum has at least five major software clients. The most widely adopted are [**Nethermind**](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind), written in C#, with 45% usage, and [**Geth**](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), written in Go, with 39% adoption. 

‍On Solana, the Jito client currently has an 88% share of the network's stake. However, this landscape is expected to change considerably over the next twelve months as new clients — Frankendancer and Firedancer — are gradually introduced and integrated into the ecosystem.

[Above: Solana and Ethereum client diversity \(October 2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/0mqgij67r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8ee7eae4c46baf66815ded10fceb0e03383115e)

## Developer Decentralization

In *Quantifying Decentralization*, Balaji identifies developer decentralization as a critical factor for blockchain ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of minimizing reliance on individual contributors and reducing “key person risk.”

‍All core client software on Solana is hosted publicly on GitHub under open-source licenses, allowing for open access and community contributions. 

‍The Agave validator, maintained by Anza — a software development firm [**established**](https://medium.com/anza-xyz/meet-anza-a-new-solana-focused-dev-shop-7d92391d290b) in early 2024 — plays a prominent role in this landscape. Anza was founded with around 45 employees, roughly half of the team previously employed by Solana Labs. 

‍In addition to managing Agave, the Anza team contributes to the broader Solana ecosystem by developing initiatives such as [**token extensions**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/plug-and-play-token-extensions), cross-border payments infrastructure, and [**Solana Permissioned Environments**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/evaluating-solana-for-enterprise-use-a-comprehensive-guide#solana-permissioned-environments).

### Number of Agave Client Codebase Contributors

The Agave client codebase has 357 contributors and 26,408 commits, though raw commit counts alone are imperfect and do not fully capture the depth of individual contributions. Notably, a relatively small group of developers — primarily senior engineers and co-founders of Solana — have authored the majority of commits, with a long tail of smaller contributors.

[Above: commits to the Solana Agave client codebase by contributor. Dependabot is a dependency tracking\/updating bot.](https://preview.redd.it/e8fuhgo9r31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08d4487798e8263f40b9f7fd8f215038704511c)

For comparison, Ethereum’s popular Geth and Nethermind clients demonstrate a similar pattern of contributor concentration within a larger community. Geth has 1,098 contributors, while Nethermind has 142. Over half of all commits to Geth are attributable to three core contributors. Likewise, two developers account for over 50% of all commits to Nethermind.

‍Number of Firedancer Client Codebase Contributors

The Firedancer client, developed by a small team under the leadership of [**Kevin Bowers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL_yJWI-kNI) at the prominent American high-frequency trading firm [**Jump**](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/), currently has 57 contributors and 3,722 commits. Contributor diversity remains limited given that Firedancer is a relatively new project — the first commit dates back to August 2022 — and became live on mainnet only recently.

[Above: commits to the Solana Agave client codebase by contributor.](https://preview.redd.it/ygjycv3cr31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab39d03615da71acb04b4d73a0726075a03db8a4)

### Solana Ecosystem Developers

Across the broader Solana ecosystem, there is strong evidence of geographical diversity among the developer community. Solana’s online bi-annual hackathons are some of the largest in the world by participation and play a large role in nurturing many of today’s most successful Solana protocols and applications teams, including Tensor, Drift, Jito, and Kamino. 

The most recent [**Radar hackathon**](https://www.colosseum.org/radar) drew 13,672 participants from 156 countries, with notable representation from India, Nigeria, the U.S., and Vietnam.

https://preview.redd.it/ny774q0fr31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4365122abd98f81c8d4876a3d24d5a581fa04935

Above: Radar hackathon registrations by country

 [**Superteam**](https://superteam.fun/), a network connecting Solana creatives, developers, and operators, has expanded to [**1,300 members**](https://x.com/afscott/status/1850481902584545791) in 16 countries. Its localized chapters facilitate collaboration through events and shared workspaces. [**Solana Allstars**](https://x.com/SolanaAllstars/status/1821235463018963079), an ambassador program run by Step Finance, has seen considerable success in Nigeria, running over 120 well-attended meetups across many regions

## Governance

Governance is an important vector for decentralization as it determines how decisions are made within the network. This impacts everything from protocol upgrades to economic policies and community rules. Decentralized governance strengthens transparency, fairness, and trust in the network.

### Governance Voting and SIMDs

Solana Improvement and Development (SIMD) proposals are the formal documentation necessary for any substantial change to Solana’s core components. ""Substantial"" changes are defined as those that typically alter the network protocol, transaction validity, or interoperability. 

‍Non-substantial changes, such as minor code refactoring or objective performance improvements, do not require proposals. Proposals should document the rationale for the feature and enough documentation to understand the implementation. 

‍While submitting SIMDs is permissionless and open to any developer or researcher, most are submitted by client team developers working full-time on core protocol improvements.

‍There are two types of proposals: 

* **Standard Proposals:** affect core Solana features (e.g., consensus, networking, and API interfaces)
* **Meta Proposals:** address processes or guidelines outside the codebase

### SIMD Process

SIMDs typically progress through idea vetting, drafting, review, and acceptance stages. A formal review occurs publicly on GitHub, with the proposal author being responsible for gathering feedback from relevant core contributors, who determine if it is accepted, revised, or withdrawn. 

‍Authors are not obligated to implement their proposals, but it is generally suggested they do so as the best way to ensure successful completion.

‍If accepted, proposals often include an associated tracking issue for feature implementation and may require activation through [**Solana’s feature-gate mechanism**](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/wiki/Feature-Gate-Activation-Schedule). Feature gates are activated on epoch boundaries first on Testnet, then Devnet, before Mainnet activation.

‍Discussions on improvements span the following venues:

* SIMD ([**Solana Improvement Document**](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents)) Github repository
* sRFC ([**Solana Request for Comments**](https://forum.solana.com/c/srfc/6)) section of the official Solana forums
* The [**Solana Tech Discord**](https://discord.gg/solana)
* Disperse social channels, including X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram

### Solana Governance Voting Process

Significant protocol-altering SIMDs, especially those affecting economic parameters, undergo governance votes. The Solana governance voting process, a relatively new initiative spearheaded by longstanding members of the validator community, focuses solely on critical issues to maintain engagement and avoid governance fatigue. 

‍So far, three such votes have taken place:

* [**Initial Advisory Vote**](https://forum.solana.com/t/vote-first-governance-advisory-vote-by-validators/597/5) in October 2023 (14.3% stake participation)
* SIMD33 [**Timely Vote Credits**](https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-timely-vote-credits-mechanism-on-solana-mainnet/1179/20) in April 2024 (53% stake participation)
* SIMD96 [**Full Priority Fee to Validators**](https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-reward-full-priority-fee-to-validator-on-solana-mainnet-beta/1456/97) in May 2024 (51% stake participation)

‍Voting occurs via tokens deposited into each validator’s identity account, with each account receiving tokens proportional to its active stake in lamports. 

‍To cast a vote, validators transfer these tokens to one of several designated public keys corresponding to the available voting options, including an option to abstain. Once a vote is cast, it cannot be changed. 

‍In this structure, SOL token holders participate only indirectly by delegating their staked SOL to validators whose voting choices align with their values or preferences.

### Governance Benchmarking

According to a benchmarking report by [**CCData**](https://ccdata.io/research/esg-report-february-2024) released earlier this year, Solana is one of only four AA-graded assets among the top 40 digital assets evaluated for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards. The report's governance ratings, in which Solana was ranked fourth among L1 blockchains, assess factors including stakeholder participation, transparency, and the degree of decentralization.

https://preview.redd.it/tifu8s8jr31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5db9885dfdf1d03ca0891bc7ad76b4545390d648

*Above: Digital asset ESG benchmark governance ratings for L1 blockchains (*[***source***](https://ccdata.io/research/esg-report-february-2024)*)*

### The Solana Foundation

The [**Solana Foundation**](https://solana.org/) (SF), established in June 2019, is a Swiss-registered non-profit organization dedicated to decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana ecosystem. With an initial treasury of 167 million SOL tokens, SF oversees [**funding for grants**](https://solana.org/grants-funding), its [**Delegation Program**](https://solana.org/delegation-program), and developer tools. It controls official brand assets, social media accounts, websites, and trademarks.

‍The Foundation operates with a relatively lean team of 60-65 full-time employees under the leadership of **Executive Director Daniel Albert** and **President Lily Liu,** supervised by the [**Foundation board**](https://zg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-436.843.713).

‍SF’s mission is to cultivate a scalable and self-sustaining Solana network, focusing on education, research, and ecosystem development initiatives. SF organizes large-scale Solana [**events**](https://solana.com/events), including [**Hacker Houses**](https://solana.com/news/2024-solana-hacker-houses-schedule) and the annual [**Breakpoint conference**](https://solana.com/breakpoint), to foster developer engagement and community building. 

‍The SF developer relations team maintains official documentation, social channels, and developer education. In January 2024, SF transitioned the management of the flagship hackathons to [**Colosseum**](https://www.colosseum.org/about/), a new independent accelerator co-founded by former SF Head of Growth [**Matty Taylor**](https://x.com/mattytay?lang=en).

‍*“Our job is to work ourselves out of a job. Find scalable ways to support the network and ecosystem and then get out of their way,”* noted Dan Albert at a [**recent debate**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri6d7FowWlg&list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&index=125), signaling SF’s long-term aim to establish a network that can sustain itself without oversight. 

## Conclusion

As outlined in this work, the Solana network’s decentralization is comparable to or exceeds that of its industry peers across numerous key metrics, including the Nakamoto Coefficient, geographical distribution of validators and stake, developer decentralization, and governance benchmarks. Client diversity remains a notable exception, which the new Firedancer client aims to address.

‍Several opportunities exist to enhance Solana's decentralization:

* Explore options to distribute the SF’s responsibilities across multiple organizations
* Increase transparency around Foundation spending and grant allocations
* Develop initiatives, such as ‘[**Solana Nations**](https://x.com/rexstjohn/status/1793744241207955735),’ to increase geographic diversity
* Reduce voting costs, which are the most significant [**expense for validator operators**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-validator-economics-a-primer)
* Explore strategies to reduce data egress demands on validators; these costs are notably high for operators outside the EU and US
* Encourage more active participation in governance voting
* Expand Solana's core contributor and research communities to strengthen the network's development

‍The validator set remains somewhat concentrated in the U.S. and EU and reliant on a limited number of hosting providers. While this challenge is not unique to Solana, it highlights the potential for Solana to improve as one of the less centralized blockchains on the validator level.

I get it, not everyone wants to gamble their money on random funny (or not) memes.

So here are 2 alternative ways of profiting from memecoins:

First way: DLMM Farming

I know, this sounds like some pro-level DeFi genius-only thing. But it’s not. 

What you have to do is simply provide liquidity for memecoins on Meteora and you will earn fees from people trading it.

Here’s how:

1. Go to the DLMM tab on Meteora
2. Pick a Pair: Look for low TVL, high-volume pairs. Balance risk with potential rewards.
3. Go to Add Liquidity
4. Set a Range: More bins = less risk, lower fees.
5. Choose a Strategy:
• Spot: All-purpose, easy.
• Curve: For stable pairs.
• Bid-Ask: Great for volatility.
6. Deposit your liquidity and start earning fees

This is NFA, please learn more about Liquidity Pools and Impermanent Loss before depositing.

Second way: Memecoin Branding Studio

Memecoins thrive on social media content, and that’s where the magic happens.

I’ve cornered Matt, founder of XD Studio—the genius behind viral content for top memecoins—and got him to spill the tea on how much you can earn creating art for memecoins.

Here’s what he shared (after a little persuasion):

Most deals are monthly, but individual prices are: 

• Animated GIFs - $100+, Art - $100-$200+.
• 50+ brands signed this year
• High 6-figure annual revenue

This business model is nearly perfect: it has little downside risk but a high upside potential.

Crypto companies typically pay more than other industries, allowing you to have way higher margins.

Hope this was useful.

I'm trying to deepen my understanding of liquidity models on Raydium, specifically the differences between *Concentrated Liquidity*, *Standard AMM*, and *Legacy AMM 4*.



My main question is: How do these differences impact token purchases?

Reddit,solana,Solana / Validated Podcast - The Politics of Bits: What the U.S. Election Means for Crypto w/ Sheila Warren,2024-11-15 13:30:08,,2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350
Reddit,solana,Beware of This New Solana drain hack,2024-11-14 12:15:36,"⚠️ ATTENTION CRYPTO COMMUNITY & DEVELOPERS ⚠️

I just got drained on my main wallet. I need to share the story of this scam aimed at developers. 

I have been in crypto since 2016 and I have always been a relatively cautionary user. New scams are evolving rapidly. 

I was approached on LinkedIn for a web3 role as a backend developer. As a passionate junior web developer and crypto enthusiast looking for an initial role, I was very much intrigued. Here's how the scam unfolded:

• Initial Contact: The scammer reached out on LinkedIn and we started discussing a potential role in web3. They seemed credible at first, with a professional profile. 

• Code Test Requirement: They asked me to do a coding test by adding an API route to their Bitbucket repo. This was my first red flag, but my noob junior dev eagerness clouded my judgment. I jumped straight onto coding 🤦🏻‍♂️

• Malicious Code: I proceeded with the npm install command to be able to console log the server route working as instructed but the repo probably contained malicious npm packages and I did not pay attention then.

• Fake Interview: During what I thought was an interview, they asked me to connect my wallet to a site they were developing. I still knew it could be a scam, so i made him wait while I created a new chrome guest account to create a new metamask wallet from a new seed. Thinking in the worse case it would only drain an empty wallet, I used the guest account to proceed and click connect...

• Theft: Within an hour, funds started moving from my main metamask account and other sub-accounts. I immediately jumped on my pc to try to save what was being stolen, but could mainly only save around $2k.

• Despite my precautions, I lost around $5k, a significant part of my portfolio which I had been building since 2016. 🥲

• The scammer couldn't steal the funds I had staked with @Karak_Network as it takes 1 week to unstake. I have started the unstaking process today and would like to see if the Karak team would be able to do something here. If anyone else knows a way or solution to this problem, I would love to hear them 🙏

• The scammer couldn't neither sell my $cbBTC staked on @SolvProtocol as the redemptions are closed, but I fear that he might do it as soon as redemptions are available again. In this sense, would it be possible to do something to secure those funds ? Or else, id rather have you blacklist that address so the scammer can never withdraw them neither.

I know most of you will probably say that I am stupid, and you wont be too wrong.. 

I deeply regret how stupid I was and how easily I lowered my guard despite the many red flags my mind refused to pay attention to 🤦🏻‍♂️

 ⚠️ Red Flags 

• New web3 DEX company looking for a junior web dev
• Contact person making basic English mistakes, despite his supposedly professional profile and background
• Having to npm install a random bitbucket repo
• Interviewer not showing his face during the interview
• Asking me to click connect on his supposedly dev website
• Weird LinkedIn username in profile URL

Key Lessons & Advice:

• Verify Everything: Always check the legitimacy of job offers. Use tools or professional networks to verify the person's identity.

• Beware of Code Tests: Never execute code from unknown sources without thorough review, especially if it involves running scripts or installing packages.

• Secure Your Wallets: Even if using a new wallet for testing, ensure your main accounts are secured on hardware wallet and never disclose sensitive information or connect to unknown sites.

• Stay Vigilant: If something feels off, trust your instincts. Scammers are getting better at creating believable scenarios.

I'm sharing this story now, because I believe it could happen to anyone and miss-attention can happen very quickly.

I know I have been too gullible, and too dumb to think a dev job process happens like this but again my animosity to work as developer got the best of me. 

I can only have myself to blame for that.

I'm not asking for help but would rather hope this message can remind everyone to stay super safe during this upcoming bull, scammers are always lurking in the dark, imagining new creative ways to get your crypto. 

A retweet would help get @solvprotocol and @Karak_Network 's attention so they can examine the case and see if they can take actions to secure the funds.

Finally, if anyone is willing to help look into this case, I'm sharing the transactions that drained my wallet so we can try to have the scammer's address blacklisted:
 
- Primary Drained Wallet Address: debank.com/profile/0xea1b… 
- 2ndary Drained Wallet Address: debank.com/profile/0x0903…

- Scammer LinkedIn Account: linkedin.com/in/resourcefre…
- Scammer Account 1 (ETH): etherscan.io/address/0x7724… 
- Scammer Account 2 (RONIN) : app.roninchain.com/address/0xba02…
- Scammer BitBucket malicious repo: bitbucket.org/techreforms/lu…

- Proprietary Safe Account 1 (ETH): 0x563278BE365D7937Df813F1d171178AEaEc61931 (used to send the funds I could save and salvage during the hack)
- Proprietary  Safe Accounnt 2 (RONIN): 0xa8c182241Aa33bd6143cF5be7B0897Ef258b0C2d (used to send the funds I could save and salvage during the hack)

This experience was a harsh lesson, but my goal in sharing this is to prevent others from falling into similar traps. Let's keep the community safe by being cautious and sharing knowledge.

If anyone is willing to help spread the word so that everyone can be aware and careful about this type of drain hack, here's the Twitter post I wrote yesterday following the hack: https://x.com/GetMoustachu/status/1856899025615614365?t=K-JaWl0tvMOHoKNZ8KoDYQ&s=19

Reddit,solana, Got Scammed Using TrojanBot on Telegram,2024-11-15 18:15:12,"So, I was trying to connect to a server on Telegram that seemed legit. As part of the process, they asked me to verify that I was human by scanning a QR code using the Telegram app on my mobile device. Thinking it was normal, I scanned it without much thought.

The moment I scanned it, **everything in my account was drained** and sent to this wallet: `6Tt49Ww423YifiwbHzBR2rt7TjyanyTWmQtRbxfbAmEb`. I was using TrojanBot at the time, and I believe that's how they exploited me.

I feel so stupid for falling for it, but I also want to make sure no one else makes the same mistake. Be careful with anything that asks you to scan QR codes, especially linked to wallets or bots.

If anyone has tips on what I can do next or if there’s any way to recover my funds, please let me know. Thanks in advance.

Anyway, my question is, instead of doing that, is it better to just buy Solana and trade the same amount of the coin I was going to swap in my wallet on Dexscreener? Is this a better way to get in and out of a coin faster or is it not the same gains as holding a coin in my wallet? I hope this made sense.

But if you dig into the details—bubble maps, wallet distribution, transaction history, etc., etc.—you’ve got a way better shot.

Given the way the market’s been lately, it feels easier to make profits than it was a few months back. It’s one thing to look like a genius in a bull run, but if you've been consistently profiting for close to 18 months, you know you’re onto something solid.

Don’t just gamble. Do the research—it takes time, sure, but it’s better than losing money. And like always, have fucking fun.

Reddit,solana,Bullx hidden fees: Taking a fix amount on every tx on top of the 0.9% they advertised.,2024-11-14 11:58:55,"I am done some researches.

>**I know what token account creations are**.

Bullx users are transfering a constant 0.002 SOL amount to the same address (**4o9p5PaYQcfNiLZCCN5ZsZckdtj6Up3xzLvSoZx8GufA**) on every tx they made, no matter the order settings they set. Some time it is 0.001 SOL, can't figure out why.

This wallet address (**4o9p5P...x8GufA**), makes thousands of SOL, and then swap it to millions of USDC, to be sent to other wallets.

If you are Bullxx user, you should be able to confirm that by checking any buy or sell transaction on solscan and display the legacy mode.

It might be a fee way to prioritise transaction, but if that is the case, they should document it and be more transparent about it. At the very least they should give this wallet a public name like pump fun does for their ""**Pump.fun Fee Account**"".

[Check last line](https://preview.redd.it/0e6rer0cvu0e1.png?width=2046&format=png&auto=webp&s=250b29457ca49219c78610789448cb356cc4fdc8)

\---

For those are still tempted to answer that it is the token account creation rent, here is a visualisation of how the token account works:

**Create token account with rent (\~0.002 SOL)** → **Receive tokens or use them (transfer)** → **(Optional) Burn tokens** → **Close token account to recover rent (\~0.002 SOL)**

You open a token account, which you own, then all the related token transfers are made with this account. Whenever you feel like it, you can burn the tokens and close the account to redeem the rent.

\---

If you have an other theory than me on those transfers, please provide source and/or proofs.

# EDIT:

I think I know what this is.  
Bullx used to use BloXroute like some other exchanges. So 0.001 SOL for every transaction.  
They most likely created their own BDN to cut out the middleman (around August 2024).  
The thing is that I can't find any trace of this online. If there is none again this lacks transparency.

For around 2 month they charged 0.001 for every transactions, and 0.002 since 30-40 days.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,ethereum,Non-Crypto Trader with a question,2024-11-08 22:43:30,"I am not a crypto trader. I do have a friend who is, though it's not a close acquaintance. They said if I wanted to try, I could download trust wallet, coinbase wallet, then send them my Ethereum address from in Coinbase wallet, fund my account through Trust Wallet, and they would use my Ethereum address to ""synchronize"" our accounts so that whatever trades they made, I would make automatically with whatever money I wanted to put in. (Say, 500 bucks for instance).

To me, this sounds extremely shady. They aren't explaining how they would sync our accounts, what method/program they use, etc. However, the average online search says sending someone an Ethereum address is generally safe. I just don't see how they could use that sole information to do what they're saying. If so, by what method?

I initially saw this as a harmless way to have a glimpse into what trading in crypto is like. But now I'm starting to feel as if there is a method of phishing/scamming of which I'm not aware, and I don't want anyone with access to my personal/financial information for obvious reasons.

If someone could explain to me how this works in layman's terms (ELI5) or whether this is a setup to grift money and/or personal info, I'd appreciate it! They're very annoyed by all my questions, which is part of why I'm so skeptical. Seems like there would be no reason to hide what they're doing or how if it was safe and legitimate.

Anyway, let me know what I'm missing, if anything. Or confirm what my gut says -- that this isn't a real thing, and someone is trying to see if they found a new mark.

EDIT: Thanks for the helpful (and expected) responses!  Like I said, I was never planning on getting into crypto regardless. Just not my bag, personally. I just wanted to learn about it, the equivalent of bringing $50 to Vegas but otherwise just seeing the sights. I appreciate the responses, because I have a more coherent way to say ""nah"" without making the overall social situation as awkward if anyone asks why I pissed this individual off.

Reddit,ethereum,I just realized a 2% validator effectiveness gap is costing me 0.1 ETH per year! (Math inside) 🤯,2024-11-07 15:47:14,"https://preview.redd.it/rjfk226r2izd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bd110d414df60e36f35f747241df88fa904fd3

TL;DR:

* Just analyzed Lido's validator data and found something crazy
* 99.4% vs 97.5% effectiveness = \~0.1 ETH difference per year (32 ETH stake)
* Not just simple math - rewards actually compound through multiple mechanisms
* Finally understand why DVT validators consistently earn more 🎯

Yo! 👋 Fellow ETH stakers,

Been going down a rabbit hole analyzing validator data (because that's what we do on Sunday nights, right? 😅). Found some mind-blowing stuff about how effectiveness REALLY impacts rewards.

The nerdy stuff first (I promise it gets interesting):

Basic staking math:

    Max theoretical APY = [base reward/epoch * epochs/year * 32 attestations] + block proposals
    = (4*10^-7 * 82,125 * 32) + ~0.5%
    ≈ 4.2%

But here's where it gets spicy 🌶️

Real rewards are affected by:

* Attestations (the bread & butter, \~95% of rewards)
* Block proposals (the juicy 5%)
* Sync committee rewards
* MEV (the cherry on top)

Looking at actual data from Lido's SimpleDVT validators:

* DVT validators: 99.4% effectiveness → 4.06% APY
* Average validators: 97.52% effectiveness → 3.74% APY

""But wait,"" I hear you say, ""that's just a 1.88% difference!""

NOPE. Here's the real impact on 32 ETH:

* 3.74% = 1.197 ETH/year
* 4.06% = 1.299 ETH/year
* Difference = 0.102 ETH 🤑

Why such a big difference? Because when you miss attestations:

1. You lose the base reward
2. Get slapped with penalties
3. Miss sync committee opportunities
4. Network delays snowball

The most interesting part? This data is from SSV-powered validators on Lido. Turns out distributed validation isn't just fancy tech - it's actually putting more ETH in people's wallets.

I mined eth for a while back in 2018 and 2019. Joined a pool and mined to an acct I setup locally with geth. Later switched to nicehash. Transferred some of my eth out to a coinbase account but still have approx 1.8 eth in there and haven't done anything at all with the acct since well before the switch to POS. Fired up geth a couple days ago to finally transfer my eth and realized of course my old geth couldn't connect to the network any longer and downloading a new version gives the error: ""Failed to register the Ethereum service: ethash is only supported as a historical component of already merged networks""

Ok so then it dawned on me.. I won't be connecting to the block chain directly like I did previously since I can't stake. What's the easiest way to transfer my eth now? Can I still locally connect to the network to submit a transaction even without mining or do I need to use some other service?

The goal is fairly simple: to make it possible for anyone to have full control of their hardware wallets. Lots of beneficial products could come from this; for example, in gaming arcades, hardware wallets could provide you with identity.

One of the problems with Ledger is that they are closed source, and as we found out not long ago—not really ""our"" keys, as they can export them (no thank you).

If anyone has any knowledge on this, I'd really appreciate it, and if anyone wants to work on this with me to achieve such hardware, that would be amazing too! I run a Web3 company and am a developer myself, and can provide funding as well.

Reddit,ethereum,Market risk of a 51% attack on Polymarket,2024-11-02 22:18:06,"Over the past few days, I did a deep dive into Polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. Here’s what I’ve found:

UMA is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'Trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'Optimistic Oracle'. An 'Asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved ERC20 token) alongside the assertion. Anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'Disputer') may do so, typically by matching the Asserter's stake. If a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'Data Verification Mechanism' (DVM). When it reaches DVM, the tokenholders of UMA decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the Asserter or the Disputer receives the staked currencies). They do this with one vote per UMA token.

Polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with UMA. The API allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. The Polymarket API also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. If there is a dispute, it gets escalated to UMA's DVM system. Disputes rarely happen because the DVM works. Typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. This clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down.

However, the market cap of UMA is only about $200m as of writing this post. A 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. It is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of UMA could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on Polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the DVM for each of them, and win every bet. Doing this would destroy their $100m of UMA, but they'll potentially make more from the bets.

A quick browse of Polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). It's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on Polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. But a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""Presidential Election Winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ):

* Buy ""Yes"" on Chris Christie. $0.001. Buy 72 million shares right now for $72k.
* Buy ""No"" on Trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m
* Buy ""No"" on Kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m
* Accept the loss of $100m worth of UMA due to the price collapsing

**This would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** They could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. There's only about $670m of USDC on the Polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts.

At the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that Chris Christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on UMA.

There is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack UMA, and that would be to gain favor with Trump by using their 51% to decide Trump wins on the betting markets. It could be used to help the publicity battle that Trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election.

I would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on UMA, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). If anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. I'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%.

So, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. If UMA's market cap doesn't rise as fast as Polymarket's betting markets, Polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum monthly dashboard,2024-11-01 15:27:19,"October has been a steady month for Ethereum staking, ending with over **34.4 million ETH** staked and **4,9k validators** currently in the entry queue.

While this month hasn't introduced significant changes in staking metrics, there's plenty of exciting work underway for Ethereum's future development. Preparations for Pectra are in full swing, and Vitalik Buterin has released thought-provoking posts on the potential futures of the Ethereum protocol.

Reddit,ethereum,18 days activation queue on Holesky?! Something big is brewing in ETH staking 🤔,2024-11-01 13:56:14,"https://preview.redd.it/kwfa1wk1payd1.png?width=2824&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf194f89d8043bde3deb46912a04e4eb4cbbaffb

Okay, this is weird. I just tried to set up a validator on Holesky testnet and noticed I'd have to wait 18 DAYS for activation. Double-checked the queue - there are [32,033 validators ](https://holesky.beaconcha.in)waiting. On a testnet! Something's definitely cooking...

What's even more interesting is that this massive queue started forming right after EIP-7002 (the beacon state root in the EVM proposal) hit the testnet. For those not familiar, this proposal essentially enables smart contracts to verify beacon chain state, which is crucial for many staking innovations.

Looking through some GitHub discussions and Discord channels, I've noticed a lot of activity around:

* DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) implementations
* Restaking protocols
* Liquid staking solutions
* New staking pool mechanisms

I'm particularly intrigued by the DVT testing activities because of the recent Lido simpleDVT and CSM discussions about implementing validator splitting into DVT solutions. Seeing projects like SSV and others actively testing on Holesky makes me wonder if we're closer to seeing production-ready DVT implementations than we think.

Anyone else noticed this unusual testnet activity? What do you think is being tested at such scale?",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350
Reddit,ethereum,Aggregation & atomization: dependency funding round dynamics,2024-11-01 18:28:23,"New article: Aggregation & atomization: dependency funding round dynamics

**>>>>>>>> read the** [**full piece**](https://trent.mirror.xyz/ia1sSXWw6Q_0gseWhPDpt0WbsOadCfQ-23yAxNn4sXA), summary below  
  
The term “public goods” has been diluted - “dependency” might be better. Round-based funding mechanisms incentivize atomization - how can we avoid this?

We have failed to develop standards of rigor for the use of the ""public goods"" term. When it applies to everything, it describes nothing. “Dependency” is better for the Ethereum software ecosystem: crucial bits of infrastructure not directly maintained by an actor.

Recurring Funding Rounds come with tradeoffs  
  
\- attention games  
\- eligibility scoping  
\- high expectations of evaluators  
\- atomization incentive

Reflecting on OP Retro Round 5  
  
\- incentivizing atomization  
\- Legibility is not impact  
\- Stewardship is less legible - for good reason  
\- Misconceptions about levels of PG funding

Possible modifications for rounds  
  
\- Remove caps on allocations

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,2024-10-31 14:25:40,"# Here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. 

**First a bit of context:**

I guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like MetaMask). So you don’t use crypto the way you’d use Cash App or Revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day.

But the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling YouTube, Instagram, or WhatsApp. So, if we want Ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. Plus most people in Asia and Africa are mobile-first. 

**Why do I even talk about it?**

So we've been building Kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. Our idea has been to stay open and Ethereum-aligned. This means that we haven’t set up “Sign in with Google” or embedded wallets powered by Privy, Capsule, and others. We haven’t even built an Android or Apple app - we have a PWA app so that everyone can use it.

Since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing Ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. But unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work.

I've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from Istanbul to LA and saw people getting onboarded to our app. They used Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask and many other wallets. 

Metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. Rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. Coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing.

And it’s not only Kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like Zora. Some just say: “Ah yeah, it’s normal. I will figure it out once I get in front of my laptop”. Can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances?

Last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753)

And it’s not that the Ethereum community doesn’t care about the UX. Vitalik even said at one of his talks: “We should be as decentralized and open as Linux and Android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as Apple.”

But if Steve Jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from AppStore forever.

Wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. You can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. But this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder.

And the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. But it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. And the whole idea is to have your ENS and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. 

The question is, why does it keep happening? Maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from Firefox, through Chrome up to Opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. But then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time?

If we had solved the Merge, I imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. But it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

It was something along the lines of keeping most of your wealth in BTC indefinitely instead of a savings account, and only converting to fiat if you need to pay a bill or go on vacation etc.

Then he said something like:

In Dollar terms the cost of the coffee beans he buys have become 45% more expensive in the last 5 years.

In BTC terms they are 85% cheaper than 5 years ago.

Reddit,bitcoin,Why I think that this Bullrun will be different,2024-11-16 15:14:59,"We can all agree about the value proposition that bitcoin provides. Some of us saw it earlier than others, but the world is starting to see it in new ways. We see Saylor’s Microstrategy, ETFs and Gov’t adoption as a strategic investment. One of the main complaints from Buttcoiners and the general public is that it is too easy to hack or lose your keys. And while any somewhat technically savvy individual could manage their own keys, it is probably more hassle than the average person wanted to subject themselves. With the introduction of ETFs, we have now opened the door to the investment community.  If I want to buy more bitcoin, I can just hop onto my brokerage account and buy all I want and sell for that matter. While some of you may cry “Not your keys!!”, the average person was only going to be convinced if it was offered via the same avenues as other investments. This is only the beginning of widespread adoption…it might look a tad bid different than some of us expected but it was one of the few ways widespread was feasible. The infusion of investment will be to a scale unlike any we have seen in the past.  Cheers brothers/sisters and good luck in your Hodling!

tldr widespread adoption of bitcoin as an investment  needed a familiar avenue to the lay person…we have that unlike any previous bullrun which is why we will rally as hard as we will.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin is my Retirement Bonus,2024-11-16 10:02:16,"I’m 15 years from retirement. I’ve been employed full time since graduating University with a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (no student loan) and during this time I’ve maxed out my company-sponsored retirement account up to the point where they match my contribution (ranging from 2x to 4x my contribution). I’ve also paid into Social Security, of course. Based on my calculations, I’ll be able to retire if I downsize my living expenses and lifestyle. I’ll be able to do this, but I won’t like it.

This is where Bitcoin comes in 😎 My time horizon is 15+ years, I’m DCA-ing with money left over after paying my bills (no debt) and enjoying life (vacations, gifts, experiences, stuff). If BTC goes to $0, I’ll be OK. If it continues to grow as it has, it will be worth more than my entire career’s retirement savings (x some multiplier!), which means my retirement will change from being just OK, yet enjoyable, to being very nice indeed. I see this as icing on the cake, a nice bonus, so to speak. Again, I’m enjoying life currently, living in the moment, and saving for retirement … and on the side, building my bitcoin stack for a potentially nice bonus when I retire.

Just sharing with you my strategy (with time horizon). I laugh at posts saying they’ll sell at $100k and then buy back lower, but their strategy is radically different than mine.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,bitcoin," PSA: Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins - A Hard-Learned Lesson ",2024-11-16 10:11:22,"Just wanted to drop a friendly reminder that hits close to home: **Not your keys, not your coins** isn't just some catchphrase – it's real advice that I really wish I'd taken seriously before losing money in the FTX collapse.

Keeping coins on exchanges is convenient. It's easy to trade, the UI is slick, and cold storage seems like a hassle. But remember:

* Exchanges can freeze your assets
* They can get hacked
* They can go bankrupt (thanks, FTX!)

If you're holding any significant amount of crypto, please take the time to:

1. Get a hardware wallet
2. Learn how to use it properly
3. Keep your seed phrase secure (not on your phone/computer)
4. Only keep trading amounts on exchanges

I learned this lesson the expensive way in 2022 and I'm feeling like this advice needs to be repeated now that the next bull is coming. Don't be like me – protect your coins. The small inconvenience of self-custody is nothing compared to the pit in your stomach when you realize your exchange account is frozen and your funds are gone.

As someone in my similar r/cc post commented, CEXs must be used like public toilet. You go there, do your business and go home with your stuff - maybe scratch that last part when it's about toilets.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

What I hate about this news source is you can guarantee they’re not going to cover how good of an investment this was for El Salvador, and wait until the next bear market to discuss all the negative stories of those who lost money in the space.

Here’s the FUD story from NowThis if you’re curious. The comments are hilarious to see now that Bitcoin is where it’s at now:

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin: The Revolution You Can’t Afford to Ignore,2024-11-15 23:28:17,"In a world where central banks continue to print money into oblivion, Bitcoin has emerged as a revolutionary alternative — not just as digital money, but as a force of decentralization. With inflation hitting historic highs and debt levels skyrocketing, the financial system is in dire need of a reset. **Bitcoin is that reset**.

What’s more, Bitcoin isn’t just a ""store of value"" — it's the ultimate escape from centralized control. While fiat currencies can be manipulated at the whim of governments and banks, Bitcoin’s immutable protocol ensures that it operates independently of any authority. It's based on a finite supply of **21 million coins**, creating an asset class that is immune to inflation and market manipulation. This alone makes it one of the most important financial innovations of our time.

The traditional banking system has failed many, especially in countries with unstable economies. Bitcoin transcends borders — in a world where access to traditional banking is limited, Bitcoin is an open-access, **borderless system**, giving the unbanked and underbanked a chance to control their own wealth. For people living in countries with hyperinflation or authoritarian regimes, Bitcoin provides an essential lifeline — not just for financial freedom, but for **individual sovereignty**.

Consider this: The global debt clock ticks relentlessly upward, while the purchasing power of the dollar continues to decline. Central banks have resorted to quantitative easing, a euphemism for printing money and increasing national debt. In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve alone has increased its balance sheet by 500% over the last decade. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s supply remains fixed. As the price of fiat currency continues to devalue, Bitcoin's intrinsic design ensures its value proposition only strengthens over time. Bitcoin’s **hard cap** means that it will never fall victim to the same monetary policies that have driven traditional markets to the brink.

The **volatility** of Bitcoin is a common argument used by critics, but here's the truth: volatility is part of the maturation process. As more institutional players (like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Fidelity), as well as individual investors, enter the market, Bitcoin’s volatility will continue to reduce. In fact, Bitcoin’s price tends to follow four-year cycles dictated by its **halving events** — each one propelling the price upward, especially when combined with growing adoption. With the most recent halving event in **April 2024**, Bitcoin is well-positioned to experience another significant rally in the near future.

Another aspect often overlooked is Bitcoin’s **proof of work model**, which makes the network not only secure, but also trustless. Every transaction is verified by thousands of independent nodes, making it impossible for any single entity to control or manipulate the system. This means **freedom**, not just in the sense of autonomy over your wealth, but also in terms of security and trust.

Now, think about what happens when Bitcoin becomes mainstream. We’re talking about institutions, corporations, and governments integrating Bitcoin into their financial infrastructure. When that tipping point is reached, Bitcoin won’t just be a speculative asset — it will be the backbone of the global financial system. And here's the key — **that tipping point has just begun**. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and BlackRock are already positioning themselves in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and adoption is accelerating globally.

It’s happening — Bitcoin is not a fringe asset anymore. It’s already becoming the default choice for those who want to escape the monetary chaos caused by irresponsible central banking policies. If you're looking for a way to protect your wealth, diversify your holdings, or assert your financial sovereignty, Bitcoin is the answer.

In the end, it’s simple: **Bitcoin isn’t just a currency; it’s a revolution** in how we view money. A revolution we can all be part of, right now, before the world catches on. So the real question is — are you going to wait until everyone else gets on board, or are you going to take control of your financial future today?

**Bitcoin is not just an investment. It’s freedom in your hands. Don’t let the moment slip away.**",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,bitcoin,BITCOIN FOR TIME!,2024-11-16 05:35:49,"Yo, listen up Bitcoiners, I just had a freakin’ epiphany while pounding the pavement on my morning run through the streets of Fethiye, Turkey. 🌅 And I’m not talking about some weak “got an idea” moment. I’m talking a full-on bolt of lightning straight to the brain ⚡️.

So there I was, sweating my guts out, and it hit me—money, my dudes, is a straight-up scam. It’s like trying to hold sand in your hands: always slipping through your fingers, losing value year after year. And let me tell you, hyperinflation in Turkey? It’s real AF. But even the almighty US dollar? It’s basically on life support. 🚑

So while I was dodging stray cats and kebab stands, I thought, “If the USD is crumbling, what chance does the BRICS meme-currency even have?” Spoiler: none.

💥 Then it hit me like a freight train—Bitcoin is THE only real answer. It’s the ONLY thing that makes sense as a world reserve currency that actually holds up. Unlike the USD or whatever the BRICS gang tries to cook up, Bitcoin is bulletproof against manipulation, dilution, and inflation. 💣

And here’s the mic drop moment: Bitcoin is the only way to store your TIME. Think about it—time is the one thing you can’t print more of, can’t inflate, can’t “stimulate” with BS policies. It’s the hardest, realest asset on this planet. ⏳ We all get our finite slice, and once it’s gone, it’s game over.

So why the hell are we letting our precious time be compensated in fiat toilet paper that’s losing value faster than your ex’s Instagram followers? 🚀 We should be demanding our wages in the hardest damn money on Earth.

🔊 BITCOIN FOR TIME! 🔊

Time is priceless, my friends. Stop trading it for fiat trash that depreciates faster than a Lambo on a gravel road. It’s time to wake up, stack sats, and secure the bag.

Reddit,bitcoin,My fellow bitcoiners,2024-11-16 18:13:16,"My fellow bitcoiners, throughout history, the great nations and great individuals have been those who saw the opportunities of their age and seized them with boldness and resolve. We now stand on the cusp of a revolution, not in lands or empires, but in the very foundations of money itself—Bitcoin.

Just as the pioneers tamed the wilderness, Bitcoin offers a frontier that demands our courage and conviction. It is a scarce resource, immutable and incorruptible, born not of government decree but of innovation and liberty. In an age of monetary uncertainty, where inflation erodes the savings of the diligent, Bitcoin stands as a bastion of individual sovereignty and generational security.

Do not be timid in your actions. The 21 million Bitcoin represent a finite resource, as scarce as the land claimed by our forebears. It is our duty, to ourselves and to future generations, to claim our stake in this frontier before it is closed to us. Imagine what one Bitcoin could mean to your descendants in a century—a treasure of unparalleled worth in a world increasingly driven by scarcity and competition.

I implore you, do not shrink from this opportunity. Just as our nation’s greatness was built by those who had the vision to plant seeds for a future they would never see, so too must we secure this foundation of freedom and wealth for those who will inherit our legacy.

In the words I have always cherished: ‘Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.’ Act boldly and seize this moment, for history will remember the ones who had the foresight to act in the face of opportunity.”

This framing draws on Roosevelt’s belief in rugged individualism, bold action, and building a legacy for future generations. It ties Bitcoin to his ideals of forging new frontiers and securing a lasting legacy.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

It marks the beginning of my descent into the Bitcoin rabbit hole and, much like the Bitcoin White Paper itself, my story is closely tied to the financial crisis of 2008. 

This account is deeply personal, laced with self-pity and a sense of stupidity. That's why I've kept it private and not even shared it with my closest friends, but I think it's important to share it now with you. Giving back to a community I received so much in the previous years. All too often, those who fall victim to the shortcomings of the fiat system internalize the guilt, unaware that they are being taken advantage of by a corrupt fiat system.

My parents, hardworking individuals who dedicated their lives to building their own business from scratch, had little time to acquire financial education. In the early 2000s, they were advised — like many companies and individuals in Austria — to finance their company/house with a Swiss franc loan. The arrangement was complex and opaque, involving multiple loan accounts and significant commissions for both the bank and our financial advisor. My parents, trusting the system, unknowingly became entangled in a speculative gamble, exacerbated by the euro's introduction and the franc's relative strength over time. It turns out that debt in a strong currency and income in a rapidly depreciating currency have only one outcome: Default over time.

As a result of the financial crisis of 2008, the Swiss National Bank could no longer suppress the upward pressure on the franc in 2014 and the fallout was inevitable. Overnight, my family faced a substantially larger loan burden than initially anticipated, to threaten us to file bankruptcy and lose everything we worked for in the previous decade. This devastating turn of events — driven by corrupt banking practices and greedy financial advisors — left an indelible mark on me. As a young man, witnessing my parents' hard-earned savings and efforts eroded by a system they trusted was enough to cement my distrust of financial institutions forever. At this point in time I made a promise to myself: Trust no one, educate yourself and verify.

A few years later, I discovered Bitcoin. It clicked immediately. Here was a decentralized, incorruptible solution to the very problem that had caused so much pain for my family. Bitcoin represented a chance to opt out of a fiat system riddled with perverse incentives and predatory practices. My family's experience — our suffering under the weight of a corrupt financial system — motivates me to advocate for Bitcoin adoption. For this reason, I will never trade my Bitcoin for fiat currency ever, no matter the fiat price. It represents more than wealth to me; it’s a symbol of resilience and justice, a way to honor the sacrifices my parents made.

Looking back, I am almost grateful for this painful chapter of my life. It woke me up and set me on a path I might not have found otherwise. Many people experience similar losses at the hands of the fiat system without even realizing it because the theft happens incrementally, through inflation and hidden costs. Fact is, that honest, hardworking individuals are being robbed every day — second by second — by a system designed to erode their purchasing power over time. Like my parents, but more gradually.

While it’s exciting to see Bitcoin’s fiat price increase, that is not its ultimate value. Bitcoin represents so much more. And I know, many others who HODL Bitcoin not for fiat wealth but for deeply personal reasons — reasons rooted in justice, independence, and freedom. For those of us who have been wronged by the current system, Bitcoin is not just an asset, it’s a revolution for a better future.

Yours forever thankful, Carl. 🧡",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Don’t quit your jobs because of crypto gains,2024-11-16 18:22:55,"It was late winter 2021, and crypto seemed unstoppable. Every new narrative was primed to pump 5x-10x, and all the major influencers and celebrities were jumping in, proudly showing off their NFTs.

Venture capital felt like an endless stream of money pouring into the market, and crypto had finally gone mainstream.

I made life-changing money back then—a new car, a new place—and I started to question everything. Why keep working a job I didn’t enjoy for $100k a year when I could make 5x that in crypto?

The ""easy"" gains made me prideful. I thought I had cracked the code, that I was different. But when the market started to crash, I kept doubling down—buying shitcoins and gambling on risky bets. Then reality hit.

A brutal bear market left me with no income for almost a year until I managed to land another good job.

I’m sharing my story as a cautionary tale for anyone who might think crypto will pump forever or that they’re invincible as an investor. Stay grounded, stay humble, and don’t let the hype blind you.

Blackrock and others acknowledged this risk.  Governments aren't going to accept the risk for very long.

I honestly think this is a good move for Itc to generate some needed hype. I do believe in Itc being a better Bitcoin, but its price action has been pretty bad the past couple of years. Despite that it is regularly in the top 20 coins and has remained weirdly stable.

Ltc has seen a little pump over the last month as well. I think sentiment prior to the “meme conversion” was generally positive as LTC is ear marked to be the next coin with an ETF. Hopefully this comes soon and it can rise the wave to a new ath.
Thanks 


Edit: what I mean by better bitcoin: Technologically bitcoin and litecoin are almost the same. Litecoin has lower fees, higher possible number of total transactions and “bandwidth”, lower confirmation times, MWEB. Ofc btcs price performance has been way better.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Dynamic DCA Exit Strategy + Risk Metric Tier List
",2024-11-16 10:36:52,"9 months ago I created a Post about Dynamic DCA as a buying strategy and tons of people found it useful.  
With BTC surging past the previous ATH, there's been a lot of questions about exit strategies, so I thought I'd create a quick guide and share a tier list of risk metrics (both free and paid) that everyone can use for dynamically DCAing **out** of the market.

**Dynamic DCA Explained:** This approach is about adjusting your investment based on the current market conditions. Unlike traditional DCA, dynamic DCA is more flexible. You still invest at a fixed schedule, but you buy more during times of low risk / corrections and start holding or even **scale out during peak bullmarkets** by using metrics / looking at indicators and adjusting the DCA-out amount based on them.

**But why?** This approach yields much higher returns. At the same time, it helps a ton with the emotional turmoil. Setting a strategy to take profits during bullruns and sticking to it is a godsend when the greed hits. It also helps with the emotional side when DCAing out of the market. It feels stupid to sell the same amount at 90k and 140k. You obviously want to take advantage of changes in the market.

**Here's how I do it**

1. **Select a Risk Metric**: This is crucial. A good risk metric helps you understand the current market conditions, whether it's overbought (high risk) or oversold (low risk). The more accurate the metric, the more powerful your strategy. None of these will be perfect, but they'll be useful.
2. **Set Your Risk Thresholds**: Decide the risk levels at which you'll sell more, do nothing, or even buy back. For example, I start selling when risk goes above 70 and increase the amount I DCA out in steps of 5. So I'll sell 2.5% at 70 risk, 5% at 75 risk and so on - while keeping a core position of 55% that never gets sold.
3. **Stick to it**: Keep an eye on the risk metric each time your DCA time comes around and adjust your sell amounts accordingly (or follow the notifications depending on what you use).

Now, onto the tier list of risk metrics. **This list is based on my personal experience and research over the past 3 years. I've posted this before and it's largely similar.**

**S Tier**

* **AlphaSquared's Risk Metric** ([AlphaSquared](https://alphasquared.io/)): Still my go-to metric. It's been the most accurate during the late 2021 peak and 2022 bottom, nailing everything so far. It also offers a strategy builders and backtesting.
* **Benjamin Cowen's Risk Indicator** ([IntoTheCryptoVerse](https://intothecryptoverse.com/)): Solid choice with a wide range of metrics and a build-your-own-chart workbench. It's pricey, and has been a bit less accurate, but if you can afford it and value the other premium content, it's worth a shot.

**A Tier**

* **CoinTalksCrypto's Bitcoin Bull Run Index** ([CBBI](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)): Free and customizable. It didn't manage to nail either tops or bottoms so far, but it has been readjusted so maybe it'll fare better this time. It's mainly here because you can tweak the inputs if you trust yourself to make that judgement and because it's free.

**B Tier**

* **~~Bitcoin Risk Level~~** ~~(~~[~~Bitstack~~](https://risk.bitstack.se/)~~)~~ Seems like this has been discontinued!
* **LookIntoBitcoin's Reserve Risk** ([LookIntoBitcoin](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/reserve-risk/))
* **TradingView Scripts** mimicking Benjamin Cowen's model. There are a ton.

* **Fear and Greed Index** ([Alternative.me](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)): More of a sentiment gauge than a risk metric. I find it less useful for dynamic DCA, though extreme greed readings can be a helpful secondary indicator.

That's it! I'm sharing this because I KNOW this will be useful for many, judging by the recent posts on here. Just to make things clear, Dynamic DCA-out isn't about timing the market perfectly. It's about making informed decisions based on market conditions, having a plan and scaling out over time and risk (because you can't time the market). You adjust your exit strategy based on the current market state, day by day, as you should.

Feel free to share your experiences or any other tools you find useful for dynamic DCA-out. Maybe I missed some new indicators in the meantime.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,So many temptations to FOMO in a market like this.  So many people talking about moves you could make.  Here's a reminder to take your eyes off the charts and HODL.,2024-11-15 23:46:32,"With the recent surge to $90k and counting, it's clear the bull is back, and social media is starting to buzz with bull market hype, shills, and FUD.  For those of us who have seen a cycle through in the past, this is nothing new.  We all know it's only going to get more intense as crypto gets on the news, Grandpa asks about Bitcoin at Thanksgiving, and millions of newbie investors flood the space looking to FOMO their life savings into whatever the latest meme coin is.

The crypto space will soon be completely euphoric.  It will seem like no matter what you buy, you can't lose.  People will make stupid amounts of money by placing risky bets on alts and meme coins.  You might feel jealous and be tempted to sell your BTC to buy dog farts.  I won't tell you what to do with your money, but I will tell you that while dog farts can indeed produce epic profits, typically those bets are placed too late in the game.

Here's a cautionary reminder to avoid the hype.  It may seem tempting to make a big move; buying, or selling.  Don't fall for FOMO.  If you can handle the risk of buying halfway into a bull run, there's nothing wrong with continuing your DCA.  And if you don't want to risk going further, there's nothing wrong with starting to take profits.  But for the majority of us, assuming you invested your lot sometime in the last year and a half...

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Has Bitcoin stayed true to its original whitepaper?,2024-11-16 19:22:50,"The following documentary makes a good argument that Bitcoin has been heading in a different direction: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzIW52Rgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzIW52Rgc)

It's a rather long watch, but worthwhile I think. Personally I would say Bitcoin has completely abandoned the notion of a decentralized borderless digital cash in favor of a number-go-up store of value narrative, but I wonder what the consensus is here? So what do you think - is this video just inflammatory rhetoric that's portraying the history of Bitcoin in the worst light, or will other cryptos need to fill the digital currency gap that Bitcoin seems to be leaving open?

Since the video is so long, the following is a **summary** of it:  


*Introduction to Bitcoin's Potential*

The video opens with a discussion on how Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt government control over monetary systems, emphasizing its promise of decentralized financial freedom for individuals globally.

*Historical Context of Money Control*

It covers historical events, like the economic crises in Argentina and the 2008 financial crisis, showcasing how traditional banking practices have betrayed public trust. This highlights the necessity for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as alternatives to centralized financial systems.

*Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin's Birth*

The documentary details the creation of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, referring to the original white paper that outlines Bitcoin as a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and discusses the initial success and adoption of Bitcoin.

Block Size Debate and Restrictions

The video delves into the debates surrounding block size limits that hindered Bitcoin's scalability and functionality. It argues that the rigid limits imposed by Bitcoin Core, influenced by Blockstream, have led to high transaction fees and bottlenecks.

*Role of Blockstream*

Blockstream's emergence is critiqued as a major turning point that centralized Bitcoin development under a single group's control, contradicting the decentralized ethos of the protocol and leading to decisions that negatively impacted the original Bitcoin community.

*Censorship and Community Control*

The video discusses how debates and proposals advocating for increasing Bitcoin’s block size have faced censorship, stifling innovation and community input, especially on platforms like Reddit.

*Current State of Bitcoin*

Bitcoin's current trajectory is analyzed, critiquing its transformation into a 'store of value' rather than an accessible currency. The argument is made that Bitcoin has become elitist with high fees, alienating potential low-income users.

*Future of Cryptocurrency*

The documentary concludes by arguing the importance of promoting decentralized alternatives to ensure freedom from central banks and the elitist structures that have co-opted Bitcoin.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Mr Beast the Web3 Crypto Scammer?,2024-11-16 02:41:58,"Coffeezilla just replaced an new investigation into Mr. Beast's crypto dealings.

This comes on the heels of SomaXBT's Twitter investigation of Mr. Beast's projects involving cryptocurrency tokens.

Both Coffeezilla and SomaXBT have spent endless hours watching interviews and identifying the connections of the tokens in questions. Their investigation is much more detailed than anything I can put together.

If the allegations are true, Mr. Beast profited over 23M+ from insider trading and rugpulls. The blockchain is forever and it's interesting that these shady dealings are just now coming to light as all of the alleged scamming activity took place in 2021.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What will an Altcoin season look like this time around?,2024-11-17 00:10:40,"The Altcoin season is a follow up trend to a crypto market direction that BTC controls. Its all the retail investors and larger whale money taking profits out of the OG of crypto after it gets to levels that feels over bought and over stretched and shifts them into coins with a lot lower market cap. When the price of BTC pushes its dominance to new highs the money simply changes hands to get benefits of the Alts that are sharing a lot less part of the pie giving them large potential to rise in price. 

Money normally gets into crypto market in every coin while we experience bull market run, that is why you see all of them get benefit and usually at lot bigger profit margins then BTC since it takes a lot less money to move those coins with a smaller market cap. After that a lot more shifts into the Alts to give it those mind blowing price appreciations that we call the Altcoins season. Will that happen again and to the same extent then previous bull runs? That is the question. 

I have my doubts. I don't think there is any surprise that the price of BTC this time around is largely influence on the way up by ETF purchases that come from pension funds and wealth funds and retail investors that use their registered, locked in funds through ETF getting assess to crypto space for the first time in history. The issue with that growth in those type of investments, while it has the initial effect of BTC going up in price, creating excitement in the whole crypto space, that money will also not get back all its profits into the Alts close to the top or at the times of profits taking. There is no wide number of ETFs that hold other crypto coins outside of BTC and ETH. So the profits will be used for other means or the profits will not be taken since people do not rebalance those pension and wealth funds portfolios as often as retail crowd does. Does that mean we will have no ALtcoin season? No but the expectation of price increases might have to be a bit more realistic this time around.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What Happened At AUTONOMYS In October?,2024-11-16 15:59:29,"https://preview.redd.it/nxvib5pfda1e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d149c5c9d1206554d1eea7702eaed8e56cd2100

October was quite a month for Autonomys, filled with noteworthy progress. I’d like to highlight a few of the most interesting developments. First off, the launch of the Taurus Testnet on October 23rd stood out. Surpassing the 1.5 TiB Space Race capacity goal within hours demonstrated not only the community's dedication but also the network's technical strength. This milestone was a key indicator of Autonomys' growth potential and a strong trial of its technological infrastructure, laying an essential foundation for future Mainnet developments.

There was also the release of Mainnet Phase-1 which commenced on November 6th. This phase is geared towards making storage possible through blocks production and improving on the consensus chain’s security of Autonomys’. Enhancing these fundamental building blocks of the network is more than a mere process of improving technical infrastructure; it creates the conditions for more extensive user participation and network development. A resilient foundational layer is critical to the long-term success of any decentralized system.

Finally, the one that interested me was new strategic partnerships. Key collaborations in the month were with Swan Chain, Masa, and Compute Labs in the month of October. These alliances’ primary goal is to increase Autonomy’s impact and authority in decentralized AI, bring in new skills, and expand its network. It has an crucial position in constructing a better environment for an improved marketplace and new openings for improvement.

All of these updates from October show steady advancement towards Autonomy’s vision. They should be revealing in the coming months. It’ll be interesting to see how these developments unfold in the coming months.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Survival of the Fittest in the Blockchain Ecosystem,2024-11-16 05:23:16,"I’ve been thinking about how Darwin’s theory of evolution, specifically “survival of the fittest,” might apply to cryptocurrencies. I know, analogies most of the time are stupid. Still, if we imagine cryptos as living organisms in a digital ecosystem, only the strongest and most adaptable are likely to survive in the long run.

So, how does this analogy work?

In nature, species that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Similarly, cryptocurrencies that adapt to market demands, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are more likely to thrive.

Let’s look at some examples:

Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Pioneer
- Analogy: Bitcoin is like the first species to colonize a new environment—it’s established and has a significant advantage due to being the first mover.
- Survival Traits: Widespread recognition and adoption as a store of value. Despite scalability issues, solutions like the Lightning Network are helping it adapt.

Ethereum (ETH): The Versatile Adapter
- Analogy: Ethereum is akin to organisms that evolve new functions to exploit different niches.
- Survival Traits: Introduced smart contracts, enabling a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve scalability and energy efficiency.

Tezos (XTZ): The Self-Evolver
- Analogy: Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes.
- Survival Traits: Features a self-amending blockchain that can upgrade without hard forks, allowing it to evolve smoothly. On-chain governance lets stakeholders vote on protocol changes, ensuring collective adaptation.

Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Species
- Analogy: Cardano resembles species that evolve carefully through gradual changes backed by research (think of humans developing advanced tools).
- Survival Traits: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal verification, aiming for long-term scalability and security.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Unexpected Survivor
- Analogy: Like the cockroach, which survives in various conditions despite the odds.
- Survival Traits: Started as a meme but gained a strong community and widespread popularity, showing that community support can be a key survival factor.

Just as in nature, the crypto environment is competitive, and resources (like investment and developer attention) are limited. Cryptocurrencies that can’t keep up may become obsolete, much like extinct species.

So, what do you think? Am I too off? Which cryptocurrencies do you believe are best equipped to survive?",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The media were all over FTX losing $8 Billion. Not much mention of the crypto market up $2 Trillion+ since. ,2024-11-15 13:57:50,"At the time of the FTX collapse reports were around $8.9b of customers funds had gone missing. The demise of FTX was covered literally everywhere, making headlines around the world. All the outlets that you never see any coverage on crypto on were out in force. 

Before long they had the world convinced that FTX was the GOAT exchanges and that SBF had become our King.. the King of Crypto. Which anyone within crypto knew... was a lot of shite. 

Like many, my phone blew up. 'Wow, just heard Bitcoin died"", ""Man, so sorry to hear about the death of Crypto"" etc etc. At the time, my reply was this is all a storm in a teacup, which will blow over with time much the same as Mt Gox, China Fud etc etc. There's actually been worst times to get on board. Like most cycles.. most didn't care. However it's still important to remember that shit will continue to happen, that these early boom/ bust adoption cycles are a feature and will continue to occur for the foreseeable. When crypto winters hit and crypto gets boring these are the greatest times to DCA. 

It will be interesting to see how many media outlets cover Bitcoin breaching $100k but at the end of the day know it won't matter a shit over the long-term.  As for exchanges, in crypto nothings over until it's over. Like Mt Gox many FTX are in line for receiving funds or at least part funds back. I appreciate there's still some argument around what should be due but the takeaway was that, things didn't pan out quite so bad as the media led you to believe.

**TL;DR**

Shit will always happen.  Booms/ Bust adoption cycles are a feature. Keep calm and carry on stacking. Harvest those crypto winters. Fuck the mainstream media. ",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Analysis on the Cosmos IBC,2024-11-16 17:20:54,"**TLDR at the bottom**

***Current state of Interoperability***

As it stands today, there is too much trust in cross blockchain transactions. Bridges act as one of he most vulnerable parts of blockchain and it’s a billion dollar issue. 

**The current model of blockchain bridging tends to operate like this:**

Imagine you send a transaction from *X* chain, to *Y* chain. What happens under the hood is, you a wallet or multiple wallets, held on both chains, as well as smart contracts to initiate transactions between chains. When you send a tractions from one chain to another, these wallets will lock up the tokens on one end, which will initiate a minting nodule on the receiving chain to mint the newly bridged tokens.

How does the communication happen though? In reality, it’s about smart contracts initiating these lock and mint/burn modules. Oracles relay information to each chain, when a change in state and a lock up has been made on the starting chain, and should trigger a mint on the destination chain. In which case, the bridge contracts will act appropriately. 

**Risks in the current system**

This type of bridging leaves a few levels of risk. You have smart contract risk, which likely includes multisig risk. So if enough ravage keys get compromised, or worse,a group of multisig key holders go malicious, then they could theoretically drain the bridge. 

You also have third party oracle risk. So if an oracle receives incorrect information, or has sine sort of issue that halts important information for a period of time, the bridging system may not be operational.

***Comparing this to the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)***

This protocol allows sovereign blockchains that are hooked into it, to communicate freely through light client verification, without the need for multisigs or Oracles.

**It goes like this:**

Chain A and Chain B have a relayer, who agrees to run a light node, that will communicate between chain A and chain B. To initiate this relationship between the two chains however, there must be a “handshake agreement”, to obtain trust in each others ledger as they currently stand. 

At a high level, each one of the chains will perform this step by communicating their algorithm and a snapshot of their consensus state, containing the root hash at the latest block height. The light client then can confirm that these chains are accurately communicating their state, and that they are both compatible for IBC communication, and then the handshake agreement is over and the chains now can communicate through the relayer.

Many validators opt to run relayers, alongside their validating nodes, however, their is no requirement where only a validator can run an IBC relayer.

***IBC’s capabilities***

In general, an IBC transaction can include, but is not limited to coin transfers. It can also transfer arbitrary data, and thanks to Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries, it also includes cross chain smart contract deployment and execution.

These types of base layer communications are essential for ensuring trust, in this trustless bridging system. Relayers actually can’t “miscommunicate”. It’s essentially the chains directly communicating, and the relayer simply relays directly what the chain states, and and a relayer has to sign a direct order of communication from a chain. There is not trust necessary in a relayer, as they can’t change the way the protocol is set to form direct communication. 

This sort of trustless bridging of both transactions and general information, with a direct link from each chain, is extremely important to be able to form seamless communication for cross chain smart contracts and collaborations. This type of bridging will also create a new paradigm to allow for cross chain abstraction, as multi hop IBC transactions will soon allow for any chain to connect to any chain, using the already connected relayers on each chain. 

However, I will save multi hop IBC transactions for another day.

**TLDR;**

**IBC differs greatly from the current state of blockchain bridges. It doesn’t rely on any smart contracts, oracles or multi sigs. Rather it relies on relayers, who can utilize a light client, to form a direct communication link between blockchains.**

**These relayers are able to communicate transactions, as well as arbitrary data, perform Interchain Queries and open up accounts across chains, allowing for easy execution of cross chain smart contracts. There are many different use cases coming from things such as multi hop IBC and ZK IBC, that will make even more efficient cross chain communication, and an even more abstracted IBC.**",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

# Let's talk Moon Burns!

Now that Moons are on both Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, Moons are burned on both chains.

Between October 14th and November 11th:

* 10,527 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in four unique burn events:
* 32,335 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum One ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in fourteen unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is: 42,862 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Despite being new to Arbitrum One - Moons are the 12th most valuable asset in the dead address on Arbitrum One. With almost 80K Moons currently worth over $11,635 having been burned on Arbitrum One so far. Unlike almost every other asset in the Arbitrum One burn address - No Moons were ever minted for the purpose of being sent to the Dead wallet.

This means between both networks \~2.8M Moons have been burned to date!

# 2024 Moon Burn Milestone!

In this update Moons have hit a special Milestone for 2024 that I'm excited to share with the community.

At the start of the year **80,293,585 Moons** were in circulation (excluding the Burn address). As of today a total of 812,771 Moons have been sent to the burn address so far in 2024 making our current circulating supply of Moons 79,480,814.

**That means the circulating supply of Moons has dropped by 1% so far in 2024!**

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin. ,2024-11-14 20:27:07,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

What you might not know is ETH is not alone lots of alts continue to be down against BTC.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Nervos’ Bitcoin layer 2 to be released on mainnet next month,2024-11-15 08:13:30,"Having recently released the RGB++ protocol, a bridgeless isomorphic layer 2 for Bitcoin this year, which garnered significant attention and controversy from many crypto communities - Cell studios from Nervos network is set to release another additional development for the Bitcoin layer 2 narrative. The Fiber -network.

**INTRODUCTION TO FIBER NETWORK**

By building off-chain channels on Nervos CKB, Fiber network aims to combine the successful experience of the Lightning Network with CKB's technical advantages to create a fast, low-cost, and decentralized multi-asset real-time payment network. Specifically:

1. Solving scalability issues: Through off-chain payment channels and multi-hop routing, Fiber Network can achieve high-throughput transaction processing, meeting the needs of large-scale users. 
2. Reducing transaction costs: By reducing the frequency of on-chain transactions, it lowers transaction fees, making micropayments feasible and efficient. 
3. Improving transaction speed: The instant confirmation of off-chain transactions provides a split second payment confirmation experience suitable for various instant payment scenarios. 
4. Multi-asset support: Fiber Network supports payments in a variety of digital assets, offering users a broader range of payment options. 
5. Interoperability: Fiber Network supports interoperability with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, providing support for cross-chain payments and asset transfers. 

👉 Announcing at the recent CKCon held in Thailand, that the Fiber network is in its second proof of concept phase and on its way to **being released to Mainnet in the coming month**.

**INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**

RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps Bitcoin UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and Bitcoin chains to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to Bitcoin without the need for cross-chain transfers or compromising security.

",2024-11-15 09:08:19,"Just wanted to drop a friendly reminder that hits close to home: **Not your keys, not your coins** isn't just some catchphrase – it's real advice that I really wish I'd taken seriously before losing money in the FTX collapse.

Keeping coins on exchanges is convenient. It's easy to trade, the UI is slick, and cold storage seems like a hassle. But remember:

* Exchanges can freeze your assets
* They can get hacked
* They can go bankrupt (thanks, FTX!)

If you're holding any significant amount of crypto, please take the time to:

1. Get a hardware wallet
2. Learn how to use it properly
3. Keep your seed phrase secure (not on your phone/computer)
4. Only keep trading amounts on exchanges

I learned this lesson the expensive way in 2022 and I'm feeling like this advice needs to be repeated now that the next bull is coming. Don't be like me – protect your coins.

I do at this point want to understand though. Where do I start? Is there a good you tube channel to watch to really try to understand all of this?

Will people ever actually use crypto on a daily basis?

 Is it possible that a worse economic situation now to affect this bull run?

Remind me in 2/3 month but I think it will outperform other assests. Some insights:


Technical Innovation

MINA stands out as the world's lightest blockchain, maintaining a constant size of just 22kb regardless of transaction volume. This revolutionary approach enables true decentralization, as anyone can run a full node even from their phone 

Zero-Knowledge Pioneer

MINA is leading the ZK revolution with its zkApps (zero-knowledge applications), offering:
- Unprecedented privacy and scalability
- Off-chain computation with on-chain verification
- Composable proofs that can be reused across applications

Superior Architecture

The protocol uses Zk-SNARKs to create ""snapshots"" of blockchain states, enabling efficient verification without storing the entire chain history. This innovative design is complemented by a modified Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism based on Ouroboros.

Real-World Applications

MINA's ecosystem is expanding rapidly across:
- DeFi applications
- Gaming platforms
- Identity solutions
- Privacy-focused services

Growth Potential

Being featured in Coinbase's COIN50 index alongside major cryptocurrencies demonstrates MINA's growing institutional recognition. The protocol's unique approach to scalability and privacy positions it perfectly for mass adoption.

Developer-Friendly

MINA offers a TypeScript-based development environment, making it accessible to mainstream developers while providing powerful zero-knowledge capabilities. This combination of accessibility and advanced features creates a perfect storm for ecosystem growth.

The future looks incredibly bright for MINA as it continues to pioneer the next generation of blockchain technology. This is not just another L1 - it's a fundamental reimagining of how blockchains can work.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

Reddit,crypto,How to apply Pohlig Hellman using a very limited set of auxiliary inputs in that case ?,2024-11-04 15:25:21,"So I was reading about [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1321). The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

  They prefer vector computers with a single large memory over (new at the time) MPP machines with thousands of processors and distributed memory.  
  


  It made me wonder what they were working on. Isn't most cryptanalysis embarrassingly parallel? Or maybe they focused on problems that don't scale well without a fast interconnect e.g. linear algebra?",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,crypto,Concern for Speed and Scalability of NIST PQC?,2024-09-25 21:23:42,"While I am glad that the NIST announced support for Post-Quantum Algorithms I am concerned about their performance.

Speed and scalability matters in the business world because all organizations are constrained by a budget.

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past. And asking them to train their infosec and opsec teams to learn how to deal with these algorithms that slow down performance will be a difficult task.",2024-11-17 00:58:03.195350

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3.

Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times
