RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Traders Buy the Dip as Solana Stablecoins Soar. Will $BEST Go Bullish?,2025-02-04 11:25:01+00:00,"Ethereum saw some huge selling in the early trading hours of Monday as it dipped below the $2.1K mark – a 25% dip from its opening price that day. This fall was a result of whale wallets liquidating their positions in $ETH. For instance, two dormant wallets sent $149M and $201M worth of $ETH to Bitfinex. These wallets were last active in 2019 when a withdrawal of 77,736 $ETH was made. Aave ($AAVE) also saw some rapid liquidations during this time, totaling around $200M. Most of this liquidation came in the loans that were secured by Wrapped $ETH ($WETH), showing $ETH’s stronghold in the DeFi and crypto lending sector. Consequently, the total value locked (TVL) in $ETH DeFi also fell from $63B to $54B. This fall is akin to the August 2024 fall, which was triggered by the restrictions placed on the Japanese yen carry trade. $ETH dropped to a low of $2,112 back then. However, in just 17 weeks, Ethereum made a comeback and crossed the $4K mark. So, this recent fall isn’t the end of things. It should rather be viewed as a healthy correction in the market. The good news is that $ETH was quick to bounce back and closed above its opening price on Monday. As the price saw a steep dip, whales swooped in to buy the liquidity. Seven Siblings bought 5,382 $ETH, whereas 1inch Investments added $7,289 $ETH to their portfolios near day lows. Put together, whales bought a total of 50,429 $ETH during the fall. This has kindled hopes of recovery amidst long-term holders. A lot of whales have truly ‘bought the dip,’ signaling a long path ahead for Ethereum. Solana’s Upward Journey As Ethereum finds itself in choppy waters, Solana has been making significant progress. Solana stablecoins doubled in market cap in January – from $5.1B to $11.4B. This huge surge can be attributed to the growing popularity of meme coins on the network. Since Trump launched his own Solana-based memecoin, Solana’s stablecoin supply has increased by more than 73%. Interestingly, Circle’s $USDC is the most sought-after stablecoin on the chain, standing at a value of $9.25B. This accounts for more than 80% of all the stablecoin transactions on the network. In contrast, on chains like Ethereum and Tron, Tether’s $UDST is the most dominant stablecoin, with values of $65B and $60B, respectively. Notably, $USDC was the fastest-growing stablecoin in 2024 at a rate of 78%. Its current valuation stands at $53B, which is still some distance away from UDST at $139.5B. However, Circle has been making a lot of progress to narrow down this gap. It recently went live on the Aptos mainnet. Seeing the growth of stablecoins coupled with a meme coin boost by the President of the United States himself, it’s fair to say altcoins have a bright future ahead. If you’re also looking for an opportunity to invest in the best meme coins, we have something perfect for you – the Best Wallet Token ($BEST). What Is $BEST? The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the in-house meme coin of the popular Best Wallet App, which is a one-stop destination for all your crypto needs. The wallet offers access to more than 60 crypto chains, allowing you to manage all your holdings in one place. The $BEST token is the Best Wallet App on steroids, as it unlocks some serious perks within the Best Wallet ecosystem. For instance, Token holders can get early access to high-alpha presales, much before they go live for the general public. This allows investors to jump in early on promising altcoins. You can find these tokens in the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ tab – coins like $PEPU and $CATSLAP were featured on Best Wallet long before they became popular among investors. What’s more, you can also benefit from lower transaction fees as a $BEST holder. Plus, this non-custodial platform doesn’t require KYC, making it simple and quick to get started with. Early adopters of $BEST can also earn staking rewards with 189% APY. It’s worth noting that the developers have reserved 8% of the total token supply of 10B exclusively for this, showing their focus on long-term adoption and rewards. Why Should You Invest in $BEST? Besides all the token benefits you get, the Best Wallet App itself has a bright future ahead. It aims to capture 40% of the $10B non-custodial crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026. Moreover, it has so far walked the talk, garnering over 500K total users and 250K daily active users. The Best Wallet Token presale has also been a huge hit. Within just 14 days of launch, it managed to raise a whopping $1M. As of now, the project has raised $9M and finds itself among the best crypto presales going around. Oh, and wait till you hear about the project’s future. The developers have a lot in the pipeline, including integration of Solana ($SOL) and the launch of Best Card for seamless crypto payments. The project is also in talks for a partnership with apps like Staking, iGaming, Project Directory, News, and DeFi. This will truly make Best Wallet App a one-stop solution and the only crypto wallet anyone will ever need. With all the success that’s to come for the app, it is the $BEST token that will ultimately benefit. Experts say that they won’t be surprised if this turns out to be the next 100x crypto. Currently available for just $0.02385 each, $BEST’s price is set to increase in less than 12 hours, so hurry up and buy $BEST for the lowest possible price. Last but not least, make sure you do your own research before investing in the crypto markets, as they can be highly volatile. Also, this article isn’t a replacement for professional financial advice, and we recommend you consult your advisor before making a move.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Co-Founder Lubin: Whales Are Manipulating ETH Price,2025-02-04 11:00:58+00:00,"Major fluctuations in the Ethereum (ETH) market yesterday triggered a wave of reactions across social media, with one Ethereum co-founder claiming that certain large holders—or “whales”—were deliberately pushing the asset’s price downward. The activity reached a fever pitch on Monday, February 4, when the ETH price swung from around $2,900 to as low as $2,120 before bouncing back sharply. Despite the intraday plunge, Ether ultimately closed the day sporting a 26% green wick—an uncommon price rebound in such a short window. Ethereum Price Manipulated By Whales? Analysts attributed the dramatic movement to external macroeconomic forces, most notably the US trade war under President Donald Trump. After imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada early in the day, the president later struck an arrangement that spurred a rapid recovery across global markets, including cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tanks 25%: What’s Next After the Major Decline? The turbulence led one observer, identified simply as “intern” (@intern), the director of growth at Monad, to post a stark sentiment on X: “ETH is dying right in front of us. honestly never thought this would happen.” In response, Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin offered a composed outlook, underscoring that these types of price swings are not unusual for the digital asset: “It happens regularly. Then it surges. What we are seeing is whales taking advantage of economic turmoil and negative sentiment to shake out weak hands, run stops, and then buy back when they can run that same playbook in reverse.” Lubin’s statement presents a cyclical understanding of crypto volatility, implying that larger players capitalize on market anxiety—often exacerbated by macro developments—to pressure less resilient investors into selling. Several prominent crypto traders also commented on the events, specifically on accusations of whale-led manipulation. One well-known figure, Hsaka (@HsakaTrades), advised newcomers not to assume ETH’s decline was driven purely by organic market sentiment: “Dear noobs, Ethereum is NOT naturally going down. It is being pushed down via whales placing spoofy sell orders on exchanges to make noobs and risk managers sell to ‘buy back lower’. They are stealing your bags and will make you buy back at a higher price.” Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target The notion of a concerted “spoofing” strategy—where large sell orders are placed and then canceled or only partially filled—has long circulated within crypto communities. The tactic reportedly aims to trigger panic sells, thereby letting so-called whales accumulate positions at more favorable price levels. Prominent trader Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) offered a brief but pointed reaction, highlighting how ETH has underperformed relative to Bitcoin (BTC) over the past three years: “3 year shake out so far. Hope you’re right.” The question of why whales would single out Ether in particular was raised by community member EVMaverick392.eth (@EVMaverick392): “Maybe I’ll sound naive, but why do whales perform this maneuver exclusively on ether?” Lubin responded by drawing a parallel to conventional bank robberies and suggesting that the recent wave of unease surrounding the Ethereum ecosystem has made the asset a prime target: “Why do bank robbers rob banks— or used to? The (unjustified) FUD toward the Ethereum ecosystem is currently most pronounced.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,704.

After a significant change in market mood, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization passed $2,900. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Wrecked As Trump’s Tariffs Spark $2 Billion Liquidation Interestingly, Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, weighed in on the situation, remarking that it is a strategic opportunity to acquire ETH. Tariff Pause Sparks Market Rebound Concerns over possible tariffs on Canada and Mexico rattled the crypto market earlier this week. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum fell significantly; Ethereum dropped momentarily to around $2,360. Still, the temporary suspension of the tariffs by Trump offered a breather, which raised investor confidence in risk assets including cryptocurrency. In the wake of the announcement, Ethereum experienced a robust recovery, with a nearly 20% increase. Traders interpreted this as an invitation to re-enter the market, and ETH promptly reclaimed the $2,900 mark. In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH. — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025 Eric Trump’s Crypto Endorsement Raises Eyebrows Eric Trump posted his optimistic view on Ethereum on social media. He first said, “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH. You can thank me later.” Although the subsequent section of his remarks was deleted, crypto investors saw resonance in his endorsement of Ethereum’s future development. The Trump family has been progressively involved in the digital asset sector, particularly through their World Liberty Financial platform. This most recent statement serves to emphasize their involvement and potential long-term dedication to blockchain technology. World Liberty Financial’s Significant Ethereum Transaction World Liberty Financial recently made a substantial move in the crypto space, which has served to further fuel speculation. The firm transferred over $300 million in assets to Coinbase’s custody platform, according to blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain. Furthermore, they acquired an additional 1,826 ETH for approximately $5 million and converted nearly 20,000 Lido Staked Ether (stETH) into ETH. World Liberty Financial (@worldlibertyfi) moved $307.41M in 8 assets to #CoinbasePrime 6 hours ago—as part of treasury management and business operations. Shortly after, the project unstaked 19,423 $stETH to $ETH and further spent 5M $USDC to buy 1,826 $ETH at $2,738.… https://t.co/Rp9NAFUs5N pic.twitter.com/5bfIvJma7U — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 4, 2025 These transactions indicate that the company is making preparations for the introduction of its “Earn and Borrow” lending protocol. Although the protocol is still in the process of being developed, the substantial transfers suggest that the platform could soon play a significant role in decentralized finance (DeFi).

The cryptocurrency’s price has surged 7.5% in the last 24 hours, recovering from its three-week low and leading some analysts to suggest the bleeding might be over. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Solana Falls To Three-Week Low Over the weekend, Solana recorded a 27% price plunge from Friday’s highs to a three-week low of $175. This performance followed the overall market crash, fueled by the US president’s recently announced tariff on the country’s three biggest trading partners. On February 1, the white house revealed that Donald Trump was implementing new tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. This measure was met with similar responses from the two neighboring countries, which announced they would implement tariffs on US imports. The fear of a global tariff war sparked a massive sell-off that saw Bitcoin’s price plummet to $91,200 and Ethereum’s price drop to $2,100. Additionally, the market registered at least $2.3 billion in liquidation, although Bybit’s CEO suggested the figure could be up to $10 billion. Solana lost the key $200 support zone and fell below $180 on Sunday night. As the market struggled, some analysts suggested that SOL’s price risked a deeper fall. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that SOL could retrace to $138 if it lost the $191 support from its multi-month ascending channel. Crypto trader Bluntz considers that losing the $220 support was “really bad” for the altcoin, as it resembled 2021’s bearish divergence sign. Additionally, it invalidated the “ABC from the highs” and made it look “more impulsive,” which would require a “miracle” to overcome it. SOL Must Hold These Levels Despite falling below the crucial levels, the cryptocurrency retested the $170-180 support zone and bounced from the $175 mark, attempting to break the $200 resistance in the following hours. Crypto analyst Jelle noted that Solana “retraced the TRUMP memecoin pump,” which saw SOL reclaim the $220 resistance and jump to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $295. However, Jelle considered that SOL’s structure “remained sound” during the drop and that its chart looked “very solid” as the cryptocurrency recovered on Monday morning. It’s worth noting that amid the market bleeding, Solana was among the cryptocurrencies that showed strength. SOL, like BTC, held its key horizontal levels, remaining within its post-US elections price range. Related Reading: BNB Bounce From $500: A Temporary Recovery Or Start Of A Rally? Martinez pointed out that “In the middle of this madness, the TD Sequential indicator presents a buy signal on the Solana daily chart.” Meanwhile, Miles Deutscher highlighted that BTC and SOL’s prices were “now higher than yesterday’s pre-liquidations,” noting the high volatility affecting the market. Moreover, Solana, alongside BTC and XRP, is among the only top 10 cryptocurrencies recording green numbers. Jelle considers that if SOL closes above the monthly and weekly supports between $200 and $210, it will continue its solid performance to retest the $240 resistance and see “another push for $300.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $211, a 7.5% increase in the daily timeframe.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Best Crypto to Buy Now After Largest Liquidation Event Since FTX Collapse,2025-02-04 07:54:31+00:00,"Donald Trump’s plan to put large tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada, and China has stirred up a storm in the crypto market. A massive sell-off happened over the weekend, with the total crypto market cap dropping by half a trillion dollars. Although several news outlets suggest that over $2.27B have been liquidated, Bybit’s CEO says the liquidation could well be in the $8B-10B range. He believes the numbers being circulated don’t reveal the full picture because crypto exchanges typically limit liquidation data. Even worse, most of these liquidations come from long positions, i.e., from traders who were hoping Trump’s nomination as US president would lead to bullish times. It’s worth noting that Trump’s own meme coin, $TRUMP, crashed 40% in the last seven days. On the bright side, though, the crypto economy’s Trump-fueled correction means that the best meme coins are now available at a discount. However, it’s important you select fundamentally strong tokens that also enjoy market hype. We’re here to help; here’s the best crypto to buy now, as they’re best positioned to ride out slumps and skyrocket during the imminent bull run. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for First-Time Investors Solaxy ($SOLX) is an altcoin set to explode, but don’t be fooled by its meme appeal – it provides a lot of utility, so much so that analysts are saying it’s the perfect token to weather the correction in crypto and 100x your investment. We’ve identified two major reasons why $SOLX’s presale has been an out-and-out success, raising over $17M at the time of writing. 1. Solana is continuously rising through the ranks and giving the best cryptos a serious run for their money.  For instance, it recently beat Ethereum in monthly revenue – $116M in January 2025 as compared to Ethereum’s $107M. Moreover, the Solana ecosystem’s market cap surged 110% in just the last 30 days. 2. By removing Solana’s pain points (network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability) Solaxy will breathe new life into the network. Invest in one of the best crypto presales by visiting the Solaxy website and connecting a crypto wallet like Best Wallet. You can get 1 $SOLX for just $0.001624 if you get in now. For more information on the buying process, check out our guide on how to buy $SOLX. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Token of the Best Wallet App One of the most prevalent market phenomena is buying the dip – exactly what’s happening now. A surefire way to get behind this phenomenon is investing in a crypto wallet, with Best Wallet simply being the best there is. And it also has its very own token, the Best Wallet Token. With Best Wallet set to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026, the $BEST token has become one of the hottest crypto presales in 2025. It supercharges the entire Best Wallet ecosystem, offering token holders a wealth of benefits. These include early access to high-potential projects, reduced transaction fees, voting rights for enhanced governance, and increased staking rewards.  The $BEST presale’s performance is only a confirmation of its huge potential. With over $9M in presale funding so far, the current price of $0.02385 per token offers an attractive entry point for early adopters. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Offers a Safer Approach to Investing in Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) offers a less risky way to invest in meme coins, making it one of the most promising cryptos to include in your February portfolio. Simply put, it offers four baskets of meme coins, each with a different risk level, profit potential, and volatility. Depending on your risk appetite, you can choose a Meme Index basket. For instance, if the current market scenario makes you more conservative than usual, the Meme Titan Index, which contains the top 10 meme coins, will be ideal for you. However, if you’re a more aggressive investor and believe that a dip is worth capitalizing on, you can choose the Meme Frenzy Index, which is more risky but also more rewarding. $MEMEX is currently in presale and has already raised over $3M since its launch in December 2024. If you like how Meme Index simplifies meme coin investment and would like to benefit from its popularity, visit the $MEMEX website and buy it for just $0.0158443 each. Here’s how to buy it. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Smelly Fun to Weather the Current Crypto Storm A token meant solely for amusement, it surprised a lot of investors that $FARTCOIN was among the very few meme coins that actually jumped during Trump’s tariff storm. It’s up by a whopping 13.78% in the last 24 hours, proving that tough times may come and go, but humor stays! Fartcoin is based on…well, farts! The project rewards token holders with free tokens if they submit fart jokes and memes. What’s more, even the creation of Fartcoin was unserious. Essentially, the project was an AI chatbot’s idea, but it wouldn’t have seen the light of day had an unknown developer not decided to take inspiration from the AI’s conversations. Although $FARTCOIN has taken a beating in the last month or so, it has formed a good-looking ascending triangle pattern – and a breakout over the $0.90–$1.00 zone could really send the coin soaring. 5. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – OG Meme Coin Ready to Rocket Another meme coin that has been unaffected by the recent crypto dip is the OG Dogecoin. It has, in fact, rallied more than 12% since yesterday, showing why it’s a great all-weather crypto. Interestingly, $DOGE is also a part of Meme Index’s Meme Titan basket, which is a low-risk assortment of meme coins. This is further confirmation of Dogecoin’s stability. Moreover, a double bottom pattern suggests Dogecoin may lead crypto market gains this month. It’s currently trading at $0.26. Verdict Having mentioned the best crypto to buy now when the market is reevaluating itself, it’s very important that you’re careful because dips can be awfully notorious. None of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing, as well as do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Solana Has Seen A Buy Signal On The TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that Solana has displayed on its daily price chart. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in an asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Fearful For First Time Since October: Buying Signal? The TD Sequential involves two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, the setup, candles in the chart of the same color are counted up to nine (with it not mattering whether the candles are consecutive or not). Once the candles are in, the setup is to be complete and the asset could be assumed to have reached a potential location of turnaround. As soon as the setup is done with, the second phase, the countdown, kicks off. In this phase, too, candles of the same polarity are counted up, but this time, the phase doesn’t end until thirteen of them are in. When the countdown ends, the coin could be considered to have arrived at another possible reversal. Naturally, where the cryptocurrency heads off after a TD Sequential phase depends on the candles that led to the phase’s completion. Red candles imply a reversal to the upside, while green candles indicate a potential top has been reached. Solana has recently completed a TD Sequential phase of the first type on its 1-day price chart. Below is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows this pattern for the asset. As is visible in the graph, Solana has finished a TD Sequential setup with nine red candles recently, which implies that the asset could have arrived at a bottom. A week ago, XRP also witnessed a signal in the indicator, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. Here is the chart for the setup that the coin formed: From the graph, it’s apparent that XRP saw a sell signal on the TD Sequential last week. The pattern appears to have held for the cryptocurrency, as its price has crashed since the signal has emerged. Related Reading: Stablecoins See Positive Momentum: Will This Lead To New Bitcoin All-Time High? It now remains to be seen whether the TD Sequential would hold for Solana as well and result in a fresh rally for the asset. So far, signs are looking in the right direction as SOL has seen a bit of a rebound from its lows. SOL Price Solana briefly went under the $180 mark during the crash, but the asset has since bounced back to $207. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

ADA is now correcting losses and struggling to clear the $0.80 resistance. ADA price started a fresh decline from the $0.9250 zone. The price is trading below $0.850 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.8050 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it trades below the $0.7650 support zone. Cardano Price Faces Resistance After struggling to stay above the $0.950 level, Cardano started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA declined below the $0.90 and $0.850 support levels. There was a clear move below the $0.60 support zone. A low was formed at $0.5105 and the price recently started a decent upward move. The price cleared the $0.60 and $0.70 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9828 swing high to the $0.5105 low. However, the bears are now active near the $0.80 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.8050 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Cardano price is now trading below $0.80 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.80 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9828 swing high to the $0.5105 low. The first resistance is near $0.820. The next key resistance might be $0.850. If there is a close above the $0.850 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.9250 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.00 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.80 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.7650 level. The next major support is near the $0.7230 level. A downside break below the $0.7230 level could open the doors for a test of $0.6880. The next major support is near the $0.6250 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.7650 and $0.7230.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Market Performance Shows Signs of Distribution Cycle, Analyst Reveals",2025-02-04 05:00:19+00:00,"Bitcoin market activity over the past day has been marked by turbulence, with its value falling to as low as $90,000 levels earlier today before rebounding to just above $94,000. Despite this partial recovery, the cryptocurrency remains down 5.8% over the past week and more than 13% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached in January. This recent price movement has led a CryptoQuant analyst to suggest that Bitcoin may be transitioning into a distribution cycle, a phase where price gains start to slow as supply shifts toward newer market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Is Trading In This Bearish Flag — What’s The Downside Target? Bitcoin Transitioning From Accumulation to Distribution The analyst known as Oinonen, discussed the current state of Bitcoin’s market cycle in a recent post titled “Entering the Distribution Cycle.” Oinonen noted that after gaining 129.2% over the past year and surpassing $100,000, Bitcoin might be nearing a “cycle top.” He cited comments from Ki Young Ju, who suggested that the market is in the “early distribution phase” and could potentially see a few more quarters of growth, influenced by retail investors entering the market and broader promotional efforts. Applying Dow Theory to Bitcoin’s recent market patterns, Oinonen explained that the cryptocurrency’s market movements can be divided into accumulation and distribution phases. He pointed out that while 2022 represented a clear distribution cycle, Bitcoin transitioned into an accumulation cycle in 2023, which extended through 2024. Now, as 2025 unfolds, Bitcoin appears to be shifting back into a distribution phase. Despite this shift, Oinonen emphasized that the market still has the potential for further price discovery, citing relatively low funding rates and a lack of overleveraged conditions. Price Supports and Future Outlook Oinonen also cited Axel Adler Jr, another market observer, who shared similar sentiments, noting that Bitcoin’s current market environment is not overheated and retains the potential for additional growth under stable macroeconomic conditions. This view is supported by the ongoing institutional demand reflected in MicroStrategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases. The company has continued its pro-cyclical acquisition strategy, adding 10,107 bitcoins in early 2025 and bringing its total holdings to 471,107 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $108K: Can Bulls Sustain Momentum Against Bearish Signals? This sustained institutional interest serves as a leading indicator of market confidence and highlights Bitcoin’s continued appeal as a long-term investment. Oinonen mentioned that as Bitcoin hovers near its “fair price” support level of $87,990—identified by its power-law fit—further developments should be watched out for. The analyst added: Despite the approaching distribution cycle, Bitcoin might still reach significantly higher spot price levels. Bitcoin’s funding rate is relatively low and comparable to summer 2024 levels. We’re far from an overleveraged market, and the structure supports further spot price discovery.

The price is back above $2.65 and now faces hurdles near the $2.820 level. XRP price started a strong upward move above the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.820 resistance zone. XRP Price Recovers Over 25% XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.850 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price declined heavily below the $2.50 and $2.350 support levels. The bears even pushed it below $2.00. There was a sharp drop of over 25% and the price tested the $1.75 zone. A low was formed at $1.75 and the price recently started a sharp recovery wave. The bulls pumped the price above the $2.20 and $2.50 levels. There was a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

A clear move above the $2.940 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance or even $3.120 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.20. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.820 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.620 level. The next major support is near the $2.50 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.50 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.450 support. The next major support sits near the $2.350 zone.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin 4-Hour RSI Hits Oversold Zone – Is A BTC Rebound Near?,2025-02-04 03:30:27+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had a volatile 24 hours, plunging from $99,500 to as low as $91,231 amid mounting concerns over impending US trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. However, some crypto analysts see this sharp decline as a buying opportunity, suggesting that BTC may be oversold and poised for a rebound. Is Bitcoin Poised For A Relief Rally? Yesterday, the crypto market experienced one of its largest sell-offs in history, with over $2.3 billion in liquidations affecting more than 742,000 traders. This level of liquidations surpasses those seen during the COVID market crash in March 2020 and the FTX collapse in November 2022. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Wrecked As Trump’s Tariffs Spark $2 Billion Liquidation Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that BTC may have entered oversold territory, signaling a potential relief rally. Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen shared insights in a post on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold levels. He noted: For the 5th time since August 2024, Bitcoin’s 4-hour RSI is becoming oversold. Each of the prior signals were attractive accumulation periods, even if price made new short-term lows after the signal flashed. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether BTC is overbought or oversold. A reading above 70 suggests overbought conditions – potential for a pullback – while a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions – potential for a rebound. According to Franzen’s chart, Bitcoin’s current RSI is hovering around 24 on the 4-hour timeframe, indicating that BTC may be in an attractive accumulation zone. If historical trends hold, BTC could be on the verge of a short-term recovery. Is There More Trouble For BTC Ahead? As of the latest updates, Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum have agreed to temporarily delay the proposed trade tariffs, offering some relief to financial markets. However, uncertainty remains regarding trade negotiations with Canada, leaving investors cautious about BTC’s next move. Related Reading: Is The Crypto Market ‘Satiated’ For Now? Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Johnny’s analysis indicates that “the meat” of BTC’s current down move is likely over. The analyst added that as long as BTC continues to trade above range lows and the yearly open, it will “look good compared to the rest of the market.” However, not all experts are optimistic. Renowned businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki warns that BTC could face further downside pressure if Trump follows through with his tariff plans.  According to Kiyosaki, increased tariffs could strengthen the US dollar, potentially driving investors away from risk assets like Bitcoin in the short term. At press time, BTC trades at $98,644, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from X and TradingView.com",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Do I just hold on to like 99,999,000 tokens, release 1000 of them at $1 a piece? Can I release more to the market in a slow manner? Or do I just release 49% of them so nobody can make a run and liquidate my entire supply of tokens?",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Was trading some other coins when the coin rugged, and then I noticed I lost like $10 worth of sol from my wallet for no apparent reason. I was searching so hard and thought my wallet got compromised or something. Turns out, when I was putting the take profits and stop losses, the priority fee was set to 0.01 SOL and bribery fee was 0.02 SOL. Please don’t flame me yall but since im new and starting off with a small portfolio, I usually put 0.001 for both priority fee and bribery fee.. Anyways, I’m guessing the take profit order executed right when the coin rugged so then while it was in the process of completing, the stop loss order also triggered at the same time and resulted in 2 transactions.. Newbie mistake but for any newbies like me out there, only put 1 auto sell order, either take profit or sell profit or you can put both if the coin is well established.

Reddit,solana,Looking for Developer to Create Sniper Bot on Solana (Monitoring Instant Drops + Automatic Purchase),2025-02-03 21:07:50,"**Description**:  
I’m looking for a developer with experience in blockchain, preferably with knowledge of Solana and trading bot development, to create a custom sniper bot.

**What I need**:

* A bot that monitors the price of a specific token on Solana (the token I define) in **real time**.
* The bot must identify **instant price drops** relative to the **last recorded price**. For example, if the price drops **20% at once** (the percentage will be configurable by me), the bot should execute an **automatic purchase order** immediately after detecting the drop.
* **Important**: The 20% drop (or another defined percentage) must be **instantaneous**, meaning a sharp price drop, not a gradual decline that accumulates over time.
* The bot must be **extremely fast and efficient**, ensuring the purchase is made at the desired price without significant delays.
* It doesn’t need to operate 24/7 – I want to be able to manually **activate and deactivate** it whenever I want.
* The bot should operate on **only one token at a time**, as I define.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,solana,This is why 99% of Blockchains are complete crap nowadays.,2025-02-02 18:36:48,"No, im not talking about the price of tokens and all that, Im talking about why development of new products seems to have stalled out. Everything thats being released is a rehash of something else. I mean gd how many tamagotchi dapps do you need on one blockchain or snake clones etc...

Its because Devs get punished by the community when we talk about our projects. We are told we are shilling or advertising when we are looking for other devs to help out with some code, or to let them know, ""Hey, I have a tool to do that!""

And the fault is with the Blockchain and uneducated mods who cant tell the difference between a command line app and a trading bot...bot even joking

For instance, I created a post about a WIP solana project. Labeled it Dev. The goal was to try and find other devs to help finish it since its 50% complete and let people know the tool exists.

Its a debian/Ubuntu (I also have a mac apple script and win powershell version in the works) tool that lets devs create tokens on testnet and devnet on the fly with one click. It also walks you through how to create a DAO etc. It also allows devs to create protected tokens on mainnet to test out apps, but they come with a 99% buy, sell and trade tax unless the wallet holds the tax-free token/nft or if trading is done inside the devs app via the contract.

That feature is designed to prevent snipers from taking the $50-$100 in LP devs use when testing their product. I for instance lost 2500 just 2 days ago from bots auto buying the unlisted, unmarked test token I created.

Everytime I put any USDC or Solana in the LP to test their swap functions between their dApp's ecosystem and token, bots instantly sold everything they had, completely draining the pools. Then when it was low, more bots would buy. Rinse and repeat.

Between that and my client refusing to reimburse me as per our contract, ""Because thats just how its supposed to be.""  I cant even afford my rent now. So, I torched the code I wrote for my client and said if you dont pay for my services you dont get my code!

GG Mods. You pissed all over another dev who is trying to improve the Solana ecosystem. I dont even know how you think a Project that is 100% free and fully open-source (its a bash script so no encoded binaries) that is only 50% functional that is advertising.

 The entire thing is command line only. No gui, no web3 or anything like that. Again, purely designed for testing, the everyday user wouldn't know what to do with it. 

It just pisses me off that scammers can sit here post 100000 posts about bots, private groups, pump and dump discord/telegram channels, but they dont get their shit deleted 100% of the time.

Yet I spends hours and hours creating tool over 1k lines of bash script that is open-source, completely free and designed to help new devs just getting into the scene, hopefully to figure out away to get rid of the scammers the have destroyed Solana and yet im the yelled at for SELLING, ADVERTISING AND OFFERING SERVICES LIKE BOTS when my app is not even close to any of those. Im trying to combat bots and scammers.

Next time I hear people whining why no one ever develops anything to fight the bots and scammers, Im just gonna have them message the mods here and have them explain why devs cant talk about their projects they are creating to prevent that bullcrap

And to be clear, NO, POSTING A LINK TO A WIP PROJECT THAT IS 100% FREE IS NOT ADVERTISING because im not selling anything I dont have any projects I do sell. I'll say it again just in case you still haven't understood it's trying to attract other developers and to let the community know their developers working on solutions to the issues such as scammers and bots.

But GG guys, way to get rid of yet another Solana Dev. Now I get why 99% of all the other devs I know said solana isn't worth it, just a bunch of idiots, scammers and skids.

Reddit,solana,BEWARE of the new biggest crypto scam of 2025,2025-02-02 06:25:23,"Social media influencers and accounts with big followings are using meme coins to scam people and get away with it here is how they are doing it... (I ask the moderators please leave this up).

These people may have millions of followers on TikTok, YouTube, and/or Instagram.

They promote a meme coin on their X (Twitter) page, claiming it to be completely legit. However, these accounts will always be **barely used** and have **little to no followers** at all.

You'll usually see them post things at the beginning like ""supply locked"", ""dex paid"", or ""tokens burned"", in order to make the project seem more real.

The way they scam is by having separate wallets or usually **bundled** wallets containing a very large amount of tokens early on. These wallets will **gradually** sell, avoiding a big obvious rug pull (like hawktuah).

After all the wallets sell off their profit the creator will either slowly stop posting about it or quickly delete it to make it look like nothing ever happened.

Not enough people will be affected to make a commotion and hurt their reputation

TLDR;

Big influencers promote meme coins on Twitter accounts that have no followers to scam people and suffer no consequences because there won't be enough people affected or enough people to notice.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

I figured it out. The problem was I have Metamask and Phantom.

Reddit,solana,The Billionaires are meddling in  crypto and reaping retail investors quickly and slowly,2025-01-31 22:41:14,"
The crypto market today is a battlefield dominated by billionaires running coordinated cons against retail investors. From celebrity meme coins to the AI narrative, from Murad’s list of “approved” tokens to the Bitcoin ETF hype, everything is designed to extract liquidity from everyday traders and funnel it into the hands of the elite.
	•	Celebrity Coins: These are blatant cash grabs where influencers launch tokens, pump them through social media, and dump on their own followers. The result? Retail gets wrecked, while the celebrities and their insider teams walk away with millions.
	•	AI Narrative: Every major financial cycle has its golden gimmick, and AI is the latest. AI-powered crypto projects are being marketed as revolutionary, but most are just vaporware with no real-world adoption.
	•	Murad’s List: Hedge funds and institutions play a different game, quietly accumulating assets before making them “investable” for the masses. By the time a coin makes it onto these curated lists, the upside is already gone, and retail is left buying the top.
	•	Bitcoin ETF Manipulation: The ETF approval brought a wave of institutional money, but it’s clear that the game is rigged. Institutions use ETF flows to control Bitcoin’s price, squeezing out retail traders and extracting profits through market manipulation.

The Only Real Play Left: Finding a Quality CTO Project

With all this noise, retail investors are left searching for the few legitimate opportunities that billionaires haven’t yet flooded with their capital. The answer? Finding a strong Community Takeover (CTO) project before it enters the mainstream. A successful CTO means that a project is no longer in the hands of a corrupt dev or insider VC firms but is instead guided by its community.

Reddit,solana,Understanding the flow of legitimate token creation on the Solana Network.,2025-02-01 16:20:22,"Hi, 

I've posted a few times before about a token project that I am working on and wanted to verify that I'm understanding the flow of a legitimate project. Again, I **do not** want this to be sniped or rug pulled by bots and I'm trying to create something real. 

Steps:

* 1 - Create token (Revoke: Freeze, Mint and Update)
* 2 - Create Liquidity Pool 
* 3 - Create Pre Sale from Liquidity Pool (Burn all unsold)
* 4 - Air Drop to community
* 5 - List on Dex

\--------------

**I also want to vest DEV coins for a period to battle bots/snipers, but I do not know when this actually occurs?**

* Basic Tokenomics I have drafted would look something like this (this is a draft, not final).
* **40%** Vested Dev team shares (The intent here is to remain in ""control"" of the token via an amount that cannot be sold/traded for a time period to block rug pulls/etc. 
* **10%** Whitelist - at a discount from listing on dex?
* **25%** Multiple Air Drop campaigns - this is a community project.
* **25%** Available for sale at launch

Is this similar to other legit projects? I'm also typing up a white paper on the project and the utility we are trying to bring.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?


Thx for your responses mates.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to encrypt data inside a smart contract on Ethereum?,2025-01-30 22:00:52,"Hello, everyone!

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

So, my question is: is there any way to encrypt data within Ethereum using another person's public key, whether with RSA, ECC, or some other approach? Has anything been developed to achieve this?",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

The challenge is that I only have the recipient's **Ethereum address**, but encryption typically requires their **public key**.

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

Short story short: What are main advantages of wBTC on Cardano, compared to Ethereum? Why would someone choose to wrap their BTC on Cardano instead of Ethereum?",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

They went to Bangalore for some meetup, conducted some meetups in my city and now they arr going to eth denver, one of them posted about the visa approval and tickets to the event. I was stunned.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO.

It's been going well, but for the last year we've been stuck in the 1,500-2,000 monthly users range. We tried many things to grow further - from tweeting, through partnerships up to countless product improvements - but somehow we can't get to the next level.

Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Blockchain Co-Founder for Nonprofit AI Language Startup (2000+ African Languages),2025-01-23 10:02:59,"**The Problem:**  
OpenAI, Meta, and Orange recently announced efforts to build AI for African languages. But here’s the catch: Africa has 2,000+ languages, many with little to no digital data. Without datasets, even the best AI models can’t bridge this gap.

**What We’re Doing:**  
We’re a nonprofit team building a blockchain and tokenomics-powered solution to crowdsource, validate, and incentivize the creation of African language datasets. Think decentralized data ownership, community-driven contributions, and equitable AI access.

**Who We Are:**

\- A team of **4 founders with 27+ combined years** in product development, startups, and AI/data systems.

\- Backgrounds: **AI engineer, Data Engineer, Statistician, Product Engineer, Non-profit and Funding**

\- Committed to impact over profit (**nonprofit structure**).

**We Need You:**

\- Blockchain/tokenomics expertise (Solana, Polygon, smart contracts, token design).

\- Technical enough to lead protocol development.

\- Aligned with the mission: Solve the data desert for African languages.

\- Comfortable with early-stage uncertainty (we’re pre-funding).

**No Fluff:**

\- This isn’t a “get rich quick” project, it is for the long haul. If you want hype, look elsewhere.

\- We’re not here to compete with OpenAI or any other AI war-lord—we’re solving the foundational problem they can’t ignore.

\- Remote work, no location preference.

**If This Resonates:**  
DM me with:

\- Your experience with blockchain projects

\- Why you would like to join us.

\- A brief intro about yourself

Let’s build something real.

P.S. Already working on African language datasets, blockchain for social impact, or decentralized AI? Let’s collaborate, not compete.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

I was not as educated as now so I did not realised that later I wont be able to transfer the btc, only sell and im into holdiiing 🥲. So my opinions:

1. Let the btc there(0.007BTC), dont care and start to use other platform

2. Sell the btc, wait for dip and buy on other platform (maybe kraken, what do you think ?) 

3.Sell the btc and buy immadiatly

If anything you should be buying more crypto knowing that fiat currency is getting weaker. Are people genuinely this stupid? Like everyone is going to dump and by next week or shortly after, everything will be up again.  It’s fucking absurd lmao.

Reddit,bitcoin,"Ian Grigg, TEA and the Flower Currency: A Part of Bitcoin History",2025-02-03 20:37:15,"From recent X spaces with Ian: ""Pressed flowers as a digital currency were much like today's memecoins. We used them as test units—play and toy units for our system for about 10 years. Programmers testing code would send pressed flowers back and forth, making transactions without consequences if something went wrong. It was a safe way to experiment.""

Ian Grigg introduced the concept of triple-entry accounting (TEA), which extends the traditional double-entry system by adding a third, shared ledger entry that is cryptographically secured. This third entry acts as a verifiable record of transactions, reducing fraud and enhancing trust between parties without a central intermediary. His work on TEA was influential in the development of blockchain technology. His ideas on immutable, shared ledgers are mirrored in how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies maintain a public, decentralized ledger of transactions. The notion of 'the receipt is the transaction' from TEA directly relates to how blockchain transactions are recorded and verified.

Ian was also involved in the 'Flower Currency Project' aimed at using physical items (like pressed flowers) to represent digital assets, showcasing early experiments in linking physical and digital value, which parallels the concept of tokenization in modern cryptocurrencies where digital tokens represent real-world assets or rights.

Grigg's contributions laid some intellectual groundwork for the financial cryptography that underpins cryptocurrencies, emphasizing secure, transparent, and verifiable transactions, crucial for the functioning of decentralized financial systems like Bitcoin.

Reddit,bitcoin,I posted something similar to this two weeks ago; maybe it needs reposting a couple of times a month from now on. Or pin it somewhere.,2025-02-03 21:20:44,"If you got into Bitcoin recently, and recently bailed on this dip, and are now questioning yourself seeing it recovering… the simple advice I would have for you is that this may not be for you.

If you’re trying to scalp little intra-day or intra-week movements to scrape together a few dollars, do not bother. You are up against sophisticated people, and AI, and trading strategies that have been around for a decade. You do not have a chance playing this game, sitting in front of your screen, all optimistic and enthusiastic. Especially if you don’t have a backbone for it. If you can't handle the wild up-and-down swings, don't get on the see-saw in the first place.

If you buy-in and it goes up -- way up -- and you're congratulating yourself on being a timing genius... don't. It could just as easily have gone the other way in the exact same time frame.

Bitcoin is wildly volatile. The only right move for the vast majority of people who believe in it is buy, and buy it now. Is now a good time to buy bitcoin? Yes. The answer will always be yes. Always. As long as you’re willing to hold onto it and not bail at the first sign of uncertainty/distress.

This is not a short term play… but for those who are willing to stick it out, you are buying into a commodity with a limited supply and an unending and growing demand. You do not need a degree in economics to understand the implications. But it will be a wild ride. Stick to it. Or don't participate at all.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Barclays, one of the largest consumer banks in Europe, basically stopped working, which effectively is a freeze on the depositors' money. I would not be surprised if this is a _test_ to see how people react when their money is at stake. 

I am enjoying the scene, and some of the same morons who are blaming Barclays now, will keep saying *Bitcoin is a scam*. 


Gold has hit all time time high (again) in British pound (cannot complain, I am knee deep in bitcoin, chest deep in gold). If more people were aware of Bitcoin (as they will be, in may be five more years) can you imagine the trajectory? 

I sleep like a baby, knowing that my coins are secured by more than 20,000 running nodes (and rising every single day) world wide and guarded by a seed phrase kept secured inside a titanium box buried in an uninhabited Indonesian island. Screw the Barclays, HSBC, JP Morgan and Department of treasury, let them confiscate/nationalise/expropriate (or whatever fancy word they come up with) all the bank accounts and I could not care less. 

Guys, you have to stop obsessing with the exchange rate and see the true value of Bitcoin. That is, there is no gatekeeper between you and your coins (so long as you can connect to the internet with a secure laptop). _That_ is what makes Bitcoin unique. Christmas is gone, but next time you meet the annoying uncle for dinner who hates Bitcoin but yet brings it up, show this post. 

And yes, learn coding. No, not to work at Google, but so that you can _sign a transaction_ with your own keys and compiling your own code. That is to hedge your coins in case Trezor fails. Not to digress, but I am just assuming the gcc compilers will not disappear even if Trezor does.

My recent friend just ordered a HW wallet today and is moving his coins over soon. He's well off already so not worried about the small amount he started with being volatile but it will be fun to see how his allocation grows haha. Just like us all.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Banned From Atomic Wallet Sub. Stay away from Atomic Wallet!!,2025-02-04 10:47:22,"I started using Atomic Wallet years ago to learn about software wallets. It initially worked fine but had slower transfers than other SW I tested. I also transferred/received those free Reddit avatars without issues. However, after the well-known Atomic Wallet fiasco, many users lost money and dealt with poor customer service.

Recently, I had a post pop-up about user having BTC deposited to their wallet and obviously it was bullshit. I commented as much. Out of curiosity I decided to check my old AW account. Unsurprisingly, an ETH transfer from a year ago was still pending. I had to take a shit, so I decided to browse AW sub only to find I was permanently banned for my recent comment.

Did I do something wrong? Either way, imo, stay away from Atomic Wallet!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Kodo Exchange Designed to be the core of Taiko's liquidity,",2025-02-04 11:07:36,"what is kodo exchange  
Kodo exchange is a ve(3,3) Decentralized exchange available on taikos network similar to the like of aerodrome and velodrome for their respective networks as a ve(3,3) DEX, users can lock their KODO for veKODO, which grants them governance power, trading fee rewards, and weekly rebases that increase their locked balance over time. This system encourages long-term participation while ensuring that those who commit to the platform have a direct influence on where incentives go.

Liquidity providers can add funds to liquidity pools, stake their LP tokens, and earn KODO emissions. But instead of emissions being distributed inefficiently, veKODO holders vote on which pools receive KODO rewards, ensuring that incentives flow to the most valuable and active liquidity pools. Additionally, protocols looking to attract liquidity can offer bribes, rewarding veKODO holders for directing emissions to their pools.

There's also the rebase mechanism, which adjusts the veKODO supply weekly based on how much KODO is locked. The more KODO that is locked, the greater the rebase rewards for veKODO holders. This system helps make emissions more sustainable over time, as higher locking rates reduce circulating supply and strengthen veKODO incentives.

Kodo also runs on a weekly epoch system, meaning emissions and rewards update on a set schedule (every Thursday). This cycle ensures that liquidity incentives, trading fees, and governance votes align efficiently, creating a self-reinforcing flywheel where liquidity, emissions, and governance interact dynamically to drive platform growth.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Not Selling, Not Buying—Just Watching This Storm",2025-02-03 12:23:40,"
I’m riding out this sea of red, but I’m not buying either. I got into crypto mining on a small scale back in 2020, made a few purchases around the ATH, and—like many—hesitated when the dips came.

And that’s okay. You don’t always have to feel pressured to “buy the dip” if it’s not the right move for you. Crypto is still a largely speculative asset, and it’s easy to fall into the sunk cost fallacy—throwing more money in just because you already have skin in the game.

I did manage to take some profits, selling about half of my holdings at the most recent ATH—not a huge sum by some standards, but enough to pull out my initial investment. I kept that in stablecoin, waiting for a clearer picture. With these new tariffs hitting, i’m even less inclined to keep money in US exchanges. Obviously a hardware wallet or at least self-custodial is best, but I’d wager that the majority of people here are still just sitting in an exchange.

Now, sure, people will say I should be buying this dip, and they might be right. But with so much global uncertainty, I’d rather have liquidity than gamble on timing a rebound.

Remember: If you never take profits, you risk getting caught out. Your portfolio isn’t worth its last personal ATH—it’s only worth what someone is willing to buy it for when you sell.

Be smart. Even if this ends up being an amazing investment opportunity, prices can always go lower, and recoveries can take years. Don’t make emotional decisions, don’t panic sell in the red, and don’t fall for FOMO.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Relax, this is not the end. Only the beginning",2025-02-02 19:40:59,"
Haven’t posted on here in recent years but I’ve been involved in crypto since around 2017 and believe I have a pretty good understanding. I’ll start by telling you how I believe all of this will play out. For the time being I believe we will continue to drop for today or hold steady, I do not think this downtrend will continue into the entire week. Quite the opposite actually, I believe by the end of this week we will be back in an upward trend and that will be the beginning of the real alt coin rally. I believe bitcoin is done for the most part for this cycle, it may reach a new high, but just barely. I’d be surprised to see it reach above 115,000 this cycle. 

Now the rest of what I am about to say is going to be more of stretch but I believe it will play out this way to some degree in the coming weeks or even next week. Trump, Canada, and all parties involved in this tariff conversation will reach a more agreeable solution and markets will react accordingly. There will be a solution to all of the issues the above mentioned parties have created, as if they did not create them in the first place. All of their friends and people in the know will have scooped everything people are currently panic selling and already be in a great deal of profit by end of next week. 

This next part is an even bigger stretch, I believe we will get some sort of crypto specific catalyst - specifically clarity from the US this coming week or next that will further push this alt coin rally. 

With all of that being said, the one thing I am sure of is that this is not the end of the alt coin market for this cycle. The other thing that I am actually 100% certain of is that nobody knows what will actually happen and how things will play out, obviously myself included. However, I am willing to put my money where my mouth is, if the crypto market is not in a better position on the 16th of this month than it currently is then I will donate $1000 dollars to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital with proof. I invite any doom and gloom people or anyone with enough conviction to take me up on this and donate $10 dollars to St. Jude if I am in fact correct and we are in a better place come the 16th. 

None of this is financial advice and I believe everyone should do their own research and come to their own conclusions. ",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

I fear that Trump’s continued games with the economy and government will cause faith in the dollar to decline sharply, leading to people to start looking at other solutions. Bitcoin is an obvious choice, and while it’s hardened against bad actors, it still lacks enough privacy to be a true replacement for cash. This is probably going to be important if the administration decides to use this information against people they don’t like. Eventually people will want something that keeps their transactions private.

I’m no shill for Monero at all, I basically ignored all my crypto holdings after 2022. In fact, this is the first crypto I’ve purchased since then. But, I see this is a practical use of cryptocurrency for the average person when we have a hostile government in power. The more that average people use these for legal purposes, the more legitimacy it will have as a currency instead of a money laundering or drug dealing tool.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Tell me your opinion (venting allowed as well),2025-02-03 09:26:01,"
Hey fellow degens,  I know no one knows what will happen and I dont need any condolences and sympathy for my portfolio, because I didn't break the first crypto rule: Dont invest what you can't lose. 

I will start with my opinion:
First of all, I'm in since 2017,so I saw a lot happening in this time, doesn't mean I'm a pro tho. I think what happens now is pretty similar to the trade war 2019 which probably wasn't that popular tho. We all know what happened between 2020 and 2025. Lots of people got good gains with crypto and / or stocks. So what I'm trying to say is, that this probably could happen the same way now. What happens for shure is, more and more people get to know about crypto, i guess that cant be bad. Maybe I will try to buy the dip when the knive has fallen all the way till the end. Maybe I just sit and watch.


I just want to know in YOUR OPINION what is going to happen until March 31. Just for some discussion that's all. Pls stay friendly - we don't need hate on the inside of the crypto community. ",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

A couple of days ago I saw some posts on X about a Wallet-to-wallet DM.

You can imagine my interest, send DM's to wallets? How would that work? 

Link to [X post](https://x.com/Hypes_Zone/status/1883650172695236678). These guys are not only trying to do wallet-to-wallet DM, but they are even adding API's to their project.

This got met thinking, let's say you just launched a token, and want to reach out every token holder. Just send them a DM. No need for X or twitter. No need for any of them to follow you. Just a direct message to the holders. Even if some sell off, you will automatically remove them from the list. 

Even making groups of type of holders... This thing is awesome. I'm following them closely.

Did you rotate into equities? Buy a house? New car? New Wife?

One thing I’ve learned from these bull runs since 2018 (and that’s relatively late compared to some of you old school lot), is that taking profits when everyone is shouting “bullrun” is never a bad idea.

If you follow the cycles properly, buy in the bear at lows, then you don’t feel as bad selling some when prices are high.

Me personally, I paid off some credit card debt (which feels awesome) and bought a lovely 2nd hand RV (or motorhome we call them in Europe). I still have a small amount of BTC just in case but very much looking forward to the buying up cheap SATs when time are rough for the market.

Things I’ve learned:

- take profit, it feels good! There are just as many good opportunities in stocks as there are for crypto.

- Keep some (fake) SATs in a tax free account. Then some proper BTC in a wallet for long term HODL.

- Sell when everybody is euphoric.

- Use Bitcoin (and crypto) as a means to an end. We are not on this Earth long, so use it to better your life.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,If you buy BTC on Fidelity and it 2x but they then close your account with unsold crypto...,2025-02-03 02:08:34," ..do they owe you the full amount of your crypto investment + profit, or only your initial investment?

You would think the answer is obvious.

Im asking because Fidelity closed an investment account of mine (i had stocks, ETFs that i already sold right before they closed my account along with my unsold crypto) and when they sent me a check for the total amount in my Fidelity account, for the crypto portion they only included my original crypto investment -- despite the fact that my crypto investment had 2x from original purchase amount. I had purchased that crypto over a year prior to them closing my account.

Do they not owe me?


Edit 1: i know i will be asked why they closed my account. Idk, they wouldn't tell me except to tell me they dont have to tell me.

My guess is that i triggered some AI fraud algorithm when i dumped all my holdings (except the crypto obviously) and tried to transfer everything to my bank. I never had an issue transferring anything before, to and from the bank account in question. Tried twice, both were cancelled. Tried to then transfer to my business checking, failed again and account was disabled. This Fidelity account was a few years old.

Edit 2: No this was not the first time ive bought crypto, first time doing it on Fidelity.  Ive dealt with only exchanges prior and thought i would toss a few $ into my Fidelity crypto for the hell of it.

If I had been smart and taken profits in December I wouldn't be emotional now, but I didn't. ""Face melting alt season gains blah blah blah"" held me back from taking profits which was a huge mistake.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

It then says that:

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-02-04 12:19:06.748666

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
