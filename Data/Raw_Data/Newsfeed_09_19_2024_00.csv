Although these concerns were eased with a subsequent bounce to $2,460 on September 13, Ethereum remains largely in a downtrend, with a triple-bottom price formation now shaping up. Interestingly, this triple bottom formation is not new for Ethereum. As technical analysis points out, the current price action seems to repeat a similar playout in mid-2021.   Ethereum Fractal Suggests Rally In Q4 According to a technical analysis by crypto analyst CryptoBullet on social media platform X, Ethereum is shaping up to form a triple bottom price formation on the 1D candlestick time frame. While the third bottom has yet to be fully completed, the analyst draws attention to a similar pattern that unfolded between June and August 2021. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 During those three months, Ethereum’s price fluctuated up and down to create three distinct lows just above the $1,675 mark. After the third low was established, Ethereum experienced a significant bullish rally that propelled it to break through and establish its current all-time high. This upward movement became even more pronounced after a fractal pattern emerged in August 2021, signaling a strong momentum shift. Recent market dynamics have prompted Ethereum to create two bottoms of around $2,150 in August and September. Interestingly, a recent rejection at the $2,450 resistance has seen Ethereum pushing on a decline. This has prompted analyst CryptoBullet to highlight the possibility of a third low in October, thereby completing the triple bottom formation. Price formations in cryptocurrency markets are known to repeat over time, often following patterns that can help traders anticipate future movements. While no two market conditions are exactly the same, studying past price movements provides valuable insights into what may happen in the future. A similar playout of the 2021 price action puts on a similar surge for Ethereum in Q4 2024. Notably, the analyst envisioned a rally towards the $3,700 price level.  What’s Next For ETH? At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,320 and continues to exhibit a weak short-term outlook. If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,340 resistance, it could start another decline towards $2,150.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Competitor FLOKI Forms Falling Wedge That Could Trigger 54% Breakout This weak performance and outlook are even more pronounced compared with Bitcoin. As such, Ethereum/Bitcoin is now at its lowest level since April 2021, a staggering 41-month low. Most of this lackluster action has also been exacerbated by selloffs from a few large holders. For instance, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently came under scrutiny for selling $2.2 million worth of Ethereum.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

This underperformance has raised concerns among investors, with many worried about Solana’s inability to keep up with the market’s recent surge.  Related Reading: XRP ‘The Safest Investment To Make 100% ROI’ – Former Asset Manager Shares Price Targets Some analysts are even predicting a deep retrace to its yearly low of around $78 if the price continues to lag. Despite holding relatively well during Bitcoin’s and other altcoins’ earlier crashes, Solana’s current price action suggests that the risk of a correction is growing.  If SOL fails to break above $140 and align with the market’s recovery, it could face a steeper downturn. While Solana previously weathered market turbulence better than some of its peers, there’s a growing belief that now may be Solana’s turn to experience a significant fall. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming movements. Solana Struggling To Keep Bullish Momentum Solana (SOL) has retraced over 7% this week, while many other altcoins surged, posting double-digit gains. This raised concerns among investors, who fear SOL might follow the same trajectory many altcoins experienced in recent months. One prominent analyst and former asset manager, Amdtrades, with over 9 years of experience, shared a technical analysis of Solana’s price action, highlighting some concerning price targets. According to Amdtrades, Solana is at a crucial crossroads. If it fails to break past the $140 resistance level—a fundamental price point that once served as strong support—a deep correction could follow. He noted that the first key level to watch is $115, which could trigger further downside if breached. After that, SOL could drop to $100; in a worst-case scenario, it may fall as low as $78. If it drops to the lower prices, it would represent a 40% correction from current levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Monthly Downtrend: Can DOGE Reach $12? The risk of Solana hitting these lows remains high, especially if it continues to struggle while other cryptocurrencies recover. However, Amdtrades also emphasized the potential for a rebound. Should SOL break and hold above $140, it could spark a recovery and possibly reverse the negative trend. Investors are now carefully watching these levels to see if Solana will face a deeper pullback or find the strength to regain momentum. SOL Price Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $130, a crucial level that could determine its next move. After testing the $140 resistance, the price faced a 7% rejection, raising concerns among traders. The $140 mark coincides with the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $139.26, a significant technical indicator that had provided support since October last year but has now flipped to resistance. This reversal has created added pressure on SOL bulls to regain control. SOL must break above this EMA and reclaim the $140 level for a bullish reversal. If bulls succeed, it would clear negative market sentiment and likely trigger an aggressive 20% surge toward the next supply zone around $163. However, failure to reclaim these levels could lead to a more bearish outcome.

In the last week, SUI registered an impressive 33% rally, pushing the price up to $1.18 at press time. This is getting people wondering whether the token is preparing for a longer ascent, as many are waiting for key levels that might influence the situation. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $92,000 ‘Bounce’ In 3 Months, Analyst Predicts Price forecast for the altcoin predicts significant increase in the next few months. A strong upswing could propel the SUI to soar by 245% in the following three months. The price chart of SUI shows a sequence of higher highs and lower lows, which confirms this view—textbook evidence of optimistic momentum. SUI has gradually climbed from a low of $0.60 early this year, passing through several resistance zones along the way. Bullish Trend Signals Strength SUI’s price movement indicates that bullish sentiment is gathering steam. The token’s capacity to breach resistance zones points to perhaps more fuel left for the rally. Market observers are closely monitoring the next significant resistance level at $1.2047. Should SUI exceed this barrier, the following targets should lie between $1.50 and $1.80. While the support held high at $1.125, a firmer layer of support is observed at $1.045. The battle is on between the bulls and the bears, but the momentum seems to be on the side of the bulls. What would be the final test is whether they can push SUI past these resistance levels to trigger another round of buying. Volume And Open Interest On The Rise Supporting the bullish outlook is the increase in volume and open interest. Data from Coinglass shows the trading volume of SUI has risen 3.25% to $1.83 billion while open interest is up 11.85% at $331 million. This rising trade volume indicates growing interest in this token,. With the increasing engagement, people seem to have big confidence in the short-term prospects of SUI. With these uptrends, the market sentiment is going strongly on a roll to sustain this rally. Technical signals and trading activities are showing good numbers for SUI bulls. Price Predictions Show Optimism The three-month prediction on price for SUI is quite optimistic. Analysts predict the coin rising 245.86% over the next three months. This would signify a massive rise from its present levels, indicating important momentum to be seen within the market and investors. Further ahead, the six-month projection is estimated to increase by 180.47% while the one-year outlook will hike by 166.62%. Related Reading: The Sandbox (SAND) Sets Sights On 1,111% Growth Amid Crypto Market Pressures These numbers suggest that SUI might continue posting steady gains in the medium and long run, despite being traded at 228% below estimates in the next month, suggesting optimism is still around it. Investors are waiting and on the lookout for when SUI will cross past these key levels, which may unlock and open up better prospects for the future. The coin is drawing further attention as it moves with bullish technical signals coupled with increasing volume and positive price forecasts. It may be about to embark on a protracted rally considering the current position of the token, where it has managed to breach the strong resistance levels of around $0.016.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin All-Time High Only A Month Away After Breaking $60,000",2024-09-18 19:30:05+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be gearing up for a new All-Time High (ATH) this year if it breaks through key resistance levels at $60,000. Despite experiencing substantial volatility and price instability over the past few months, analysts express bullish optimism for the cryptocurrency in the coming months.  New Bitcoin All-Time High Incoming The Bitcoin price chart is flashing bullish signals as the cryptocurrency is up above $60,000 once again. Earlier this month, Bitcoin jumped over the $60,000 mark but witnessed a minor correction that pushed its price back below $59,000.  Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Enters Stage 3 That Will Trigger 4,500% Rally To $15 With the cryptocurrency recovering its previous momentum, many analysts expect more gains in the future. In an X (formerly Twitter) post on September 17, popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe suggested that as long as Bitcoin can maintain a steady price above $58,500, the market will remain strong and positive, signaling the possible start of the bull market. Based on his price chart of Bitcoin’s movements, the $58,500 price mark is seen as a critical support area to hold and Poppe has predicted that if Bitcoin continues to trade above this level, it could experience a massive pump to new all-time highs in October 2024. This significant price increase is anticipated to surpass Bitcoin’s current ATH, which jumped above $73,000 in March 2024.  At the time, the trigger to Bitcoin achieving its March ATH was the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the subsequent large-scale demand. This time, BTC is expected to reach a new ATH, catalyzed by a confluence of factors, including the fact that Q4 of all Bitcoin halving years is typically seen as a bullish period for the cryptocurrency.  Before this attack on the ATH in October, Poppe revealed that Bitcoin may experience a “sweep of the liquidity” as well as a short period of consolidation. The analyst highlighted that September remains a significantly weak month for Bitcoin, characterized by price declines and volatility.  However, he has forecasted that BTC could witness a clear breakout to the upside above $62,000 by the end of the month, or in early October. As of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,471, marking a 3.76% price increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  Next Three Months Seen As Bullish Period For BTC Bitcoin has been in a long downtrend, with Q3 seen as one of its most bearish periods this year. Despite the cryptocurrency’s price crash and previously persistent declines, analysts highlight that the coming months will be significantly bullish for the cryptocurrency.  Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 Crypto analyst, Crypto Rover disclosed on X that September has historically been the worst month for Bitcoin, however, he believes Q4 is set to be the best.  Other analysts like ‘Stockmoney Lizards’ foresee Bitcoin hitting a whopping $100,000 price target by year’s end, with expectations that Q4 (between October to December) would significantly push the cryptocurrency to the upside.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Following the announcement, the markets reacted with notable volatility. Bullish Outlook For Bitcoin Just moments ago, the Fed disclosed its decision to reduce the federal funds rate by 0.50 percentage points (bps) for the first time in four years, marking a pivotal shift since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This adjustment lowers the target range to 4.75% to 5%, down from 5.25% to 5.5%, which had been in place since last July—the highest rates seen since 2001. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Rally Predicted For Next 6 Months After Fed Rate Cut Analysts had widely anticipated this cut, with some, including crypto analyst Doctor Profit, asserting that a 50 bps reduction would be bullish for Bitcoin and the wider digital asset ecosystem in the short term.  Market expert Michael Van de Poppe has also indicated that volatility is likely to increase for both Bitcoin and Ethereum following this event, but in the end, this would potentially drive prices higher. BTC’s Reaction To Fed’s Rate Cut Following the Fed’s announcement, Bitcoin has exhibited considerable volatility, marked by aggressive price movements.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Dogecoin Miners In Accumulation Mode, But Is This Really Bullish?",2024-09-18 18:00:29+00:00,"On-chain data shows the Dogecoin miners have been accumulating recently. Here’s what this could mean for the memecoin, based on past pattern. Dogecoin Miner Supply Has Been Going Up For A While Now In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the role of the miners in the different cryptocurrency markets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply held by Miners,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total amount of tokens that the miners of a network as a whole are carrying in their balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Toughest Time Over: Why Q4 Could Be A Game-Changer When the value of this indicator goes up, it means the miners are receiving net deposits into their wallets right now. Such a trend implies this cohort may be in a phase of accumulation. On the other hand, the metric registering a decline suggests these chain validators are withdrawing a net number of tokens from their balance, potentially for selling purposes. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply held by Miners for Bitcoin over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Supply held by Miners and the Bitcoin price has shown some correlation during the past year. As Santiment has explained in the post: When miners choose to hold onto their coins rather than selling, it’s often a sign that they expect prices to rise, which can create positive momentum in the market. However, when they start offloading large amounts, it can put downward pressure on prices. Most recently, the BTC Supply held by Miners has been on the rise again after plunging to relatively low levels earlier. Thus, it would appear that these chain validators may be accumulating once more, which can be bullish for the asset. The relationship that miners show to the BTC price is similar to many other cryptocurrency networks. However, that is not the case with meme coins like Dogecoin. According to the analytics firm: If it’s a very speculative-driven asset, you can often pick up an inverse indication between what miners are doing and where the altcoin is going price-wise compared to Bitcoin. The inverse relationship is visible in the below chart for the Dogecoin Supply held by Miners. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Dogecoin Supply held by Miners had plunged back in January, but what followed this selloff from the miners was a sharp surge in the DOGE/BTC ratio. Related Reading: Altcoin Watch: Mega Whales Are Taking These Alts Off Exchanges Over the last couple of months, the chain validators of the asset have seen their supply register a rapid increase. Given the inverse relationship the metric and the price tend to follow, however, this accumulation could be a bearish sign for the asset. DOGE Price Dogecoin had made recovery beyond the $0.107 mark earlier, but the memecoin has since gone downhill as it’s back at $0.100.

This bullishness bled to the altcoin market, prompting many tokens to follow the trend. Nervos (CKB) is one of those tokens that experienced astonishing growth with a 120% uptick, outperforming the broader market.  Related Reading: Avalanche Revenue Nosedives Over 40% In Q2 – Impact On AVAX Price Although CKB’s gains in the short term have been great, the long-term implications of such price movements are still important for investors and traders. The market’s current bullishness might continue for the broader community, but CKB’s performance long-term might be in question.  Nervos: Breakthrough Halted By Resistance  The token has gained control of the $0.015 support level for an attempted breakthrough on the $0.0198 resistance. However, the latter has held its ground against the bulls in the short term, potentially putting the gains made in the past few days in jeopardy.  CKB’s position in the short term is threatened by this rejection as the token’s trajectory might push CKB well below its $0.015 support level. If this occurs, it will represent a sudden flip in the short-term outlook of investors and traders.  The relative strength index (RSI) gives a clue as to where the token is heading. As of writing, the RSI points to a majority bull market for CKB, pushing the narrative that the token will continue upward. It also shows that the momentum of CKB’s market is on the side of the bulls.  If the token continues to get rejected by this crucial resistance level, the token’s momentum will eventually side with the bears flipping gains to losses. Once this occurs, CKB’s trajectory will touchdown on $0.0114 in the short term.  Nervos Network (CKB) Market Support ✅ Supported Market: KRW, BTC, USDT Market 📅 Trading opens at: 2024-09-13 17:00 KST (estimated time) 🔗 Discover more:https://t.co/Zys7A2zGTj#Upbit #CKB pic.twitter.com/V6vdR8CVG8 — Upbit Korea (@Official_Upbit) September 13, 2024 Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Climbs 20% – Here’s What’s Pushing The Price Up Upbit Lists CKB Trading Pairs And Other Developments This Week Upbit’s official X accounts have announced this week that CKB is now supported on the trading platform.

This move indicates a cautious approach in the market, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to announce its latest interest rate decision later today by 2 pm ET Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Key Insights into Bitcoin’s Bull-Bear Transition Phase The Looming Rate Cut And The Beforemath So far, current market sentiment points towards a 50 basis-point rate cut, a significant change from the usual monetary policy. This would be the first-rate reduction in four years, causing market participants to brace for potential volatility. Zimmerman noted that CME traders have notably increased their short positions by 5,500 BTC over the past two days, pushing futures premiums to a nine-month low. This trend suggests a shift towards bearish sentiment on Bitcoin in anticipation of the FOMC’s decision. Additionally, the CME futures market is reflecting fears of heightened volatility, similar to what occurred following the recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. According to Zimmerman, the “downward sloping futures premiums” on CME, now below 5% for the first time since January 15, indicate “hedging against potential risks” associated with the FOMC meeting. Implications Of Interest Rate Cuts On Bitcoin Zimmerman pointed out that although rate cuts usually relief market conditions and may enhance liquidity for risk assets like Bitcoin, worries about a possible economic downturn remain. The analyst mentioned that the anticipated 50 basis-point cut has amplified these concerns. Historical precedents show that such a significant reduction, like those in 2001 and 2007, heightened recession fears. Currently, with real interest rates at their cyclical highs and inflation cooling, the Federal Reserve may consider swift cuts to reach a “neutral rate”—a rate that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy, Zimmerman suggested. The analyst added, noting: “Currently, 125 basis points in cuts are expected by the end of the year.” Currently, Bitcoin trades at $59,415, at the time of writing down by 2.7% in the past day. Despite the bearish sentiment from CME traders, several analysts are optimistic that the fed rate cut will be positive for Bitcoin.

The FTM price recovery is thanks to Fantom’s fundamentals, which have sparked a positive sentiment among investors.  What Is Driving The FTM Price Recovery Fantom’s price recovery is mainly driven by its bullish fundamentals, especially the imminent launch of the Sonic network. In a recent blog post, Sonic Labs announced that Sonic’s launch is scheduled for November/December 2024. Investors consider Fantom’s transition to Sonic bullish, which explains why they are investing in the FTM ecosystem ahead of the launch.  Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Enters Stage 3 That Will Trigger 4,500% Rally To $15 According to the announcement, the layer-1 network Sonic will be EVM-compatible, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) built on other EVM chains to be integrated into the network easily. The network will provide a secure gateway to Ethereum through its layer-2 network.  The post also claimed that Sonic will provide the “fastest settlement layer for digital assets with over 10,000 TPS and one-second confirmation times for transactions ” upon launch. This feat will set a new standard in the blockchain space and put Sonic ahead of its competitors.  Meanwhile, following Sonic’s launch, there will be an airdrop, which will cause more liquidity to flow into the Fantom ecosystem and further spark the FTM price recovery. The Sonic Foundation will airdrop 190 million S tokens out of its 500 million treasury to Fantom users.  It is worth mentioning that FTM holders can swap their coins 1:1 for the S token, Sonic’s native token, upon the launch of the new layer-1 network. Meanwhile, the S token will not experience any inflation in the first six months, which is positive since investors can rest assured that there won’t be a supply shock following Fantom’s transition to Sonic.  Other bullish fundamentals sparking the FTM price recovery include the fact that Andre Cronje, Sonic Labs’s co-founder, will build new decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives, with 90% of gas spent said to be going back to applications and developers.  The Charts Also Support Fantom’s Bullish Fundamentals Crypto analyst Jagoilio recently highlighted how the charts support the FTM price recovery, with the coin likely to rise higher. He stated that Fantom has moved past its bearish trend and is now looking to break its diagonal resistance. He added that this presents the notion that the crypto is enforcing a bullish market structure and seeking a higher high. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 The analyst expects Fantom to enjoy a massive price rally in the fourth quarter, especially following the Fed rate cuts and the US presidential elections. Jagoilio went as far as asserting that FTM can outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum. He also claimed that Sonic will become the supreme layer-1 solution and outperform Solana.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, FTM is trading at around $0.57 at the time of writing, up over 9% in the last 24 hours.   Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Chainlink Signals Deeper Losses: Can Bulls Stage A Comeback?,2024-09-18 13:30:45+00:00,"Chainlink is facing increasing bearish pressure as its price continues to edge lower, signalling a potential move toward the further downside. After a period of consolidation, the bears have regained control, pushing Chainlink closer toward the $9.28 support level.  However, bulls may not be ready to give up just yet. With market sentiment fluctuating, the possibility of a bullish comeback looms on the horizon. By examining key technical indicators and market sentiment, we seek to determine if LINK is poised for a deeper decline or if bullish forces could reverse the current trend and drive the price upward. At the time of writing, Chainlink was trading around $10.59, marking a 0.10% decline over the past day. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization stood at approximately $6.4 billion, while trading volume exceeded $206 million, showing increases of 0.10% and 15.36%, respectively. Current Market Sentiment: Bearish Pressure Mounts On Chainlink On the 4-hour chart, following a successful drop below the $11 mark, LINK has continued to experience negative momentum, dropping toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). As the cryptocurrency approaches the 100-day SMA, it could either find temporary support or risk further declines if the bearish momentum continues to intensify. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart, has dropped below the 50% threshold, now sitting at 42%. With the RSI attempting to move deeper into the oversold territory, it shows that bears are gaining control, and an extended decrease could be on the horizon if buying interest does not pick up soon. Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest On the daily chart, Chainlink is currently making a bearish movement, toward the $7.14 trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average. This movement underscores strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, signaling a heightened risk of further losses. Lastly, the 1-day RSI reflects increasing pessimistic pressure on LINK, as the indicator has fallen to 47% after briefly crossing above the 50% threshold. This drop highlights mounting selling activity and signals a stronger potential for additional downward movement. Will LINK See A Recovery Or Further Decline? As the cryptocurrency approaches the $9.28 support level, which could spark a potential rebound, technical indicators like the RSI still point to strong selling pressure. If LINK fails to hold this level, a break below could result in persistent declines, potentially testing the $7.14 support level and even lower thresholds. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Could Drop To $8 If It Loses Current Support: On-Chain Data Reveals However, should Chainlink manage to hold above this crucial support level, it could set the stage for a potential upward move toward the $11.10 resistance. A successful breakout through this resistance could ignite a significant rally, paving the way for the price to aim for the next key resistance at $12.44. If bullish momentum continues to build, Chainlink may even reach higher levels, extending the rally beyond current resistance points.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-19 20:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

I just wanted to share my thoughts on the recent upgrade to TokenSight’s UI and how it’s seriously impacted my trading performance. The new interface is not just a cosmetic change; it’s a game-changer in how I approach my trades.

First off, the fresh design is super intuitive—navigating through the platform feels effortless. I’ve noticed that the new cross-chain bridge feature is a massive time-saver. Being able to move native and stable tokens with just one click has made onboarding to new chains a breeze. This kind of versatility is crucial in today’s fast-paced trading environment!

The Token Discovery feature is another highlight for me. Having curated lists of valuable on-chain information right at my fingertips has helped me make more informed decisions and, dare I say, safer bets. It’s so much easier to stay ahead of trends and identify promising tokens.

And let’s not forget about the portfolio management improvements! Keeping track of assets across different chains and wallets used to be a headache, but now it feels seamless. Plus, with the faster trading engine, executing trades is quicker than ever, allowing me to seize opportunities in real-time.

Overall, this upgrade has elevated my trading journey and made me more confident in my decisions. I’m curious to hear how others are experiencing the new UI! Have you found any specific features that have improved your trading performance? Let’s discuss! 💬",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075
Reddit,solana,Crypto market cycles: timing your trades for maximum gains on Solana,2024-09-18 13:46:23,"Understanding the phases of crypto market cycles is something every new trader should learn about right away. These cycles are different from traditional trading, and its similarities can be recognized as hints at times. It can be summarized in 4 cycles:

* **Accumulation phase:** Prices are low, and is where some traders start buying.
* **Markup phase:** Prices begin to rise, attracting more buyers and increasing market activity.
* **Distribution phase:** Early investors sell their holdings to lock in profits as prices peak.
* **Markdown phase:** Prices fall as more investors start selling off their assets.

**General tips for trading:**

* Buy during the accumulation phase to position yourself early for potential gains.
* Take advantage of rising prices during the markup phase.
* Secure profits during the distribution phase to capitalize on market highs.
* Mitigate losses during the markdown phase by reducing exposure.

Note: No financial advice. 

Additionally, using stop-loss orders and automation can help in staying ahead of this fast-pace market.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Here’s what I have:

However, when I check Photon-SOL, the price is 0.0₉6864.

* **Return on investment (ROI):** Evaluate your profits and losses to assess the performance of your trading.
* **Win rate:** Measure the percentage of profitable trades to feel the effectiveness of your trading strategy and of your signals as well.
* **Average profit and loss:** Analyzing your average gains and losses per trade gives insight into your trading performance per trade and helps in adjusting your smart money trading strategies as well as your risk management.
* **Risk-to-reward ratio:** Compare the potential profit of a trade to its risk. A favorable ratio, such as 2:1, indicates a higher potential reward compared to the risk involved.
* **Trading volume:** The volume of a token helps to understand market liquidity, which can influence price movements, especially in popular memecoins.
* **Market sentiment:** What is the overall mood of the world and of the crypto space? How does the news and the socials are talking about the state of where the industry is? Take it with a grain of salt considering that it’s not all that matters.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,solana,Accidentally sent JupSOL to a CEX (Tokocrypto),2024-09-17 09:44:33,"GM,

I made a mistake and sent JupSOL to my Tokocrypto wallet (a CEX like Binance). Since JupSOL isn't listed on their exchange, the tokens aren't showing up in my balance. I reached out to support, but they’re telling me the funds can’t be retrieved.

I'm surprised by this response since it doesn’t seem too complex for them to access my SOL wallet and return the tokens. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? Is there anything else I can do to recover my funds?

Reddit,solana,Do you also think things are looking good with Picasso on the development side? 🤔,2024-09-17 14:32:19,"Cross-chain DeFi isn't just a word, it's going viral with its seamless liquidity across different networks/blockchains. So far, it runs on over 100+ chains, and lots of dapps. 

I know Picasso integrates the IBC protocol, connecting Solana, Cosmos, Ethereum, Polkadot, and eventually Bitcoin. Maybe more, who knows. DeFi on Bitcoin is totally becoming a thing. All down for that.

Well, I've seen a couple of partnerships brew. Strong VCs. I'm less concerned about the PICA price at the moment. I know that this could be a big project as time goes on.

I'm not part of the team but I've also seen some strong marketing plans being revealed, which I've noticed other top projects do as well to become successful. Maybe this is why I'm still all in on this. I think PICA could easily hit $1 someday.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,solana,How does burning appear in TX log?,2024-09-17 15:08:26,"Hey all, 

  So I came across a project that's burning 70% of its supply at set intervals as the market cap grows but even after owner burned tokens and I watched mc jump up 120% I only saw what appeared to be large purchases in TX log. However, after checking TX hash on solscan, it showed the tokens were burned which was slightly confusing..

  Even though burning has been around for ages, a token burn schedule like this is fairly new to me and the crypto space from what I can tell. So, have any of you noticed TX hashes for token burns in TX logs before and if so, do they appear as purchases when burned or do they appear at all? It would obviously increase market cap with less supply but how it's reflected in TX log, I'm not certain of

Ie: Wade burned 1% at 100k mc = 1k buy in TX log
Wade Burned 1% at 200k mc = 2k buy in TX log
Wade Burned 1% at 300k mc = 3k buy in TX log
Wade Burned 1% at 400k mc = 4k buy in log 

I didn't catch the 300k and 400k ones but saw the insane boost to mc, went pretty fast from 150k to 400k after burns.. but saw TX for similar (to 1%) buys when mc jumped and burns happened.

Or, does burn appear in TX log at all?

# Solana Pushes Forward with Professional Education and Network Optimization

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, Solana continues to make strides in both education and network efficiency. The latest Solana Changelog, featuring Nick from the Solana Foundation DevRel team and Mike, brings to light several exciting developments that are set to enhance the Solana ecosystem.

## Professional Education: Empowering the Next Generation of Solana Developers

Solana has taken a significant leap in blockchain education with the introduction of a comprehensive professional education repository. This initiative is designed to equip organizations and individuals with the tools necessary to train others on Solana's technology.

""This is something that we're really starting to push out to existing organizations,"" Mike explained. ""Anyone who wants to be able to train other people on Solana, we have not just the content, but the instructor notes, the example code, the guides to run events, anything that any external organization could need to train people on Solana and just hit the ground running and go.""

The repository, available on GitHub, offers a range of educational resources tailored for different time commitments:

* One-hour introductory sessions
* One-day intensive workshops
* A full four-day training course (which can be adapted into a 12-week program)

This versatile approach ensures that learners at various levels of expertise can find suitable content to enhance their Solana development skills. The initiative demonstrates Solana's commitment to growing its developer community and fostering innovation within its ecosystem.

## Updating Educational Content: Keeping Pace with Rapid Changes

Recognizing the rapid pace of change in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, Solana has also undertaken a significant effort to update its existing educational content. All the material previously hosted on Solana.com has been redirected and is undergoing a comprehensive review and update process.

""A couple of the older courses we've noticed were a little bit out of date,"" Nick pointed out. ""They were made a couple of years ago. Anchor updates, Solana updates, a lot of things changing crypto in a small amount of time.""

To address this, Solana has engaged a talented group from Super Team to revise and modernize the course content. This team, including notable contributors like Cythecota, Manuel, Sam, Woor, and Jimmy, is working diligently to ensure that all example code works with the current versions of Solana tools and popular frameworks like React.

This update process is crucial for maintaining the relevance and accuracy of Solana's educational resources. It ensures that developers learning Solana are working with the most up-to-date information and best practices, which is essential in the fast-paced world of blockchain development.

## Stack Exchange: A Thriving Community Resource

The Solana Stack Exchange continues to be a vibrant hub of knowledge-sharing and problem-solving within the community. The changelog highlighted the top contributors for the week, with Jimmy taking the lead.

""Jimmy was actually top on the Stack Exchange leaderboard this week,"" Nick mentioned, emphasizing the importance of community-driven support.

Other notable contributors included Nara Vane, Mohammed Saeed, FE2, and John C. Fan. The active participation on Stack Exchange demonstrates the strong sense of community within the Solana ecosystem, where developers are eager to help each other overcome challenges and share insights.

## RPC 2.0: A Major Upgrade Requiring Developer Attention

One of the most significant updates discussed in the changelog is the impending release of Solana RPC version 2.0, specifically Agave RPC version 2.0. This update brings with it a number of changes that developers need to be aware of and prepare for.

""All the deprecated RPC methods and things are going to be moved to need to make sure you're going through and updating your code if you're using anything that's marked deprecated,"" Nick warned.

Mike elaborated on some of the specific changes:

* getConfirmedBlocks  
 is now getBlocks
* getConfirmedTransaction  
 is now getSignatureStatus

These changes are part of a broader effort to improve the naming conventions and functionality of the RPC methods. While the updates are generally seen as positive and more intuitive, they do require developers to update their existing code to ensure compatibility.

""A lot of these have been marked deprecated for a while, but now it's actually happening,"" Mike emphasized. ""Now is the time to go through and replace all those calls. It's a pretty easy change. You just need to do it.""

To assist developers in this transition, some RPC providers are proactively reaching out to customers who are heavily using the soon-to-be-deprecated calls. This proactive approach helps ensure a smoother transition for the entire ecosystem.

## Compute Unit Optimization: SIMD-172 Proposal

Perhaps the most impactful development discussed in the changelog is the SIMD-172 proposal, aimed at reducing the default compute unit (CU) per instruction. This proposal has significant implications for network efficiency and validator economics.

Currently, transactions that do not specify a custom compute budget default to 200,000 compute units per instruction. This often results in wasted compute resources and less optimized blocks. The SIMD-172 proposal introduces a tiered system to address this inefficiency.

Nick explained the proposed changes:

* Initially, the default will be reduced from 200,000 CUs to 20,000 CUs.
* After a period of time, the default will be completely removed, setting it to zero. 

""Once this is fully live, every single developer will need to manually put in a compute budget instruction to set the specific compute unit usage within their transaction,"" Nick clarified.

This change is expected to lead to more densely packed blocks, which has several positive implications:

* Improved network efficiency
* Better utilization of Solana's computational resources
* Increased revenue for validator operators

Mike praised the approach: ""They've done it in a really responsible way as well. I think reducing it from an insanely high number to a reasonable number that handles most simple transactions. And then if you want something, if you want a little bit more complex transaction, you need to set a compute unit budget now. That's a very nice way of rolling in a significant change like this.""

The gradual implementation of this change allows developers time to adjust their code and ensures that simpler transactions will still function without modification during the transition period.

## Impact on the Validator Community

The compute unit optimization proposal has particularly positive implications for the Solana validator community. By enabling more densely packed blocks, validators stand to benefit from increased revenue.

""If you think of the latter as a main net and dev net and test net as big global computers, every byte counts. It's a resource constrained system. And the result of more densely packed blocks is that people running validators get more revenue, which is great,"" Mike explained.

This change aligns with Solana's ongoing efforts to create a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for all participants, including the crucial validator operators who maintain the network's integrity and performance.

## Community Engagement in Solana Improvement Proposals

The Solana team encourages active participation from the community in discussing and refining improvement proposals. Developers and stakeholders can access these proposals at solana.com/simd, which redirects to the appropriate GitHub repository.

""If you have any thoughts on this particular SIMD or any SIMD, feel free to jump on the GitHub,"" Nick urged. ""And have the conversation. We've already got Caveman Loveboy out here posting some sort of points that he would like to bring up.""

This open approach to development ensures that the Solana ecosystem evolves in a way that best serves its community and maintains its position as a leading blockchain platform.

## Conclusion: Solana's Continuing Evolution

The latest Solana Changelog highlights the platform's commitment to education, efficiency, and community engagement. From the comprehensive professional education resources to the significant updates in RPC methods and compute unit optimization, Solana is taking substantial steps to enhance its ecosystem.

These developments underscore Solana's dedication to maintaining its position as a high-performance blockchain platform while also fostering a knowledgeable and engaged developer community. As the platform continues to evolve, it's clear that Solana is not just focusing on technical improvements but also on empowering its users and developers with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed.

The upcoming Breakpoint conference is expected to bring even more exciting announcements and developments for the Solana ecosystem. As Nick and Mike concluded, ""That's going to wrap it up for this episode of the Change Log. And we'll catch you at breakpoint. See you there.""

For developers, validators, and Solana enthusiasts, these changes signal an exciting time of growth and optimization. By staying informed and engaged with these developments, the Solana community can continue to drive innovation and adoption in the blockchain space.

Reddit,solana,How to protect your Solana crypto from bankrupt exchanges,2024-09-17 01:10:28,"To keep your crypto safe from exchange failures, here are some ideas to protect yourself.

An exchange can fail on a few fronts, such as bankruptcy, an internal hack and third party loan defaulting.

* **Withdraw after trading:** Once you complete a trade, transfer your crypto to a wallet outside of the exchange, this way you’re protected from most of the exchange's potential failures. Avoid leaving an important amount on exchanges, so if anything happens, the impact is minimal. Do not prioritize the convenience of leaving assets on exchange over security. Bonus tip: store into cold wallets / hardware wallets what you do not need to trade immediately. If you can afford the 5 minutes it takes to move assets from a cold wallet to a hot wallet, do it, it’s worth it to be safe.
* **Use insured exchanges:** Opt for exchanges that offer insurance for customer funds in case of theft or failure. They are rare, make sure to read all of the fine prints.
* **Diversify exchanges:** Spread your assets across multiple exchanges, with insurances, if you absolutely have to leave assets on the exchanges to reduce risk.

Remember to enable 2FA, this is the minimum you should do to avoid an external threat to drain your funds. If an internal employee targets you, it probably won’t help, but it’s a good measure anyway. Does not protect against bankruptcy or lack of liquidity.

These measures can significantly reduce the risk of losing your assets. ",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,solana,Spotting and avoiding crypto Solana scams 101,2024-09-16 15:44:14,"Crypto scams are increasingly common and can deceive even expert investors. Here are some tips on how to avoid them:

# Common Scams:

* **Token pre-sale / Investment schemes:** Scammers promise high ROI and request upfront fees, or upfront investment in a token with a promise of being “high-potential”.
* **Rug pulls and slow rugs:** Fraudulent projects that disappear after taking investors' money, some happen a few minutes after the launch, while slow rugs happen over a longer period of time (undefined).
* **Phishing scams:** Fake websites and emails designed to steal your login credentials.
* **Fake trading platforms:** Scam sites posing as legitimate exchanges to steal your deposit funds.

# How to avoid scams:

* Avoid projects with guaranteed profits.
* Investigate any project extensively before trading.
* Never share your private keys or seed phrases.
* If an opportunity seems too good to be true, it likely is.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,solana,Looking for Pilot Study Participants in a Novel Information Platform,2024-09-16 10:44:56,"Hi everyone,

I’m a solo founder trying to tackle a tough problem: disinformation and bias. I don’t know about you, but I’ve often felt like the news isn’t always objective (to put it mildly). Journalists, scientists, and bloggers are often caught in a tough spot—they need to follow the money, which leads to clickbait, infotainment, and political propaganda. But what if there was a way to encourage people to be as accurate as possible instead?

That’s where **Belief Markets** comes in. It’s a platform where you can bet on answers to questions like ""Is there life on Mars?"" or ""Is politician X an honest person?"". The cool part is, there’s no need for a definite outcome like in prediction markets. It works more like a stock market—if you think an answer is undervalued, you buy shares, post evidence, and if others find your info convincing, the price will go up, and you can sell at a profit. The idea is that competition in the market will punish bias and reward accuracy. I believe this could really help solve a big problem: making news and information more objective.

I’ve spent months working on this, and after many late nights and challenges, the platform is finally live on the Solana Devnet. Now I need people like you to help test it out. Honestly, I’m nervous but also excited to see if others find this idea as compelling as I do.

I’d love your participation, and I’m grateful for any feedback—good or bad. I don’t know if I can offer big monetary rewards, but I’ll do my best to give something. Mostly, I’m just hoping to get people involved who are curious and want to help make this better.

If you're interested, send me a message since I can't post links here. No pressure on how much time you spend—any input is appreciated!

Thanks so much for your time!

Obviously there is still a lot of interest in memecoins, and I believe there is always an opportunity to find a gem, and make some insane gains.

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-15 23:36:34,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,solana,Is cryptocurrency based company ownership tracking a idea worth pursuing?,2024-09-15 15:04:31,"Hi,

I want to hear your feedback on the feasibility of this idea and if you believe it's worth anything. It's nothing set in stone, no coin i'm advertising, I'm trying to see if you believe this would work with crypto nowadays and if you believe it's worth looking into further:

I come from a lawtech background (Company in tech automating tasks that would oftentimes be reserved to legal profesions, usually on the border of what is considered to be a task for a lawyer vs a task that anybody can do given enough knowledge).

We started as a business registration company and one of the threads of ideas we've had internally is in regards to using tokens for governance and share representation in companies.

I know that there was quite a serious discussion regarding using crypto to tie to actual stocks on exchanges worldwide (NYSE, NASDAQ, Euronext, XSHG, etc), however it was faced with a lot of regulatory problems which ended up in making the projects often fail. Plus, most people weren't as interested as expected in using crypto to pretty much own the right to a security that you'd be able to own directly and be safer.

This applies to stocks or other securities that are listed on stock exchanges and are both regulated as well as easier to access somehwere else.

One of the foundational benefits of Cryptocurrency is that it's quite affordable now with the last couple of projects doing proof of timestamp and proof of stake, and they're safer (from a technical perspective) than many off-chain solutions, plus they have redundancy built in.

What we were discussing (as we don't see regulatory being an issue for us as we already have a background in that area, even if it takes time) was developing a Crowdfunding based system using cryptocurrency.

Number one, I personally see a huge potential in the small business investment space. There's currently almost no offering outside institutions (VC Funds, Crowdfunders that oftentimes have very complex processes and require vetting, etc) which makes it hard to access funds, and if you are a reasonably competent business owner that can generate a ROI of 3-4x in the next 3 years (which is reasonable for smaller businesses and more niche models), there's nobody to invest into you.

Now yes, the growdth potential of many of these businesses is smaller, but they're millions, unlike startups that inherently are limited only to verticals with a lot of request (Uber for example replaced the gigantic taxi market, Airbnb gave an alternative to the institutional hotels market, etc). So as a person that has invested in the past I am sometimes pissed I can't invest into smaller projects and try to differentiate over tens or hundreds of them to get over market average.

It's less hands off than with traditional stock exchanges but it can also bring larger ROI and if you temper in the risk, I believe the models are even less risky than many startups that got listed on stock exchanges. If you know a chef is popular in his community and you see proof of that, along with great history, you can be quite sure that if he opens a local restaurant he can have quite a good chance of being popular and attracting clients. It's a very simple business model that is also more stable in general. Plus the sums needed for success are smaller.

Now the concern with this is that many talented people lack money, and going back to point one, they don't have any low-risk costs that can cover them. If I have a family with children, I'm not going to risk going in debt to a bank, but I would love getting invested in, but maybe I lack the capital to do it. So I'm going to give up a great business model, when a great alternative would've been finding a way to crowdfund it. And crypto is a good way to do it.

Number two, you can always remove the intermediary without major downsides (meaning that in the worst case scenario the crowdfunding site goes into bankruptcy, you won't get to a situation where you don't know who funded you or it's hard for funders to get their money back), since the on-chain ledger can be respected by anybody, even outside the founding entity or the project developers.

So in short because I wrote a lot, what I propose is a form of stock management through crypto for small companies (valuation under 1M eur), targeted at small businesses. I'm going to need to write a few emails to national regulatory bodies but reading the law and previous court cases, there's almost no regulation in Romania.

Ofc some things will require KYC/KYB, but this is already something people got used with when dealing with CEX, so I personally believe people wouldn't mind if they would have to do KYC/KYB if they for example want to vote in the meeting of shareholders for various decisions. And they'd do it one time.

I know in the US, the SEC regulates the matter so I'm unable to opine there. What is certain is that a EU business can own a US one so that's one way to make it work, plus regulations oftentimes fit on solutions, so if you have a good one regulators will adapt.

I see crypto as able to cut the costs veeery much, I won't name coins but some have very little gas fees. The cost of dealing with this traditionally is larger than using a coin on the chain. Plus (depending on the chain) there is some great evidentiary data to help with both regulatory purposes and track changes in share owning.

Crypto is perfect for this in my opinion. What do you think though, do you believe this is something worth putting 100 hours into and \~1000 EUR researching?

Edit: To clarify, 1000 EUR + 100 hours is how much it'd take for me to pilot and test this, not to create a solution.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,solana,advice on managing risks,2024-09-14 14:28:14,"
i’ve started trading meme coins around 8 months ago. back then i was building my altcoin bag and decided to diversify it with some blue chip memes.
with time i started spending way more time in meme space and i enjoyed it. trading memes is probably the funniest and the most exciting thing i ever did. 
it somehow has all of the components i’m passionate about - memes, marketing, cultural events, politics etc. 
long story short - i’ve been trading memes for six months now (started with 1k meme bag) and my bag is at ath (~50k). i never cashed out any funds - i am comfortable with my irl job income so i always treated meme trading as a chance of either slowly building a significant amount of money or ride it to zero (which i would be ok with worst case scenario)
at the same time i heard to many stories of people round tripping in the previous bull run so i decided to set up an ambitious cash out target - 100k.

now the question- as i am halfway to my goal i wanna revisit the plan and here are two scenarios that i see 

1) sol is at 137 rn and i’m sitting in a good coins that would probably do 3-4x+ if sol goes back to ath.

2) market will find a way to fuck me so do i just cash out now?

so you see - i’m both greedy of missing out on a real life changing money (way higher then my goal)
but at the same time i’m starting to realize i got to the point where it would be mentally hard to round trip.

what would you do? and thanks x

Reddit,solana,📉 Traders to Avoid When Copy Trading on Solana:,2024-09-14 21:46:00,"1. Scalper Traders: Their trades typically last less than a minute, making it unprofitable to copy them with free copy trading bots due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)

2. Traders with Numerous Buys: If a trader makes more than 4-5 buys, it becomes challenging to manage money effectively. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your deposit per trade and the trader makes 7-9 buys of a scam token, you could lose 70-90% of your assets.

3. Mixed Token Traders: These traders receive tokens from other wallets and also purchase tokens themselves. Their profit and loss (PnL) on trades may be higher than yours due to tokens received from external sources.

4. Token snipers: These traders buy tokens at the start of their market appearance (first candle). Using free copy trading bots with them can lead to losses due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,solana,Multi-signature Solana wallets for safer funds,2024-09-14 16:56:27,"Multi-signature wallets provide additional security of your crypto holdings by requiring more than one private key to authorize transactions. This added layer of security makes it much more difficult for hackers to steal your funds, particularly useful for companies and groups of traders sharing the same funds. It only applies to funds kept outside of exchanges, as they don’t support multi-sig wallets.

# Benefits:

* **Stronger security:** Your funds remain safe even if one key is compromised.
* **Shared access:** Ideal for groups like families or businesses where multiple people need access.
* **Reduced theft risk:** A single stolen key is insufficient to access your funds.

However, managing multiple keys can be challenging, and losing a key might complicate fund recovery. When used correctly, multisig wallets provide excellent protection for your crypto assets. Along with 2FA / MFA, it’s extra layers of security!",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,ethereum,Account Abstraction: Crypto Beyond Private Keys,2024-09-18 14:46:04,"Chances are, you have come across the term “account abstraction,” but you don’t know what it means. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

Let’s dive into this fascinating topic and see how it can transform your understanding of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cryhfe1bxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c156583b63dfe1fa0fbb46ca88fe2e33573ec4

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Reddit,ethereum,Can KYC Add Security Without Compromising Decentralization? 🤔 ,2024-09-16 19:18:52,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

I've been doing some research and learning the basics, though there is a lot of info to take in here and trying to figure out what's best, and how to not accidentally screw myself and lose any coin in the process.



Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?



Sorry if these sound like dumb questions, but any help is appreciated!

I'm curious about why there seem to be so few opportunities for junior smart contract developers.

I understand that smart contract development requires a solid understanding of blockchain and security pitfalls, but if companies aren't offering junior roles, how are developers supposed to gain that experience?

I've been searching for opportunities for the last 2 months, but there are literally zero openings for entry-level positions. 

Most of the companies are asking for 5 years of experience in blockchain and 5 years in front-end development.

3. Any internal (Call) transactions.
4. Gives status of the transaction (Weather it was successfull or not)

1. Moralis: They have the perfect endpoint that i was looking for (Moralis.EvmApi.wallets.getWalletHistory) but they are not providing correct information or even missing information in the transactions.

2. Etherscan: Although i can't get all the above information in the same api call, i can if i combine multiple endpoints, but they are limited to 10000 records which makes them unusable.
3. Tatum: They dont provide information regarding Internal transaction
4. Alchemy: They have this endpoint ""alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers"" which was kinda perfect but they dont give information regarding transaction status.

Also when I up grade my hardware I will start running my own Ethereum node.

Does this affect price drastically over time? For example, I have a spreadsheet that calculates the amount at different market caps. Is this amount still accurate at a higher market cap? Or does this mean the value of the amount at different market caps will change over time because of token burning?

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 13:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Earning bitcoin

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoin by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

The Late Majority phase ( 50% to 84% of Bitcoin adoption ) may occur from 2030 to 2040, with the price range around $500,000 to $5,000,000.

The Laggards phase ( 84% to 100% of Bitcoin adoption ) is expected from 2040 to 2050, with the price range possibly around $5,000,000 to $50,000,000.

Bitcoin adoption is about around 3% to 4% global adoption now ( 2024 ) and there will be another 10% of Bitcoin adoption just in the next 6 years. If you think you're late to Bitcoin, there's still time to get involved before widespread adoption drives the price to very new heights.

I hate the idea of plugging in the device, moving it to Coinbase, selling it, and then moving the funds to my personal bank account. It's too much work and there are too many steps so therefore, I have held it, and not touched it.

I am the guy who jumps in and out of stocks, buys low sells high, buys high sells low, buys the right stuff, sells it and buys the bad stuff. If my bitcoin was easy to get to and easy to sell, I would've sold it long ago.

Reddit,bitcoin,QUESTION ABOUT QUANTUM COMPUTING AND LOST WALLETS,2024-09-19 00:03:04,"I remembet watching a video of Andreas Antonopoulos about quantum computing and BTC. He was saying that precautions can be taken for active wallets only. In fact, he was saying that the first sign of a quantum computer strong enough to break the current protocols of the BTC network would be to see the BTC in the wallet of Satoshi being moved because (assuming Satoshi is dead so nobody has its private key) nobody can “protect” those BTC with eventual quantum resistant countermeasures.
If that is the case, it would be like a sudden flood of “new” coins in the market that would cause a dramatic crash in value.
At that point it would be bad for everybody else. 
Is this unavoidable?

Please do not respond that we would have “bigger problems”. The problem here is that, in contrst to everything else (banks, military codes, etc…) that can take countermeasures before powerful enough quantum computers appear, it woild seem that the wallet of Satoshi CANNOT be protected. 
Like if tomorrow an enormous source of gold was in control of a major nation entity. I hear the wallet of Satoshi is about 1M BTC.

Reddit,bitcoin,What Will Happen When the Number of Leading Zeros in Block Hashes Continues to Increase?,2024-09-18 23:49:07,"I was comparing the genesis block to the current blocks and noticed that the number of leading zeros in the block hashes is increasing over time. This increase is due to the rising difficulty of mining as more computational power joins the network.

I am aware that eventually, miners will no longer receive new bitcoins as a block reward because the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins will have been reached. At that point, miners will only earn transaction fees. I am concerned that these fees may not be sufficient to incentivize miners to continue spending significant resources on mining Bitcoin, as the profitability will decrease. My theory is that this could lead to the Bitcoin network and blockchain becoming less secure, potentially allowing someone to compromise it, which would cause Bitcoin to lose its value.

[Bitnodes.io](http://Bitnodes.io) says that it is not accassible (it has run for several hours), so I went through all the instructions on [bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org), setting up my router.



I found the right machine in my routers admin page by MAC address and added the (local) IP under ""**Add DHCP Reservation**""



Under port forwarding I added a rule with the local IP and 8333 as both inbound and outbound. And both tcp and udp. And ""allow all"" as filter.



But still its not reachable



[Bitnodes.io](http://Bitnodes.io) uses my public IP which is also the ip of my other laptop. Makes sense.



I tried to use my work laptop and VPN to my work and then ping the local IP of the laptop that runs the node. It pings fine



As far as I know there is no firewall running on the node machine.



How will the router know that a machine from outside would like to use the local IP of the node machine and not any oft the other devices connected? By looking at the port it wants to use? I think I am missing something



I looked under Routing settings that has:



**Add Static Route**

Destination IP Address;

Destination IP Netmask;

Gateway;

Metric;

Interface;



Should I use these? I dont know what a gateway is

Now A launch a majority attack, and he can cancel the previous transaction to B (which was confirmed). But A and B don't have any UTXO in their pocket 

So what will happen, will C be involved and loose money ?
I mean A can only change transactions with his/her signature so can't do anything with the transaction between B and C, right ?

So if a merchant have 2 accounts, when he receive payment from buyer, he can next transfer it to his second account to avoid attack, right ?

My question is, if I send my whole stack to a new wallet, will the new wallet basically just have one UTXO?

Given enough bitcoiners moved there we could rebuild the city and control local legislation to be pro bitcoin. Bring in massive bitcoin mining operations to give jobs to the locals and harness the power of the great falls. (Also plenty of empty old factory buildings)

Reddit,bitcoin,Lets imagine a future world where bitcoin has replaced fiat money.,2024-09-18 11:03:17,"Lets imagine a future world where bitcoin has replaced fiat money. Lets ignore a myriad of issues like a fixed monetary supply representing wealth in a growing economy, deflation etc.

People and companies and governments will still need credit. You may want to buy a house, start a business, companies will want to invest in factories, airliners need aiplanes,  governments will want to build bridges etc. So they will issue bitcoin denominated IOUs. Rather than always having to pay upfront for goods or services, or airplanes or factories or bridges, they will write credit notes. ""good for 1M satoshi"". Simple, effective, but that only works if the creditor trusts the debtor. Which is a problem. Your grocery manager may trust you will make good on your IOU next month, but only if he personally knows you.  And even if that trust is there, then the creditor, the grocery store manager who gave you your food, or the contractor who built the factory will discover he is stuck with the IOU until its repaid, he cant use it to pay his own bills. And he is not rich and  doesnt want to be a bank.

So instead of the debtor issuing his own IOU, the creditor will demand an IOU from a mutually trusted third party. Like a wealthy common acquaintance. That third party will take on the credit risk of the borrower, and underwrite the IOU, making it trustworthy to the creditor even if he doesnt know the debtor. That IOU will be trustworty to anyone else trusting that third party. So now bitcoin denominated credit can circulate: the contractor can use the borrowers debt to pay his own employees and machines as long as everyone trusts the wealthy acquaintance.   And the risk of the debtor becoming insolvent is no longer the contractor's risk. Genius!

But then other problems will pop up. People will want to redeem their credit notes for bitcoin from the wealthy acquaintance.  As wealthy as he may be, he can never instantly recoup all outstanding debts, many of which will be long term, so even if he is solvent and financially healthy, he can fall victim to bank runs.

To reduce this risk and fear of it, big creditors pool their resources together and create a central bitcoin bank to loan solvent, but illiquid credit issuers with bitcoin if they need them. Brilliant.

Some wont be solvent though, some will fail and go bankrupt because they issued too many bad loans they cant recoup. Anyone who was paid with credit notes from that issuer will see their money go up in smoke. Bitcoin credit money therefore isnt fungible, as some issuers will be trusted more than others. People will also revolt when their credit notes suddenly become worthless for no fault of their own. So a sort of insurance scheme is cooked up, that backs credit notes from participating credit issuers, with the system as a whole assuming the credit risk.  Now bitcoin based credit is fungible, and people who dont want to be banks dont have to assume credit risks or personally audit credit issuers. Awesome.

Then one day, someone realizes that everyone is using bitcoin denominated credit notes, and hardly anyone ever redeems them for bitcoin. And its even pointless to maintain this link, since the real thing backing up the totality of credit notes is not some magic numbers in a blockchain, but the cumulative obligation and liability of all debtors. So the link is cut.

So instead of having fiat money that used to, but no longer is backed by gold, we will end up with fiat money that used to, but no longer is backed by bitcoin. Revolutionary!

TL;DR Bitcoin is digital gold. It has its uses, but anyone who thinks gold coins or bitcoin can possibly replace fiat money and yield a healthy, growing economy, doesnt understand how money works or the 5000 years worth of lessons we have learned from it.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,AMA - Tokemak Autopilot - The Automated Liquidity Router for LPs,2024-09-19 00:28:41,"This is our first time interacting with the r/cryptocurrency community, so thanks for hosting us and we look forward to everyone’s questions. *We’ll be announcing this from our main X account tomorrow.* 

Our new product Autopilot launched this past Monday, September 16th. Autopilot is the first LP aggregator - it provides users with intelligent and autonomous optimization between a set of assets and destinations, all in a single deposit.

Autopilot monitors the market so you don’t have to - constantly processing an extensive set of data to keep your ETH optimally allocated across a set of pools, auto-compounding and saving on expensive rebalancing transactions. 

**The Tokemak team will be here on September 20th at 7pm UTC to answer any questions you have about Autopilot.**

# What problem is Autopilot trying to solve?

Providing liquidity in DeFi, particularly to correlated trading pairs such as ETH LSTs/LRTs and stablecoins, can be an extremely efficient way to earn additional yield on one's assets onchain. Despite this, it comes with many complexities to achieve that efficiency. 

The problem is that liquidity providers (LPs) face a highly complex decision making process in order to optimize their return. This includes:

* Variance of yields and their composition;
* different fee and reward systems;
* offsetting various costs such as gas, slippage, and trading fees;
* different AMM models.

Even without considering these challenges, the high costs of rebalancing and compounding leads to underperformance for the average user and can prevent many from participating altogether.

Tokemak Autopilot introduces the concept of autoLP’ing to address these challenges and enables access to long term outperformance for all, starting with our ETH focused Autopools.

# What is Autopilot?

Autopilot works by rebalancing deposited liquidity across a set of pools - we call this an Autopool. An Autopool is a vault utilizing the ERC-4626 standard, configured with different pool destinations eligible for liquidity rebalances. 

Upon depositing funds into an Autopool, Autopilot will monitor all included pools and reallocate liquidity into the optimal pool as time passes and APRs change. This entire process is autonomous, provides optimal yields to LPs, and is entirely passive for Autopilot users.

Autopools also provide users with a LATs - Liquidity Auto Tokens - a yield-bearing receipt token that represents your underlying deposit in an Autopool. By tokenizing Autopools, it  offers a brand new composable asset within DeFi.

# What are the available Autopools?

The currently available Autopools are denominated in ETH and provide a passive option for users who want to earn yield while providing liquidity to stable ETH pools. These are the first three Autopools now open for deposits:

* autoETH - Autopool featuring ETH LSTs
* balETH - Autopool featuring ETH LSTs and LRTs deployed on Balancer
* autoLRT - Autopool featuring ETH LRTs

The LP user experience while providing liquidity to an Autopool is extremely simple:

1. Deposit ETH.
2. Receive an Autopool receipt token.
3. Earn LP rewards passively while Autopilot reallocates liquidity across pools.

# Learn More

These are the best resources to get up to speed on Autopilot.

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So what about combining seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**. 

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/n43iw1xr0kpd1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=8056b9e75e0683d43eb55bd4e1a79e60a58d1afd

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/lczzs0mt0kpd1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e9914e10f9520698ca81a54e833ef2e435a265

Since the S&P 500 has returned +75% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,750 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+617%**, worth **$7,172.**

**That’s a difference of $5,422 on a $1k investment.**

But that’s just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a look at the combined seven year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"The Core Principles of Cryptocurrency ""Scalability""",2024-09-18 19:35:45,"https://preview.redd.it/mw9aavsvdmpd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9094c5974029c032b6ed776d946cca2404c46a87

One of the biggest talking points in cryptocurrency is ""scalability."" But what does this really mean?

Many cryptocurrency advocates boast about the scalability of their favorite coin without having much real understanding of the meaning. In most cases, the numbers being touted as the maximum transactions per second (TPS) of a network are nothing more than an artificial constraint due to protocol limitations. In reality, these ""maximum TPS"" numbers don't describe a network's scaling capabilities, but rather its scaling limitations.

If our goal is really to create a monetary foundation for a new global economy, it's critical that we establish a clear understanding of the meaning of scalability, and what is required to achieve scalability capable of serving the demand of a global monetary system.

Scalability isn't just about ""max TPS"" and protocol thresholds. It's a multifaceted challenge involving network design, resource management, and real-world performance considerations.

Let's take a look at some of the core principles of scalability for distributed ledger networks.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Purpose-Driven Architecture

Perhaps the most fundamental principle of scalability is purpose-driven architecture. In the same philosophy as phrases such as ""keep it simple, stupid!"" (KISS) popularized by Lockheed engineer Kelly Johnson, and ""do one thing, and do it well"" (DOTADIW) popularized by Unix developer Doug McIlroy, purpose-driven architecture emphasizes focus on optimization of a system for its primary function. For the sake of this discussion, that primary function is monetary payments.

Imagine using a Swiss Army knife as your sole tool for driving screws, cutting, etc. While versatile, it's not the most efficient tool for any specific job. Similarly, many distributed ledger networks aim to be all-encompassing, offering functionalities such as smart contracts and decentralized applications. While this versatility can be attractive and induce demand and investment, it often comes at the expense of efficiency, having a detrimental effect on the processing of monetary payments.

By concentrating solely on payments, a network can allocate resources more effectively, reduce operational costs, and handle a higher volume of transactions without incurring prohibitive expenses.

When a network supports non-monetary use cases, monetary transactions must compete for network resources and priority. Unfortunately, monetary payments are often less profitable compared to just about every alternative use case. This competition results in monetary transactions being deprioritized, leading to higher fees, slower processing times, and an overall degraded user experience.

Support for non-monetary use cases can even be unintentional. Networks that allow storage of arbitrary data can be exploited for non-monetary purposes. This misuse increases resource consumption (computation and storage) and operational costs, which are ultimately passed on to users through increased fees, inflation, or degraded network performance. This has been observable even in Bitcoin, with ""NFT"" exploits for storing arbitrary data such as Ordinal Inscriptions, Bitcoin Stamps, and BRC-20 tokens causing exponential surges in fees and confirmation times.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Asynchronous Data Structures and Consensus Protocols

Traditional blockchains process transactions sequentially, creating a linear chain of blocks. This sequence means that unrelated transactions can bottleneck the network because their processing is blocked by the processing of preceding transactions. This design inherently limits scalability, as all transactions are processed one after another.

Asynchronous data structures, like Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), allow for parallel processing of transactions that aren't dependent on each other. Multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously, significantly increasing throughput and reducing confirmation times. By enabling asynchronous processing, networks can better handle the high transaction volumes required in a global economy.

The type of consensus protocol also plays a crucial role in scalability. Leader-based consensus protocols, such as Bitcoin's Nakamoto Consensus, rely on a single node (the ""leader"") to propose the next block of transactions. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle, and the first to solve it adds the next block to the chain. This is a synchronous process that forms bottlenecks in the system's overall performance.

In contrast, leaderless consensus protocols, especially those utilizing vote propagation in Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems, distribute the consensus process across multiple nodes without a central authority. Nodes collaborate to reach agreement on the order and validity of transactions through weighted voting mechanisms. This can be done asynchronously, ensuring that no transaction processing is blocked by the processing of other unrelated transactions.

This leaderless approach reduces single points of failure and allows for more efficient processing of transactions. By not relying on a single leader, the network can achieve lower latency and higher throughput, as multiple nodes contribute to consensus simultaneously. This method is particularly effective when combined with asynchronous data structures, further enhancing the network's ability to scale and handle global transaction volumes.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling and Decentralization

In traditional computing, scaling is often achieved by adding more servers (horizontal scaling) or enhancing existing ones (vertical scaling). However, in distributed ledger networks requiring consensus among nodes, these concepts don't apply in quite the same way.

Adding more nodes to a distributed ledger network doesn't necessarily improve throughput. In fact, it can introduce additional latency because more nodes need to communicate and agree on the network's state. For distributed ledger networks, real-world throughput is actually inversely correlated to level of decentralization. As the number of nodes increases, the time required to reach consensus can also increase, slowing down the formation of consensus.

While decentralization is foundational to blockchain technology, it presents a scalability challenge. The more decentralized a network is, the more complex and time-consuming the consensus process becomes. This complexity can hinder the network's ability to process transactions quickly and efficiently, which is crucial for a global-scale monetary system.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Optimized Data Dissemination

Even if a network can theoretically process thousands of transactions per second, real-world throughput depends on how quickly data can be propagated and disseminated across the network. The latency for data dissemination - the time it takes for transaction data to reach all nodes - is a critical factor in network performance.

Efficient data propagation ensures that all nodes receive transaction data promptly, facilitating quicker consensus and higher throughput. Implementing optimized communication protocols, such as modern gossip protocols, can help minimize latency and improve the network's ability to handle a large volume of transactions.

Unfortunately, the majority of distributed ledger networks use relatively naive mechanisms for data dissemination, such as traditional gossip protocols, causing network latency to be orders of magnitude greater than necessary.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Node Synchronization and Quality of Service (QoS)

As networks scale up to handle more transactions, node synchronization becomes crucial for maintaining efficiency. This means ensuring that all network nodes agree on the order in which they process incoming transactions. This is commonly referred to as the determination of prioritization for quality of service (QoS).

Under normal conditions, nodes can easily stay synchronized because they have enough time to communicate and align on transaction ordering. However, when the network reaches maximum capacity (i.e. ""saturation"") keeping nodes in sync becomes much more challenging. If nodes start processing transactions in different orders due to timing differences or delays, it can create compounding backlogs and increases in latency. This misalignment results in severely degraded network performance.

To prevent this, it's essential for networks to establish a common protocol for transaction ordering, especially under heavy load. By following standardized rules, nodes can maintain synchronization and process transactions efficiently, ensuring smooth network performance even when demand is high.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Minimal Protocol-Level Constraints

Most cryptocurrencies have protocol-level constraints - such as block size and block time - that effectively create a maximum theoretical throughput. While these limitations are often in place for security and stability, they can become bottlenecks as network demand grows.

To achieve true scalability, as many throughput constraints as possible should be removed from the protocol. This approach allows scalability to be limited only by node hardware, networking, and synchronization, rather than arbitrary protocol parameters. By minimizing built-in constraints, networks can better adapt to increasing demand without sacrificing performance, and scale in correlation to Moore's Law.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Seeing [failure] is believing

Understanding the impact of scalability constraints often requires witnessing first-hand a system under real-world stress. Bitcoin has provided clear examples of this challenge. During periods of high demand, the Bitcoin network has experienced exponential surges in transaction fees and confirmation times. These spikes make the limitations of its scalability tangible, affecting user experience and trust in the network's efficiency.

Despite Bitcoin's prominence, no cryptocurrency - Bitcoin included - has sustained a level of stress of any significance relative to what will be expected of a global monetary system. This means we haven't fully observed how scalability constraints affect most networks when pushed to their limits. Bitcoin's visible struggles under relatively insignificant usage highlight the importance of addressing scalability head-on. Without firsthand experience of such stress, it's easy to underestimate the critical nature of scalability constraints in distributed ledger networks.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Nano's Approach: A Case Study in Effective Scaling

Nano exemplifies effective scaling in the cryptocurrency realm by aligning its design with the core principles of scalability. By focusing exclusively on being a digital currency optimized for payments, Nano has been architected to handle high transaction volumes with minimal latency and zero fees, making it a strong candidate for a global monetary system.

# Purely Monetary Purpose

Nano adheres to the philosophy of ""do one thing, and do it well."" It is designed solely for monetary transactions, avoiding the complexities and inefficiencies that come with supporting non-monetary use cases like smart contracts or decentralized applications. This singular focus ensures that all network resources are dedicated to processing payments efficiently, without competition from other types of use cases that could congest the network or inflate fees. By eliminating support for arbitrary data storage and non-monetary use cases, Nano prevents misuse of the network that would otherwise degrade performance and increase operational costs.

# Asynchronous ""Block Lattice"" Data Structure

At the core of Nano's scalability is its innovative Block Lattice architecture. Unlike traditional blockchains that process transactions sequentially in a linear chain, Nano's Block Lattice is a type of DAG in which each account consists of its own blockchain (account chain). This means transactions are asynchronous and can be processed in parallel, as they are independent of unrelated transactions. This design significantly increases throughput and reduces confirmation times, as there's no need to wait for global consensus on a single chain of blocks.

# Asynchronous ""ORV"" Leaderless BFT Consensus Protocol

Nano employs an asynchronous and leaderless ""Open Representative Voting"" (ORV) consensus protocol. In ORV, account holders delegate their voting weight to representatives based on their account balance. These representatives participate in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus by propagating votes for transactions. Since consensus is achieved through a weighted voting system without a central leader, the network avoids bottlenecks associated with leader selection, and can process transactions more efficiently.

# Principal Representative Mechanism

Nano introduces the concept of principal representatives to balance decentralization with data dissemination latency. Principal representatives are nodes that have accumulated a significant amount of delegated voting weight. While the network remains decentralized by allowing any account to choose its representative, concentrating votes among principal representatives streamlines the consensus process. This reduces communication overhead and latency, as fewer nodes need to be consulted to achieve consensus, without compromising the overall decentralization of the network.

# Hierarchical Gossip about Gossip Protocol

To enhance data dissemination efficiency, Nano utilizes a hierarchical Gossip about Gossip protocol, made possible by its principal representative system. This protocol allows for faster propagation of transaction data and consensus votes across the network compared to traditional gossip protocols. By organizing nodes hierarchically, with principal representatives at higher tiers, information spreads more rapidly and efficiently. This results in orders of magnitude faster data dissemination, which is critical for maintaining low latency and high throughput in a global payment network.

# Opportunity Cost for Quality of Service and Spam Mitigation

Nano addresses node synchronization and Quality of Service (QoS) by implementing an ""opportunity cost"" QoS model for all node operations that factors in both the account balance and the time since the last transaction. Transactions are prioritized based on this model, which segments node operations like transaction validation into round-robin queues categorized by account balance and prioritized by least recently used. This ensures fair access to network resources and mitigates the impact of spam by making it extremely difficult for malicious actors to monopolize network capacity. By disincentivizing abuse and ensuring synchronized transaction ordering across nodes, Nano maintains network efficiency even under extreme load.

# Removal of Protocol-Level Constraints

Nano has eliminated nearly all protocol-level constraints that could limit throughput, such as fixed block sizes or block times. This design choice allows Nano to scale in accordance with Moore's Law, with scalability constrained only by node hardware, networking, and synchronization. By removing arbitrary limits, Nano ensures that its network can adapt to increasing demand and technological advancements without requiring additional complexity or protocol changes.

# A Compelling Demonstration of Effective Cryptocurrency Scaling

Nano's approach to scalability embodies the core principles necessary for a cryptocurrency to function effectively as a global monetary system. By maintaining a purely monetary purpose, leveraging asynchronous data structures and a leaderless consensus protocol, optimizing data dissemination, implementing innovative QoS measures, and removing protocol-level constraints, Nano demonstrates that it is possible to achieve high throughput and low latency without compromising decentralization or security. This makes Nano a compelling case study in effective scaling, showcasing how thoughtful design choices can overcome the inherent challenges of distributed ledger networks.

⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

# Conclusion

Scaling a distributed ledger network to meet global demands is a complex challenge requiring careful consideration of network design, resource allocation, and real-world performance. A purpose-driven architecture focused on monetary transactions, as exemplified by Nano, can address many scalability challenges by optimizing efficiency and minimizing unnecessary constraints.

Other networks, while innovative, often face trade-offs impacting scalability. High hardware requirements, centralization risks, resource competition from non-monetary use cases, and protocol limitations can hinder a network's ability to process transactions efficiently on a global scale.

As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, networks prioritizing efficiency, fairness, and practical scalability are likely to lead in global adoption. It's an exciting journey ahead, and only the test of time (and demand) will tell which solutions will meet the challenges of serving a global economy.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Possibly dumb question, could the ""difficulty"" problem used in POW mining be modified to serve a dual purpose? ",2024-09-18 15:32:13,I was just watching Bloomberg and they were talking about how massive the demand for energy will be for the future of AI. At first I found it funny how much different energy usage for AI is viewed compared to the way crypto mining was viewed just a few years ago. Then I started thinking about how they will compete with each other for energy demands but then I wondered if they could somehow be combined. I know it's more complicated than that but basically POW is now solving a useless problem and at the same time AI has a very useful problem it needs to solve but no real demand to solve it independently ,2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Kucoin's kucard is just a rip off.,2024-09-17 16:19:15,"Hi, been using their kucard which brings 1% casback on every transaction since months.
Balance in USDT withdrawn in EUR by the kucard. I was pretty happy getting those cashbacks...
Until I realize yesterday that they charge you more USDT than than the real USDT/EUR value.. so they make money on your back.
I asked in the sub to see if somebody had figured it out, and somebody suggested me to change my USDT into EUR and use my EUR balance every time I pay with my kucard. I did, I did... then I realize there's no cashback if you use the EUR balance. What a rip off !
This really leaves me wanting to leave kucoin!
Has anybody figured it out also ?
I guess that if I'd use USDC balance or whatever they'd be still taking money on our back due to their fraudulent currency change.
Would somebody suggest me an interesting app instead of kucoin with a card, a cashback program where they are not actually stealing from you ? All the best. (Ps: cannot use binance).",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Polkadot Marketing Bounty 2.0,2024-09-18 12:36:12,"[Full proposal](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1166)

Ah, the ""Marketing Bounty 2.0"" proposal—it's essentially a proposal dressed up in buzzwords, hefty promises, and an astronomical budget of 200,000 DOT per month for six months. They claim to be “revolutionizing” marketing with a reformed structure and oversight, yet the proposal sounds like a corporate daydream fueled by vague “community engagement” promises and overpaid curators charging €100 per hour. Where’s the focus on actual deliverables? Sounds like a black hole of funds, where the only clear growth will be in those ""curator"" bank accounts.

And let's not overlook the padding here: multiple curators, advisors, specialists, and ""watchdogs""—it's almost as if they’re trying to create a miniature bureaucracy within Polkadot just to manage marketing. Throwing titles around doesn’t magically equal results. Their so-called transparency and ethics might as well be marketing fluff themselves.

You know something's fishy when the ""success metrics"" section boils down to vague promises of ""flexibility in metrics"" and ""evolution over time."" Translation: we'll figure it out later, and hopefully no one will notice the DOT disappearing into thin air.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

I truly have no idea why this has exploded/is exploding up, am I missing something and uninformed what it is about just out of the loop?

I get why for example babydoge that got listed via futures on the exchange I use has gone/will go up because of the speculative nature of it and being a meme coin essentially, so it’s ‘value’ is validated by its just being meme gambling/relates to doge etc etc

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Where will the liquidity come from that will spark the bull run this cycle?,2024-09-16 16:00:43,"There has been an enormous amount of speculation that the US / world will enter a major recession in 2025. To be fair, I have seen calls for an ""historic recession"" since 2012, so I'm always skeptical when I see these claims by ""experts.""


However, I do think a lot about the economic landscape today as compared to the bull run of 2021. Back then, people were locked down, staying at home, and receiving stimulus checks and unemployment benefits, which they spent on entertainment. At that time, Magic the Gathering / tabletop games / video games and consoles were selling at record numbers, and many states enacted temporary rent relief laws that prevented people from being evicted even if they could not pay. Liquidity was high and the markets were awash in excess cash. Gambling sites made record profits. Risk-on assets sold like hot cakes. Bubbles, bubbles everywhere.


Today is a pretty different situation: we've got a housing market squeeze / bubble that might be at the precipice of bursting (but again, remember those 2012 calls for a collapse). The labor markets have cooled significantly, and inflation has driven up COL / housing / groceries enormously. Everyday people - retail fish, as we call them in crypto - do not have the excess disposable cash they did a few years ago. Globally, there is a gigantic Chinese elephant in the room that looks ready to give up the ghost entirely, and more generally a worldwide population that appears reticent to spend money on anything but the essentials.


By now the crypto space has seen the effect of banks and asset management firms jumping into crypto: very little real price movement. It seems that retail, not corporate whales, is the true hope of degens for a massive run up.


What is the argument for a bull run this cycle besides ""it always happens""? Do the bulls expect fed rate cuts to provide the liquidity needed to stimulate risk-on asset buying? 


By the way, I know that a lot of people are hinging their bull run optimism on the irresistibly handsome, super-genius, incredibly emotionally mature, piously truth-telling, and [psychologically VERY stable](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/15/g-s1-23115/trump-taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement) presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the election and creating a federal BTC reserve fund. But I daresay, there's about a zero-percent chance he actually does that. So imagine a situation in which he loses or wins but doesn't create the fund, at least for a few years.

""Oh, [](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)—the digital Wild West where every new coin is the next big thing until it isn’t.

It's the only place where you'll find people calling a 90% drop ""a healthy correction"" and referring to their overpriced JPEGs as ""art.""

And let's not forget the endless sea of acronyms—FUD, HODL, DYOR—more jargon than an alien language, but somehow everyone pretends they know exactly what’s going on. Meanwhile, every other post screams about the imminent ""mass adoption"" that never quite seems to arrive. It’s as if [](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) exists in a parallel universe where everyone is either a millionaire-in-the-making or a bitter ex-investor who “totally saw it coming.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Who would lead the smart contract industry?,2024-09-17 19:21:05,"There are many projects aiming to deliver a fast and cost-effective smart contract platform. However, security and trust are also crucial factors in blockchain technology. Looking at the top 5 smart contract platforms, all seem to be growing, with a cumulative Total Value Locked (TVL) of $81 billion.

Is diversifying into the top 5 smart contracts a good strategy, or is there a clear winner where you might consider going all in?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Guide for using the Community Currency Bot (Off Chain Moon Distributions on R/cc) ,2024-09-16 15:23:26,"Moons are back and distributions are now handled through an off chain bot u/communitycurrencybot. With users earning off Chain Moons every 28 days based off the karma earned on the sub over that period.

# Balance Check:

Once you've earned Moons you can check your balance by sending a message to the bot using the following link:

[https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=CommunityCurrencyBot&subject=Balance%20Inquiry&message=Please%20show%20my%20Community%20Currency%20balances](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=CommunityCurrencyBot&subject=Balance%20Inquiry&message=Please%20show%20my%20Community%20Currency%20balances)

The balance displayed will be the amount of off chain Moons you have earned and are currently stored on the Community Currency Bot.

Note: Not all earned on-chain Moons are kept on the Bot, as a safeguard only a fraction of user earned Moons are available to withdraw on chain via the bot. The rest are stored in Multisig and the bot will be refilled as needed.

**----------**

# Tipping:

Do you see any content on r/cc that you particularly enjoy? If so leave them a tip by responding to either their post or their comment with the following format:

* !tip x

x = the amount of Moons you want to tip. The bot requires a minimum of 1. **Do not add other text to your comment when leaving a tip.**

**----------**

# Withdrawing off chain Moons from the Bot

Once you've earned Moons you are free to tip those Moons to other users in the off chain ecosystem, but if you want to get those Moons on chain you'll need to withdraw them from the bot.

You can type !withdraw x to withdraw Moons from the Bot and get them on chain in your vault.

https://preview.redd.it/rc1nobi2t6pd1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2e974a3f1706ee05f112e1b023a7b5725c820f

If you get an error that you don't have a withdraw address registered or want to use a different address with the bot you can type:

* **!register** 0xCopy-paste-your-own-wallet address

Then try withdrawing again.

**When you withdraw Moons from the bot they will be sent to Arbitrum One not Arbirum Nova. This is due to the recent launch of Moons on Arbitrum One and the multi-sig being on Arb One.**

**----------**

Did you burn Moons to mint an [rcc special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/)?

Send a message to the bot using [this template](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=CommunityCurrencyBot&subject=Subscription%20Activation&message=Please%20activate%20my%20memberships) to activate your special membership.

**Recently there was a bug that didn't activate the special membership on rcc this should have been fixed. If you are are still impacted by this error please leave a comment so I can forward your case to the bot dev.**",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"There is a total of 920 million USDC wagered on Polymarket on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. The outcome of this bet hinges on the UMA oracle, a token with a total market cap of 179 million USD, less than 20% of the bets at stake.",2024-09-16 07:33:54,"So, the Polymarket betting market on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election has ballooned to almost 1 billion USDC wagered (920,717,846 USDC as of writing)

The outcome in the event of a dispute will be decided by a vote of UMA token holders. The market cap of UMA is currently 179.6 million USD. And with as much money wagered as there is and a topic as contentious as this, it is almost certain that enough people will dispute any proposed outcome to trigger a vote.

Doesn't this represent an enormous security risk, seeing as someone needs only spend 180 million USD to manipulate a betting market worth nearly 1 billion USD?

Of course, I am aware that any attempt to actually acquire this many UMA tokens to gain control of the oracle would likely result in a sharp increase in the price of UMA, but it remains a concern that at least must be theoretically addressed.

UMA's website claims ""over 1.25 billion USD in value secured"". If that claim is true, this single betting market would represent nearly half of the total ""value"" secured by UMA, ever.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,There is no 1.4 trillion dollar stimulus headed to bitcoin from China.,2024-09-15 14:48:25,"So, let's use a bit of common sense as we move into this topic. A speculative Forbes article says, ""Maybe china is going to give its people 1000 USD each to go out and spend to get the economy moving again.""               

Okay. Let's break that down. 1000 USD / Person in China. Do you know how difficult it is to put that money into bitcoin if you live anywhere besides Hong Kong?               

Not to sound like a psy-op or a puppet from a foreign state, but it's necessary to name some reminders about China and digital assets:              
1. Ownership is prohibited.                  
2. Manufacturing of mining devices (ASICs) is prohibited (bitmain makes them in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia).              
3. Mining is illegal.                  
4. Using any payment method (wechat pay, alipay, bank transfer, etc.) to buy crypto is illegal.                   

Now, the above points will not stop everyone from buying crypto in China, but even before ""crypto-prohibition"" in China became a thing in 2021, crypto-ownership in China was lower per capita than America or Europe. A sober perspective is to say that maybe a billion or two USD will enter the crypto markets, largely through OTC trades - which are still very punishable and can get anyone's wechatpay / bank / alipay accounts suspended or restricted.               

So, in other words, at best, a few drops in the bucket will enter the market.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

The speech basically explained how the market is shifting towards the metaverse and decentralized operations, covering NFTs, Web 3, DAOs and other crypto things, comparing the modern crypto guy to Buffett, saying that this is a new market that not many are familiar with, telling us not to worry about it and that no one knew Facebook back then either.

Then towards the end they explained how their DAO community worked. They never really explained how they are really making money, except the fact that to join them we would need to buy an NFT, and there were 10 different levels of them, starting from 100 euros, each costing more than the previos and having more benefits going up in price. If we were to join we would be tutored by a professional and supposedly make money by staking on crypto, but they said that the real money is made by recruiting others to buy those NFTs: whenever we recruit someone we would get a percentage kickback on their purchase of the NFT.

They recommended to buy the one that costs 1500 euros, around the middle of the pack. They said that it can be liquidated and 50% of the money would be turned directly into cryptocurrency, and the fact that we can easily make 1500 euros back in a month by recruiting some people and with the staking.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

password + salt -> bcrypt -> stored password hash & salt value in db

when user login, will use bcrypt on the plaintext password and the stored salt value to make sure the hash match with the one in database.

file encryption:  
generate pbkdf2 derived password from main password + salt value (the same one in db) -> this derived key then be used for aes file encryption / decryption key

For the sake of simplicity, I am using the same salt value in the database for both authentication and pdkdf2 aes key generation, I think it's safe, just wanted a second opinion. Thanks",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 18:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments.

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {

        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,Most Used Languages to Program Cryptography in Production?,2024-07-25 05:04:31,"Hello Everyone.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 16:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-19 00:49:29.883075
