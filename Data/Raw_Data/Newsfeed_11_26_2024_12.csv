Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible",2024-11-26 12:00:02+00:00,"The Bitcoin price could crash if it fails to hold key resistance levels. A crypto analyst has revealed that a decline to $89,000 was well within possibility, as sell-offs below the $100,000 mark have continued to hinder Bitcoin’s price upward momentum.  Bitcoin Price Correction To $89,000 Possible On November 26, TradingView crypto analyst Pejman Zwin shared a detailed chart representing a technical analysis of Bitcoin‘s price movements in a 1-hour time frame. The Bitcoin price chart highlighted vital resistance lines, support zones, and technical indicators suggesting an impending crash.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Extends Rally – Can This Lead To A Breakout Above $0.82? At the top of the price chart is a yellow zone identified as the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ), where Bitcoin is expected to face significant resistance as it aims for the $100,000 milestone. The chart also highlights a horizontal resistance line of around $95,904, which Bitcoin previously struggled to break. At current resistance levels between $97,000 and $98,000, Zwin has indicated that if Bitcoin can successfully push above these thresholds, its price could rise significantly towards $100,000. On the other hand, Bitcoin could experience a massive price decline if it fails to reach the resistance levels mentioned above. The analyst’s price chart showcases green zones representing critical support cones where Bitcoin could bounce back if its price corrects.  If Bitcoin drops below support levels between $95,600 and $92,000 and breaks the lower line of the ascending channel on its chart, Zwin has forecasted that its price could crash as low as $89,000 this bull cycle. The analyst describes this crash point as the “cumulative long liquidation leverage, where Bitcoin could see its price correcting between $91,000 and $89,000, representing an 8% to 10% crash for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Key Factors Pushing The BTC Price Upwards On the flip side, Zwin disclosed in his Bitcoin analysis report that the cryptocurrency is pumping again, driven by a wave of positive market sentiment sparked by recent developments in the crypto space that have been headlines. The analyst revealed that the news of the Chinese Court affirming the legality of Bitcoin and crypto ownership has been a key catalyst behind the sharp rise in the price of BTC. Related Reading: ETH/BTC’s 8-Year Cycle Chart Shows How High Ethereum Price Can Go This Cycle Additionally, Donald Trump‘s plans to appoint a White House crypto advisor have provided a significant boost to the BTC price, propelling it to current levels and enabling it to break through important resistance lines.  Based on the above chart, Zwin reveals that Bitcoin has entered five new impulsive waves from the Elliott wave theory. This bullish development occurred after the cryptocurrency broke past key resistance lines.  Moreover, Zwin’s Bitcoin price chart showcases a “Bump and Run Top Pattern,” with the cryptocurrency already completing the “Bump phase” and entering a “Run phase.” Taking this into consideration, the analyst has predicted that if Bitcoin can surge above $98,700, investors and market watchers should expect it to skyrocket to $100,000.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

In his latest video, crypto analyst Rodney (@cryptojourneyrs) shared an analysis of the price potential in the post-Gensler era. At the time of his analysis, XRP was trading at $1.43, reflecting a remarkable 172% increase over the past month. The market capitalization had soared to $81 billion, accompanied by $22 billion in daily trading volume. “XRP is starting to return to its normal spot in crypto, being one of the dominant altcoins,” Rodney remarked. Why XRP Is Poised To Surge Higher In his video, Rodney suggests that Trump’s promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office may have influenced Gensler’s decision to resign preemptively. “Gary Gensler is going to be stepping down from his role as the chair of the SEC January 20th, the same day Trump is going to be inaugurated,” Rodney stated. “Trump promised to fire Gary Gensler on day one, so I think Gary Gensler wanted to go out on his shield and resign on his own.” Related Reading: XRP Analyst Sets $2 Target If It Holds Key Level – Can It Reach Multi-Year Highs? Reflecting on the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, Rodney noted the significant impact it had on the price and market perception. “When the SEC sued Ripple, [XRP] price dipped 50%. This was one of many lawsuits that the SEC and Gary Gensler filed against many different crypto projects. It seemed like they were trying to regulate the space out of existence,” Rodney stated. He pointed out that despite the legal challenges, XRP remained a top cryptocurrency. “Even through all the BS, XRP has still been a top crypto and it really hasn’t fallen out of the top 10 in many years,” he said. Rodney also discussed Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC in July 2023, which set a significant precedent in the crypto industry. However, he expressed surprise that the price did not react more positively at the time. “When we heard about that news of them partially beating the SEC, XRP started to pump to around $0.67 but then promptly dipped down to about $0.50 and didn’t really do anything,” he observed. “It wasn’t moving with the cryptocurrency market at all… It was a running joke that it was kind of our favorite stablecoin.” Turning to the political landscape, Rodney explained: “Donald Trump actually ended up destroying Kamala Harris and is going to be the next president of the United States,” he stated. He emphasized Trump’s pro-crypto stance, noting that he was “much more open about supporting crypto” and was “the first president to purchase anything with cryptocurrency.” Rodney highlighted the involvement of various crypto projects in political campaigns, mentioning that “many cryptocurrency products were funding both candidates’ campaigns behind the scenes.” Related Reading: XRP To Hit $40 In 3 Months But On This Condition – Analyst With the political shift, Rodney expressed optimism about the future integration of cryptocurrency into government systems. “Now more than ever, it seems like cryptocurrency is going to be involved with our government, and in my opinion, XRP is going to be up there with the top projects,” he asserted. He elaborated on XRP’s core objectives, stating, “What is XRP trying to do? They want to be used for international money transfers […] They want to enable fast and low-cost international money transfers and currency exchanges.” He suggested that with supportive figures in government, XRP could realize this potential. How High Can XRP Price Go? Rodney also delved into his price predictions for XRP, considering various market capitalization scenarios. If XRP were to achieve Ethereum’s market cap of approximately $400 billion, it would result in a 4.9x increase from its current price, bringing XRP to around $6.98. “Say, for example, XRP becomes a part of our government and we actually use it for its real utility. Everyone uses it, and it magically got the same market cap size of Ethereum,” he speculated. Imagining XRP reaching Bitcoin’s market cap of about $2 trillion, he calculated a 24x increase, which would place XRP at approximately $33. “Let’s fantasize a little crazier […] Say we gave it Bitcoin’s market cap size that’s currently sitting around $2 trillion,” he mused. He considered a $10 XRP, corresponding to a $600 billion market cap, as a reasonable possibility. “I think that a $10 XRP or an XRP with a $600 billion market cap size is reasonable,” he concluded. However, Rodney acknowledged the challenges inherent in these predictions, noting that “it would be tough for any cryptocurrency project to hit those market cap sizes because Bitcoin’s dominating the entire market right now.” At press time, XRP traded at $1.40.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Crypto Bloodbath: Over $500 Million Liquidated As Bitcoin Slides To $92K – Report,2024-11-26 09:00:19+00:00,"In the last few days, there have been big changes in crypto land. In just 24 hours, more than $550 million was liquidated. When Bitcoin fell to its weekly low, it caused a flood of sell-offs that caused about 170,000 traders to lose money on their accounts. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ATH Sparks $309 Price Prediction Frenzy – Details Coinglass reports such tremendous losses to be placed at $118 million in BTC longs, $54 million in ETH longs, and even $25 million in Dogecoin long positions. This surge in liquidations, in conjunction with a decrease in market capitalization and trading volume, emphasizes the volatility that traders have come to anticipate. This is perceived by analysts as a component of a more extensive pattern of corrections that have occurred in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent rally to near-record levels. Bitcoin Dominance & Liquidation Trends Bitcoin’s dominance remains robust, with a current market capitalization of $3.23 trillion, which accounts for over 56% of the total crypto market. The highest liquidation of the day was a $4.67 million BTC/USDT exchange on Binance, which is indicative of the high stakes involved in leveraged trading. Additionally, altcoins were not spared. Significant declines were observed in tokens with a smaller market capitalization, with the broader market losing approximately $100 million. Some analysts think this is just another usual correction, following the hefty close to 44% rise in Bitcoin price since early November. At present, the crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 82, suggesting that the prevailing dominance in the market is still “Extreme Greed.” Ethereum And Altcoins Maintain Their Poise Ethereum remains resilient, despite the fact that it was not spared from the day’s losses. The uncertain sentiment surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency was underscored by a combination of long and short liquidations in ETH positions. In the interim, altcoins such as Dogecoin, which were frequently bolstered by meme-driven enthusiasm, experienced the repercussions of market corrections, a warning to traders who were seeking rapid profits. An industry analyst named Miles Deutscher noticed that more traders are reactivating their wallets after not using them for months. They are doing this because they are interested in the possibility of altcoins and Bitcoin’s strong performance. As the market continues to follow its usual trends, this increase in activity could lead to both growth and volatility. Related Reading: XRP Below $1?

The next action divides analysts; some believe the market is ready for consolidation prior to another surge beyond $100,000. Others caution that overlevers may cause short-term greater volatility. Investors are keenly monitoring market mood and macroeconomic factors. Although current conditions may promote bullish momentum, the crypto market’s severe price volatility and huge leverage risks remind us of its unpredictable nature.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained",2024-11-26 07:30:06+00:00,"After reaching a new all-time high of $99,600 last Friday, the Bitcoin price has retraced to the $94,000 mark for the first time in nearly a week. This pullback comes amid growing speculation about a possible correction following a massive three-week uptrend that saw the leading crypto surge by 40% after Donald Trump’s election on November 5. Bitcoin Price May Drop To $70,500 Market expert and technical analyst Rekt Capital recently voiced concerns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), drawing parallels with historical price cycles. He highlighted that in the 2013 cycle, the Bitcoin price experienced six weeks of rising prices leading into what is known as “Price Discovery,” followed by its first major correction in Week 7.  Similarly, in the 2017 cycle, a seven-week rally culminated in a significant retracement of 34% in Week 8. In the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin rallied for six weeks before facing its first meaningful pullback of 16%.Currently, Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin is in the fourth week of its current uptrend.  Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance Based on these historical patterns, it suggests that the cryptocurrency may be poised for a retest of lower support levels within the next two to four weeks, aligning  with the previous trends, where the average declines have been substantial. Considering the data from past corrections, the Bitcoin price could experience a 25% pullback, potentially bringing the price down to around $70,500—a level not seen since the election day.  Who’s Selling Bitcoin? Contributing to the current pullback, data from on-chain market intelligence firm Glassnode reveals that long-term holders (LTHs) have significantly increased their selling activity, with a notable selling pressure recorded at -366,000 BTC per month—the highest level seen since April 2024.  The analysis indicates that among long-term holders, the 6 to 12-month cohort is leading the charge, averaging 25,600 BTC sold per day. This group of investors has capitalized on the recent Bitcoin price surge, having acquired their coins at an average cost basis approximately 71% lower than the current market price, which hovers around $57,900.  Related Reading: Rocket Fuel For Shiba Inu Price: Kusama Says 99% SHIB Supply Burn Possible The increase in selling pressure among this group also reflects a potential shift in market movement in the coming days. With Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs just below $100,000, some investors may choose to take profits rather than ride out potential volatility.  At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $94,000, recording a retracement of nearly 5% on the 24-hour time frame.  For the time being, however, the Bitcoin price continues to post gains in all other time frames, with the year-to-date being the most notable with a 150% surge in that time period.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Polygon: Analyst Sets ‘Wild’ Price Target Amid POL’s 38.2% Weekly Surge,2024-11-26 06:30:11+00:00,"Polygon (POL) hit its four-month high today following its 11% daily surge. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $0.60 mark before retracing, sparking a bullish sentiment among investors and market watchers. As a result, a renowned crypto analyst predicted a massive 2,500% rally for POL in the coming months. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Rebounds Above $6: Is A Sustainable Rally In Sight? Polygon On-Chain Metrics Turn Bullish Polygon has seen a remarkable performance over the past three weeks, rising around 107% since the November 5 market pump. POL, previously MATIC, has seen its price move from below the $0.30 mark to a four-month high of $0.61. This performance has been fueled by several factors, which have propelled the token’s price by nearly 40% in the last seven days and could stage “one of the most hated rallies,” as Ali Martinez shared on X. The analyst explained that Polygon has been experiencing an “important spike in on-chain metrics” over the last week, which could drive POL’s price to a “wild” price action in the future. Martinez noted that a lot of investors hold Polygon from the previous cycle, where the project’s token hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.92. However, most of them record losses since only 15.11% of Polygon holders are in the green. Per the post, this is a positive sign for POL’s price action, as most of its investors won’t sell for profit at the current price ranges. The analyst added that on-chain data suggests a new wave of investors are positioning themselves for the rally’s second leg. This was signaled by the recent increase in daily active addresses, transaction volume, and whale activity. POL’s daily trading volume has recorded a 190% increase in the last week, jumping from the $250 million mark to $736 million. Additionally, whales bought over 140 million POL, now worth around nearly $80 million, in the last week and a half, with large-scale purchases significantly increasing since November 5. POL To Hit $15 This Cycle? Martinez suggested that with the whales’ buying spree and the reduced selling pressure, the POL “technicals look very good.” To him, the cryptocurrency is nearing a breakout from a multi-year descending triangle. The analyst explained that Polygon has been consolidating in a descending triangle formation since hitting its ATH almost three years ago. Nearly a week ago, the token “bounced off the triangle’s x-axis,” and had its Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) “on the verge of a bullish crossover.” This suggested that while sentiment remains overall bearish, “bullish signals are piling up,” indicating a potential rally toward a new ATH. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance Based on this, Martinez predicted that POL’s breakout could potentially lead to a 2,500% rally in the coming months. A weekly close above $0.7973 could spark a rally to $15.27, he detailed, adding that it could also ignite a 6,200% jump to $36.17. The analyst added that the most important support wall for POL was between the $0.375 and $0.386 price range, broken over a week ago, with little resistance in the higher levels. As of this writing, POL is trading at $0.58, a 75% increase in the monthly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

The price is holding the $625 support and might aim for a move above the $660 resistance. BNB price started a downside correction from the $685 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $660 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $625 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a close above the $640 level, BNB price extended its increase. However, upsides were limited above $685 and the price remained capped, unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $666 and $650 levels. However, the price is now holding gains above the $625 level. A low was formed at $626 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $676 swing high to the $626 low. The price is now trading below $650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $650 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $676 swing high to the $626 low. The next resistance sits near the $660 level. There is also a key declining channel forming with resistance at $660 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. A clear move above the $660 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $676. A close above the $676 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $685 resistance.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Rally Pauses Before $100K—Here’s What Could Happen Next,2024-11-26 05:00:15+00:00,"Bitcoin recently came close to breaking the $100,000 price mark last week, reaching a high of $99,645 before encountering resistance. According to CryptoQuant analyst Percival, the psychological barrier of round numbers like $100,000 often serves as a point where traders exit positions for “relative safety.” Since climbing from $73,000 to $99,800, Percival highlighted that Bitcoin has recorded a roughly 57% gain, ranking it among the ‘top six exit rallies from consolidation zones.’ Despite this, the CryptoQuant analyst suggests that Bitcoin may enter a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation? BTC Faces Resistance Below $100K: What Lies Ahead? Percival emphasized the significance of the Choppiness Index, a metric that gauges market momentum. According to him, the index indicates that Bitcoin’s rally is losing strength weekly. This suggests the cryptocurrency could consolidate for several weeks before another rally begins. Analyzing previous market cycles, particularly in 2020, Percival noted that Bitcoin’s first post-consolidation correction lasted approximately three weeks, with an 18% price drop. If history repeats, the next rally may occur in the latter half of December. The analyst also pointed to Long-Term Holder (LTH) behavior as a critical factor in understanding Bitcoin’s current market dynamics. LTHs are currently seeing 350% in profit and are in a supply distribution phase, with approximately 575,000 Bitcoins (worth around $58 billion) re-entering the market. Despite this, demand has remained strong, driven by inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and purchases from institutional players like MicroStrategy. Using the STH Realized Profit and Loss metric, Percival further explored Short-Term Holder (STH) activity. He noted that short-term holders account for 30.2% of the profits recorded during this phase. Additionally, Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has exceeded 1.33σ, signaling that the average token is approaching the 1.4σ zone, corresponding to 40% unrealized profits. Historically, this zone aligns with the first correction following a significant rally, as observed in late 2020. What to Expect Next for Bitcoin Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s trajectory may depend on several factors, including the pace of its consolidation phase and the behavior of institutional and retail investors. If the current consolidation period mirrors the patterns of previous cycles, Bitcoin could stabilize before attempting another push beyond $100,000. However, short-term corrections may still occur with LTHs continuing to take profits and STHs remaining active.

This suggests that, despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains promising. When writing, BTC trades for $96,353, up slightly by 0.3% in the past day, with a current market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.

The price must clear the $1.50 resistance zone to start a fresh increase in the near term. XRP price is attempting a fresh increase from the $1.300 level. The price is now trading near $1.450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair is showing positive signs and might eye a fresh increase above the $1.50 resistance. XRP Price Holds Gains XRP price formed a base above $1.30 and started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1.350 and $1.42 resistance levels. It even pumped above the $1.45 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin in the past two sessions. The price spiked above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $1.50 resistance zone. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading near $1.45 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.4680 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.50 level. The next key resistance could be $1.550 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.6340 swing high to the $1.3007 low. A clear move above the $1.550 resistance might send the price toward the $1.6350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.680 resistance or even $1.6850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.720 or $1.750. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $1.50 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.400 level and the triangle’s lower trend line. The next major support is near the $1.380 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.380 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.3200 support. The next major support sits near the $1.2650 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $1.4000 and $1.3800. Major Resistance Levels – $1.5000 and $1.5500.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

So far in November, Solana-based DEXes have recorded over $100 billion in trading volume, marking a major milestone for the ecosystem. Solana DeFi Ecosystem Gains Momentum, Outshines Ethereum DeFi Solana, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a reported market cap of $118.34 billion has been on a record-breaking price trajectory. Recently, the digital asset established a new all-time-high (ATH) of $263 after having hit as low as $8 at the peak of the FTX fiasco. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Bulls Stay in Control: Rally Far From Over? Now, the layer-1 blockchain has achieved another milestone as Solana-based DEXes surpassed $100 billion for the first time in monthly trading volume. According to data from DefiLlama, the 30-day cumulative trading volume recorded by Solana DEXes stands at $116.51 billion. In comparison, Ethereum mainnet-based DEXes saw $61.61 billion in trading volume during the same period. This means Solana’s DEX trading volume was more than double that of Ethereum’s. On a month-over-month (MoM) basis, Solana’s DEX volume surged over 100% from October, which stood at $52.5 billion. Meanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has increased to $9.30 billion, up from $6.23 billion a month ago. The unprecedented rise in Solana-based DEX trading volume can be attributed to several factors. These include the ongoing memecoin frenzy, the blockchain’s low transaction fees, and an intuitive user interface. It is worth highlighting that Solana’s TVL has yet to surpass its ATH TVL of $10.02 billion, which was recorded almost three years ago in November 2021. In January 2023, the blockchain’s TVL hit a low of $210 million, dragged down by the wider crypto bear market exacerbated by the downfall of FTX exchange. At the time of writing, $3.58 billion of Solana’s TVL is tied to the liquid staking protocol Jito, while Jupiter DEX holds $2.4 billion. Another prominent Solana-based DEX, Raydium, accounts for $2.37 billion of TVL. Where Is SOL Headed? Solana’s growing user adoption has played a crucial role in driving the recovery of its native token, SOL. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, SOL has gained over 157%, rising from $101 on January 1 to $263 on November 23. Related Reading: Solana Records New ATH After 3 Years: Is SOL Ready To Flip USDT? Despite such extraordinary returns, crypto experts remain bullish on SOL, expecting further gains for the digital asset. According to a recent analysis by Titan of Crypto, SOL may hit $400 as it appears to be breaking out from a prolonged cup-and-handle pattern. Additional bullish factors, such as the declining Bitcoin (BTC) dominance and the rising likelihood of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), could further propel SOL to new highs. SOL trades at $248.31 at press time, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from DefiLlama.com and Tradingview.com",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Reddit,solana,Losing all your money to memecoins?  The problem may be that you're bringing a knife to a bot fight.,2024-11-26 00:18:48,"I've been around awhile, and recently moved from ETH to SOL. The first thing I noticed was that SOL charts just didn't add up. Too many dips turned to capitulation, too many non-sensical buys and sells. So I started researching....

I think maybe people don't realize how big the bot problem is on Solana. Tbf, no one does. The pseudonymous nature of the blockchain makes it nearly impossible to judge. But we know it's bad, so here's a post on why bots may be harvesting you for liquidity.

First, the types of bots we're talking about:

1. Front-Running Bots: Spot big buys and jump in first to profit.
2. Sandwich Bots: Abuse slippage, effectively rob you by buying before your transaction and selling right after
3. Sniping Bots: Buy before you and then sell to you at a higher price—some of you probably use these
4. Trend Bots: Spot breakouts or patterns on charts and act fast. These are stealthy.
5. Scam Bots: Manipulate the market to suppress price movement.
6. Chart Painting Bots: Fake trends on charts to trick investors into buying.

\-------------

**How do we know bots are so common?**

Well, if you designed a blockchain optimized for hosting bots and hiding their activity, it would probably look a lot like Solana. Low fees, no tax, a confusing blockchain structure, no penalties, and tons of highly volatile coins make it a literal botters paradise. I'm fairly confident there's not a blockchain more suited for bots.

**How bad is it?**

• In March 2024, during Solana’s frequent outages, 93% of failed transactions were from bots.

• \*\*In July, Solana had 1.3 million active wallets vs. Ethereum’s 300,000. The average Solana wallet had 217 transactions, compared to less than 3 on Ethereum.\*\*

• Many who have dived into this issue believe that Solana's meteoric rise has been mostly bot-driven.

**Why don’t you notice them?**

You do. You see it all the time, you just don't know how to spot it. This is speculation, but those big price swings that's earned SOL users the rep for dumping could be bots triggering each other’s stop-losses in a chain reaction.

And those “Bump bots” that keep tokens visible on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) that everyone says are required to launch mooners? Well, a flood of transactions with little price movement often signals a breakout, which makes it kinda likely that bump bots are false-triggering short term trading bots, and that's where the extra volume comes from.

\----------

It's very possible, maybe even probable, that the reality of the situation is that we're in an automated high-tech Bot vs Bot meatgrinder, with the equivalent of a slingshot to defend ourselves.

The memecoin game is ruthless, and it’s not just you versus other traders—it’s you versus devs, influencers, and an entire army of bots, all fighting for the same scraps. when you factor in how much bots can manipulate everything from prices to volume, it’s no wonder the odds feel stacked against you.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

On Solana the total amount of USDC minted has reached $3.32 billion

Now Wanchain has made it possible for users to transfer their USDC directly between Cardano and Solana. Is this just the beginning of what Wanchain plans to do with their bridges between these 2 major ecosystems? What are your thoughts on seeing SOL on Cardano? What use cases could there be?

Reddit,solana,How to learn about crypto memecoins trading and other stuff ?,2024-11-26 04:50:47,"I’m a newbie and started participating in airdrops on Telegram about 3-4 months ago, thanks to a friend. He told me he earns money from it, and I saw his earnings—about $650 from Telegram airdrops. That’s a huge amount for me since I’m from India, and he uses only free methods to earn this.

So, I joined Telegram airdrops like TapTap projects and completed projects like Hamster, X Empir, Rocky Rabbit, and Major. Currently, I’m working on Blum, ToMarket, and a few others.

From my experience, I’ve realized that these projects aren’t necessarily bad, but they heavily favor people who can pay for stars or TON. While I’m not accusing them of being unfair, it’s clear that paying users have an advantage, which makes the system feel unequal for others, like everyone is working here and contributing something they should pay something for that but the payment is too low for what are we working for.

Recently, my friend told me that Telegram-based projects aren’t as rewarding anymore. He recommended trying testnet and DeNet projects instead. I’ve started exploring some DeNet projects, but I also want to properly understand how all these things work. I’m curious about:

What blockchain is and how it works.

What is memepad

What is solana and ton ecosystem 

What is pocektfi, how it works 

How to master charts 

How to research 

How to be up to date

Where to find Better projects 

How to find better projects.

How to identify meme coins that could rise 100x.

How to trade meme coins correctly.

And anything else that could help me become a successful meme coin trader.


The problem is, I don’t know where to begin. There are tons of YouTube videos, but I’m not sure what to learn first and in what order.

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Reddit,solana,Tips for telegram calls and trading bots,2024-11-26 03:14:30,"I want to make my own bot. 

It's nothing new, but I find myself inherently distrusting existing bots.

I've been following a few telegram channels for a while that make calls and post updates, but can never get the timing right to act on them. Generally they are fast moving and high yield, but if you don't buy/sell within seconds of the call, you either missed it or lost on the trade. 

To that end, I want to use the telegram api and dexscreener api to make a bot that just executes these trades on a dedicated wallet. 

Is appreciate any tips if anyone else has done something like this, or knows more about the api tools. 

I went to school for programming, but a) didn't graduate, moved over to art/animation, and b) it's been a little while. 

I'm comfortable programming in python and http, which seems to be all I need, but I'd still appreciate any tips if you've got them.

A few months ago, I wrote a script that monitored the blockchain for Raydium pool creations. Back then, I noticed that there were almost no unruggable coins or honeypots, meaning:

1. Mint/Freeze was disabled.
2. LP tokens were burned.
3. 60% or more of the total token supply was locked in the pool.

Before I invest time polishing the code, I thought I’d ask here about the current situation.

Reddit,solana,Telegram Scammers Draining My Solana. ,2024-11-25 22:32:50,"Alright, I've been trading for about a month, and learned a ton. Mostly what NOT to do. 

I've been trading using BullX, although I do my research using other platforms such as DEXscreener, X, and all that other stuff. 

However, my Telegram or BullX keep getting hacked. It has happened twice now in a short period of time. 

The FIRST time, I was BRAND NEW to crypto day trading. I was researching Solana coins, investing like .2 sol, getting rugged, all the dumb s\*\*\*, but I was just trying to learn. After some time, I made my first decent trade, it was a 5x. I made about 2 Sol profit, and was stoked. However, as soon as I got out of the trade, and went to bed, someone got into my BullX and added a withdrawal wallet before I could delete it. I woke up to everything being gone. So I took that as a learning opportunity. I realized the only way they must've gotten in was through an encrypted Telegram link off of a memecoins X, or DEX. So, I deleted my Telegram and wiped everything. 

The SECOND time, I made a new Telegram and a new BullX. I made sure to set up 2FA, hide all my info, create super strong passwords, etc. Also, now I knew what those f\*\*\*ers could do. I was always cautious of clicking Telegrams, and I never joined any without having some sort of authorization, etc. However, obviously I clicked something I shouldn't have, and they got in again. Although, this time my Telegram app on my phone would give me notifications for BullX. So I saw a new wallet was added, and it obviously wasn't mine so I deleted it. This happened about 10 times, they kept adding new ones, and I'd delete it. I had my wallet added, and they kept deleting MINE (so I couldn't withdraw my own Sol). So after a while, they said f\*\*\* it and put ALL of my Sol into a random low cap s\*\*\*coin. I think it must've been one they made, because they bought and sold until everything was gone, and periodically, matching the transactions from my account the Dev would buy and sell. So I think they were just farming me because they couldn't simply withdraw my Solana. Once everything was gone they added a wallet named ""you made me lose 1 solana on fees :("", and another named ""on telegram with @yasuke. My name is kevin saudi ura do"". 

So this f\*\*\*er stole around 6 Solana from my account the second time, and the first time they stole 3 Solana. Which isn't a lot but I know they do this all day. They probably steal hundreds of peoples' Solana. 

Anyways, I just wanted to make a post to let people know. There isn't any info out there I could really find about this. So be careful, don't click anything you don't 100% trust and know, and maybe don't use BullX or Telegram. 

I made a wallet called ""God knows what you did. I wish the best for you"" so, I hope he can really sit and think about what a f\*\*\* he is lol. God will judge him, not me. 

Alright, let me hear what you guys have to say!

# Settlement and Data Availability (DA)

>From a users perspective, [@ZetaMarkets](https://x.com/@ZetaMarkets) will be a non-custodial, highly liquid and seamless to use derivatives + spot + lending platform. Under the hood, it runs atop [@bulletxyz\_](https://x.com/@bulletxyz_), an optimistic Solana rollup built on Sovereign SDK.This means that we post all of our data to Solana, and will have a zk-fraud proofs secured optimistic bridge with Solana. This allows us to inherit the safety and censorship-resistance of Solana’s 1000+ validator set by anchoring our rollup state to the base layer. Also, this will allow us to tap into the generous data capacity that will come online with the shift to Frankendancer/Firedancer on the Solana network.As far as we're aware, we're the first team to ever do this.

>Our decision to use Solana for DA is a bet on the base chain being architected in an incredibly scalable manner. We believe that blockspace, storage and data costs should only improves as Solana scales with rapid advancements in hardware and software (i.e. Moore's Law). By using the same chain for settlement and DA we dramatically simplify our architecture, and reduce the need for complex bridging and messaging overhead between two separate layers that usually end up inheriting the worst security properties of both chains used.

## DA Implementation - Solestia

>Our DA adapter enables the sequencer to pack a batch of Zeta X (and eventually other) transactions into a Solana transaction as pure bytes (a ""blob"" if you must). On-chain, this batch of transaction bytes gets hashed so that our smart contract on Solana holds a ""data-root"" specific to our application. Referring to this data-root, a zk-proof can both prove the new transactions for the Solana block and, by combining them with the previous state root, prove the new state.

# Sequencer

>Our sequencer is designed specifically for realtime blockchain UX. [@sovereign\_labs](https://x.com/@sovereign_labs) have architected their framework for soft-confirmations from the ground-up rather than trying to morph an existing Ethereum/Solana node that is built to produce blocks.We have a unique “streaming” model that gives drastically increased performance and allows our sequencers can respond on a per tx basis. This makes it a game-changer for real-time trading platforms like [@ZetaMarkets](https://x.com/@ZetaMarkets). To that end, we have already managed to achieve sub 50ms latency on our sequencer, and have a number of known optimizations which we are confident can get us to sub 5ms latency (faster than most CEXs). 

[https://x.com/Tristan0x/status/1853760081638441450](https://x.com/Tristan0x/status/1853760081638441450)

## Credible neutrality

>Centralized/preferred sequencer designs often cop a lot of flack from the decentralization maximalism crowd; however, we are taking a number of steps to maintain censorship resistance in our setup. Transactions submitted by non-preferred sequencers (which anyone can run) are expected to be promptly included by the preferred sequencer—ideally within a few Solana blocks (i.e. a few seconds). This urgency arises because if the preferred sequencer fails to include these transactions within a specified timeframe (12 hours), it loses its stake (slashing) and its ability to provide soft confirmations - and the rollup processes all forced transactions and becomes a based rollup.Delaying submission exposes the preferred sequencer to data availability (DA) issues, such as censorship or other availability problems, which could ultimately prevent it from processing these transactions on time. This risk, along with the transparency of all delays on-chain, serves as a deterrent against procrastination for the preferred sequencer.

# Proofs

>[@bulletxyz\_](https://x.com/@bulletxyz_) will launch initially as an optimistic rollup that will come with zk fraud proofs on day one. This means that block production will run ahead unhindered, however if anyone spots cases of misbehaviour they can challenge the malicious node and if successful, have them slashed. Our design is a significant improvement over previous generation of optimistic rollups (including Optimism and Arbitrum) which rely on running an on-chain bisection game over an execution trace to resolve disputes about the rollup state, whereas ours use single-round proofs. Concretely this means that the bridging time into the rollup will be a matter of seconds (depending on the chosen confirmation level of Solana L1), whilst bridging out of the rollup will take roughly 12h at present (the optimistic challenge window which can be adjusted based on risk tolerance).Over time as [zk proving costs and proof generation times continue to decrease rapidly](https://x.com/SuccinctLabs/status/1849575345235833170), we also have the option to transition to a full-blown zk-rollup, meaning each block would be proven, and hence allowing us to get our bridging out time down to a matter of minutes (and maybe one day real-time!).

## Why Now?

>The magic of why an exchange like Zeta X has not been built before is down to monumental advances in zero knowledge cryptography, specifically the proliferation of general purpose zkVMs like [@RiscZero](https://x.com/@RiscZero) and [@SuccinctLabs](https://x.com/@SuccinctLabs). These allow us to write sophisticated, Rust-based programs which compile down to a RISC-V instruction set, and have proofs of that computation generated alongside (with no need to write complex custom circuits). This lets us benefit from the state of the art in Ethereum scaling research without needing to hire a team of math PhDs (I never had the patience to do a PhD anyway). 

[https://x.com/BruestleJeremy/status/1857085834706518320](https://x.com/BruestleJeremy/status/1857085834706518320)

https://preview.redd.it/y7sxe2zpk53e1.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=de454e7cf8a0b93e036654a430b13d98fdac7f93

>The beauty here is that we can scale applications like Zeta X massively by running the orderbook off-chain, yet retain strong guarantees that said computation (e.g. every update to the orderbook) is verifiably correct. This is a fundamentally different way of building application-specific chains (”network extensions”) without having to hand roll your own L1 and rely on a small, co-located set of validators to maintain a speed advantage.

# Virtual Machine (VM)

>We are VM-less, and one of the few to have made this choice! This lets us have ultimate flexibility when it comes to building lightning fast DeFi experiences.This is often a point of confusion for many, who assume Bullet is a SVM rollup (like Eclipse or Atlas). The distinction between the two is that our rollup runs without any VM and settles on Solana, whereas the latter run a Solana Virtual Machine instance but settle it on Ethereum, a pronounced difference.This choice enables us to be purely focused on our application, without being hindered by the complexities or intricacies of regular blockchain development. We have no strict compute or account limits, no specific RFCs to support human readable transactions, we provide standard REST APIs out of the box similar to CEXs, to name a few benefits.

# Database (DB)

>Currently, the access of state information is the biggest throughput bottleneck in blockchains today. Sovereign SDK already shares a state-of-the-art library with the Penumbra team called JMT  that was [initially developed by the Diem team](https://developers.diem.com/papers/jellyfish-merkle-tree/2021-01-14.pdf). However, for the past 8 months, they've been working with Polkadot co-founder [@rphmeier](https://x.com/@rphmeier) in building what they believe will be a nearly optimal state database optimized for blockchains. We plan on migrating from JMT to NOMT DB as soon as its ready and battle-tested.For our users, this will mean that data capacity will be the only constraint for throughput (NOMT v1 can comfortably handle 40k TPS with 128M accounts assuming random worst case access), and as Solana scales, we should be able to provide free transactions and throughput at the levels of existing CEXs.For more of the details you can check out [Rob's recent talk from Polkadot sub0](https://x.com/rphmeier/status/1856179088865800466), or read [@prestonevans\_\_](https://x.com/@prestonevans__)'s [brilliant blog](https://sovereign.mirror.xyz/jfx_cJ_15saejG9ZuQWjnGnG-NfahbazQH98i1J3NN8) that kickstarted the whole development (reader warning: very technical).

# Parallelization

>We’ll be starting with sequential execution, with a clear path to parallelization if execution becomes the bottleneck (currently it is not).

# Block size

>Our block size is theoretically as big as Solana (which is dynamic, but seems to be around 2000 txs/block and 1232 bytes per tx, i.e. \~2.5MB blocks). The nice thing is our rollup transaction sizes are considerably smaller that a Solana tx at \~200B, meaning we can fit roughly 6 rollup txs per Solana tx. Thanks to this rollup batching we can achieve better gas cost efficiency for the same effective level of trading throughput.

# Block time

>Since Bullet is built to be a *real-time blockchain*, the experience for end users of dapps is that their orders will be executed and a soft-confirmation issued within less than 5 milliseconds. This is the most indicative measure of user experience and potential “lag” on interactions.Less importantly, but for the sake of completeness, the rollup will periodically batch transactions once they have been sequenced, and propose that batch to the L1. This occurs periodically (right now every few seconds), but can be adjusted as need be. This does not influence the user experience for trading (since users talk directly to the sequencer which refers to the most advanced state of the rollup), but will mean that full-node view of the network runs a few seconds behind the sequencer.

*Lifecycle of a transaction (*[*https://sovereign-labs.github.io/sdk-contributors/transaction-lifecycle.html*](https://sovereign-labs.github.io/sdk-contributors/transaction-lifecycle.html)*)*

# Throughput

>By far the biggest bottleneck for us will be the DA throughput as opposed to our execution, that is to say, the rate at which we can post our rollup batches asynchronously onto Solana. Based on some initial tests we have been able to hit 100kB/s on Solana mainnet which comes out to around 500 independent user transactions per second (each of our rollup transactions are about 200 bytes). However, we can amortize much of call data overhead (comprised of the signature, public key, nonce and gas parameters) by allowing multiple orders to be bundled in the same transaction message (so a fixed 150 bytes + dynamic bytes representing the Vec<Order> of instructions). In the optimal case, a market maker could pack \~96 orders into one Solana transaction blob (which is not as crazy as it sounds given they often have to replace quotes across tens of markets, for many price levels, every second). Extrapolating to our current available bandwidth of 100kB/s means we could process 7840 exchange orders per second. In reality, over 90% of transactions on a typical exchange tend to be frequent maker place/cancel quoting, so I think it's fair to assume a high degree of transaction packing, alongside the stream of individual taker orders.As a fun comparison, and in the spirit of achieving a ""NASDAQ on-chain"" one day, [NASDAQ itself routinely processes 70,000 order, cancellations and trader per second](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0112/056.html).

Reddit,solana,What happens to cabal tokens after the P&D?,2024-11-26 00:46:56,"I'm following a now 12 day old meme coin released on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) that quickly went to 10m, back to 1m, back up to 10m and is now in crypto purgatory <1m with around 250k volume - but not dead dead yet. The narrative was really top tier and the on chain activity looked odd to me so I continued following it, and it's clear that insiders made a lot of $$ on the two P&Ds.

The token still has an active CTO and these insiders appear to be dwindling in terms of there supply, at least according to [GateKept.io](http://GateKept.io), and I am just wondering now what is the typical outcome for such a coin? There is still a lot of bot activity, still some diehard whales accumulating, still some scalping by the insiders with their remaining tokens (they mainly sell but do buy occasionally). Hundreds of bots, often brand new wallets, appear and buy $1000 and just seem to hodl it.

What does it all mean at this point? Can the token ever be allowed to grow organically now? Do cabals stick around or have they likely moved on?",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Reddit,solana,Starting something good - I think :-),2024-11-25 20:35:50,"Hey all, bit of a stab in the dark here.

I’ve been trading for a few weeks and made a few coins on pump fun and Orion tools to experiment. I’ve lost a fair bit of money learning, but hey! You have to learn somehow right?

I’m now looking for a small group of people to start a new community and a set of tokens to be slow released over the next few months.

I am aiming for transparency and to share my real identity and not rug or scam people. - which I think would go down well. I’ve started kick streaming and live streaming on pump fun.

I need people to help me with a solid plan to start and secure tokens that can be gainers over time.

If anyone is interested drop me a message.

Ideally I need:-
1) people who can help with artwork (I can build the website and socials etc, they’re almost done)
2) people who know the solana marketplace and coin creation process in depth (the process from pump fun to raydium after achieving bonding curves)
3) active community managers to can help spread the word once the plan is formalised

Let’s have some fun and make some wealth!

I dont remember clicking any sketchy links at all. If anything I might have joined a channel or two but I havent clicked any links in any channels that I can recall. My last bullx transaction was 4 months ago. I did recently just start checking things out again wanting to get back into trading. I changed my telegram password. How can I move forward? Is everything compromised or am I good to proceed as usual after logging out of all devices and resetting my telegram password. Should I make a new Bullx wallet as well. Cant hurt.

Turns out, the streams were causing chaos—tons of rug pulls happening in real-time as hype coins launched, and people FOMO’d in without a second thought.

On one hand, I get it: the streams were kinda fun to watch, and they brought some crazy volume to new launches. But let’s be real, they were also **a breeding ground for scams**. Devs would launch sketchy tokens, pump them live, and dump on everyone watching. Not to mention, the NSFW content wasn’t exactly helping the platform’s reputation.

With the livestreams gone, it feels like PF is focusing more on being a legit launchpad rather than a free-for-all. Personally, I think this is a step in the right direction for long-term trust, but I’m curious how others feel.

Did you enjoy the streams? Do you think shutting them down will actually reduce rug pulls, or will scammers just find other ways? Let’s hear it.

Reddit,ethereum,Best exchange to swap BTC to ETH,2024-11-25 18:18:30,"Hi everyone, I’m facing a bit of a challenge and would really appreciate your input.

I’ve been holding onto BTC for quite some time, mainly as a long-term store of value. Lately, though, I’ve been exploring Ethereum’s ecosystem and am fascinated by the staking opportunities and the diverse range of DeFi protocols. To take advantage of these, I’m considering converting some of my BTC into ETH, but I want to ensure the process is both secure and cost-efficient.

Here’s what’s most important to me:

1. **Security:** I’ve heard concerning stories about some platforms freezing assets or being hacked, so I’m prioritizing exchanges with a strong reputation for safety.
2. **Privacy:** While I value privacy, I’m open to light KYC requirements if needed. However, I’d prefer platforms where KYC isn’t mandatory for small-scale swaps.
3. **Fees:** I’d like to avoid excessive fees. Platforms with clear and reasonable fee structures are a big plus for me.

I’m debating whether to use a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase or opt for a decentralized solution. My hesitation with DEXs lies in potential slippage and overly complex interfaces. On the flip side, I’d prefer to limit the amount of personal information shared when using centralized platforms.

Do you have any recommendations for the best way to swap BTC for ETH based on these priorities? I’d love to hear your suggestions or experiences. Thanks in advance!",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Here's how it works.

>In a cowswap pseudo sandwich, mev bots are monitoring cowswap auction data, front running users before the auctions are completed... then selling after the auction is completed.

>It's not as great as a traditional sandwich bc it's a multiblock operation / bots do carry inventory risk... but when you know the future (what people are about to buy), it's pretty solid edge.

>How is this possible?  Well, the live auctions are available via a public api.  At the following endpoint, ANYONE can see user intents before solvers win competitions / execute orders.

>https://api.cow.fi/mainnet/api/v1/auction

>I noticed this when i was trying to use cowswap to buy kekec and some dbag kept buying before me the second i signed my cowswap order... then selling shortly after my order went through... or sometimes, even causing my order to fail bc his order pushed my order outside slippage tolerances.

>But if my intention was to buy fucking kekec... i'm going to resubmit my order right?  Well yeah that's what i did multiple times, and sure enough, this guy was ready to sell his front ran kekec the second my order actually executed.

I'm interested to hear people's opinions on this.

Reddit,ethereum,How to auto invest paycheck into crypto?,2024-11-25 23:20:36,"Hello Everyone,

I’m looking to invest a portion of my W2 Salary every month into a crypto portfolio.

To preface I’m still starting out with crypto so apologies if I say something dumb.

Every month on the 30th, I get my W2 direct deposit. I recently decided I’d like to take a small portion (let’s say 5%) and have it equally distributed across 5-10 coins I choose from.

Examples are: BTC, ETH, XRP, UNI, LINK, ADA, DOT.

If I invest let’s say $1,000 every month, I would want it equally divided by the amount of coins in the portfolio. For example in this example $1,000 / 8 = $125.

So $125 coins into every coin on the 30th every month. And it just keeps doing this automatically every month without me managing it. Similar to savings accounts, ira, etc.

Is there a way to do so? Which platform is best to do this that ideally has the least fees as I’ll be doing this monthly for several coins. Is there a preferred platform for this type of crypto investing? So far I’m looking at Kraken Pro.

Thank you all for your help in advance! 😊

TLDR; Looking for platform to auto invest direct deposit salary into crypto portfolio across several coins I choose.

Reddit,ethereum,What Problem Does Ethereum Solve 2024 Edition,2024-11-24 17:28:17,"I've been following this space for about 9 years.

Enough that I threw in some dollars and kind of just never let my ETH's go since 2016, a small DCA and then discipline to forget about it. I remember at some point ETH2 really sketched me out, and at one point I was nose keep in the literature and really understood the mechanics of it. Because of ETH, I am independently wealthy and pursue my career/passions without restrictions. My family is forever thankful for buying into the *Vision* of ETH.

Grown up the last 9 years, and am super thankful for learning about these communities early in my life. But I have also lived in the real world, work in technology / cybersecurity, even employed at a fintech company that implemented a crypto currency adjacent technology for ledger tracking and tokenization enabled workloads - but it was 100% isolated, private, and used by the company - for the company - built on top of a fork of a now popular cryptocurrency.

From a real world applied problem solving standpoint, I'm not stuck on either of the following questions - independently, I have strong answers. But together, I simply don't.

Which leads me to the following:

1. What problem does ethereum solve, AND
2. How is solving that problem going to lead to a financial gain or profit in holding ETH

There is the *Vision* of Etherum, and then there is the *Applied* nature of Ethereum in the real world outside of internet forums, discord, trading apps and reddit.

Honestly, I don't think the answer in solving these problems leads to ETH becoming more valuable. In fact, I think the opposite is true - the value would either:

have to stabilize and maintain a very low price for adoption , or , the application of ETH would be by private blockchains running completely independently from the main net, and businesses, corporations and government institutions peering and partnering between each other.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum: The Beautiful Death of Agility,2024-11-24 21:59:52,"*This post is taking part in the Devconflict_x Kiwi writing contest.*

The Ethereum community stands at a crossroads, yet it may not even realize it. Caught in the dazzling momentum of innovation, collaboration, and evolution, we risk forgetting the very foundation upon which this project was built: resilience. In our pursuit of agility, we may lose sight of a truth so fundamental it feels almost sacrilegious to say aloud:

**Ethereum needs to die to truly live.**

Not literally, of course, but in spirit. To fulfill its promise as the ""Internet of Value,"" Ethereum must embrace ossification as its ultimate goal. The base layer should become boring, invisible, and irrelevant to daily conversation—not because it has failed, but because it has succeeded so completely that it no longer requires attention. The irony is sharp: the greatest triumph of a decentralized system is the irrelevance of its community.

**The Case for Ossification**

Imagine a world where no one argues over the TCP/IP stack anymore. Why? Because it works. It's reliable, unchanging, and trusted to the point of invisibility. Ethereum should aspire to this state: a protocol so stable and robust that its functionality is no longer debated, no longer tinkered with, and no longer the subject of headlines. The innovation and experimentation we celebrate today belong elsewhere—to layer 2s, to applications, to higher abstractions that build upon the rock-solid foundation of Ethereum’s base layer.

Ossification isn’t just a technical necessity; it’s a moral imperative. Blockchain technology was born in hostile environments, designed to resist attack and inspire trust. Every change, every EIP, every tweak to the core protocol introduces risk—new surfaces for attack, new opportunities for exploitation. Trust isn’t built on agility. It’s built on stability. Ethereum’s long-term viability depends on its ability to stop changing.

And yet, the community seems hesitant. We cling to our roles as developers, researchers, and moderators. We celebrate the vibrant discourse and constant evolution of the protocol. But this beautiful collaboration, as precious as it is, must eventually end. Not in failure, but in transformation. The Ethereum of the future will thrive not because we’re actively improving it, but because it no longer needs improvement.

**Community and the Fear of Irrelevance**

This transformation requires an existential reckoning for the community. The moderators, developers, and active participants who shape Ethereum today must confront an uncomfortable truth: their work is temporary. Ossification means fewer EIPs, less debate, and, ultimately, a shrinking community. But this isn’t a cause for alarm—it’s a sign of success.

When activity on forums decline, when user engagement wanes, when the vibrant culture around Ethereum fades into the background, we shouldn’t mourn. We should celebrate. These are the growing pains of maturity, the inevitable consequence of becoming “good enough.”

But the current culture resists this idea. Moderators worry about declining engagement. Developers push for agility over stability. The community as a whole clings to its relevance. This resistance isn’t just a barrier to ossification—it’s a denial of Ethereum’s destiny.

**Automating Governance: A Path Forward**

One way to confront this resistance is by leading through example. The Ethereum community, with its emphasis on decentralization and trustless systems, is uniquely positioned to pioneer a new approach to governance—one that relies not on human discretion, but on automation.

Imagine a world where moderation on platforms like Reddit is handled not by humans but by large language models (LLMs). These models, trained on transparent and community-approved guidelines, could analyze every post and comment, assign confidence scores, and act based on predefined thresholds. This system wouldn’t ban users out of emotion or bias but based on clear, consistent criteria. Every action would be explained, every decision traceable. Moderators would shift from enforcers to observers, fine-tuning the system rather than wielding power.

This isn’t just a pipe dream—it’s achievable with today’s technology. Implementing such systems would set a powerful precedent, demonstrating how decentralized, automated governance can outperform traditional, centralized methods. It could serve as a model not just for Ethereum, but for political and social systems worldwide.

**The Death of Agility, the Birth of Trust**

Ossification isn’t the end of Ethereum—it’s the beginning of its true potential. By becoming boring, Ethereum becomes reliable. By fading into the background, it becomes indispensable. And by embracing its own irrelevance, the community ensures that Ethereum’s impact will endure long after the debates have ended and the developers have moved on.

The question isn’t whether Ethereum can remain agile—it’s whether it has the courage to stop. To become boring. To die beautifully, so that the world it supports can thrive.

This isn’t just a technical argument. It’s a call to the soul of the community. Can we let go of what we’ve built so that it can live beyond us? Can we embrace the death of the Ethereum we know, to give birth to the Ethereum the world needs?",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Reddit,ethereum,"Controlling the fee on Ethereum (Metamask, nodes and Etherscan) is just a nightmare - Is this a bug?",2024-11-22 08:39:51,"I'm not happy with how this went, but I wouldn't call this a rant. Let's call it a description of the nightmare that even someone as techy as a blockchain engineer had to go through to control the fee of their transaction. I see all these posts on Twitter about ""improving the user experience""... and Ethereum ecosystem can't get submitting transactions right... are you kidding me?

**It feels like in Metamask, it's made to be difficult so that people get frustrated and use the highest fee possible.** Tell me I'm crazy and this isn't your experience. Tell me I'm wrong. I'm all for learning how to do everything right.

What happened?

I wanted to sign (and submit) a transaction on metamask with a hardware wallet (HW). It's a smart contract transaction (and a big one, so the execution fee is unusually high), so I wanted to minimize the fee. Metamask was suggesting something like 45 gwei, which is very expensive and I'm not in a hurry. In blockchain (whether it's bitcoin, monero or otherwise), we're supposed to have the freedom to submit our transactions with low fees, and when the network is less congested it will go through. Right... RIGHT?

So, I whip out my HW  (which is a hassle, and I don't want to do it many times), I sign the transaction with 8 gwei, and submit it. 

To my surprise, not only the transaction failed, but the nonce is not incrememnted (not a smart contract transaction failure, as I see on the block explorer), AND METAMASK HAS NO OPTION TO REBROADCAST THE TRANSACTION, even though it's NOT invalid!!!!

I thought, OK, maybe this is a glitch. I'll do it again. I redo the signing with my HW. And it failed again, and again, and again. At that point, I realized that this is just Metamask trying to make my life hell. There's no option to rebroadcast, and it WANTS TO FORCE ME TO USE A HIGH FEE, so EVERY TIME I WANT TO SUBMIT THE SAME FREAKING TRANSACTION, I HAVE TO SIGN IT AGAIN????? Wtf is that supposed to be?

And here's what's even worse: There's no way to extract the signed transaction as a hex string, so that I can submit it later elsewhere... how dare I want to pay less fees? I must be crazy!

So, I was done with this shit and now I'm just stubborn. I opened the developer tools in the browser, tracked the function that submits transactions in Metamask, and pulled the transaction hex from the belly of that fox. Done. Now I have the signed transaction hex. 

Here's where Metamask problems end, and Etherscan problems begin.

I go to pushTx on Etherscan to submit the transaction, submit it, track it on Etherscan, and sleep on it.

Today in the morning, I wake up, I try to check the transaction, it hasn't gone through (it's not in a block yet), EVEN THOUGH THE SUGGESTED FEE NOW IS LOWER THAN THE FEE I USED FOR THE TRANSACTION. Etherscan still says that my transaction didn't go through. So what's wrong? 

If I have to guess what happened, I think all stakers/miners dropped my transaction from their mempools. Fine, I understand (even though this is hostile to user experience since all this is within 12 hours). So, I try to submit my transaction again using the hex I collected yesterday, but Etherscan complains that the transaction is ""already known""... wtf is that???? I immediately recognize that this is ANOTHER BUG... Etherscan has the transaction in its cache, but it's not in the mempool!

I go to another website that offers transaction hex submission, I submitted, and my transaction went through in 1 minute. NIGHTMARE IS F**KING OVER!

Conclusion: WTF was that? Am I the only one in the world who controls their fees?

**Edit:** Serious conclusion: If you're not a tech nerd like me, there's no way to defer submitting a transaction with low fee to a later time. You can only just keep signing the same transaction again and again when the fee you want is viable, or increase the fee. Horrible for usability.

**Edit 2:** Imagine being so tribal that you downvote such a detailed post from a blockchain expert explaining a real problem in Ethereum ecosystem. And the Ethereum community wonders why people complain about usability. If you cared, this post would get 1 million upvotes.

Reddit,ethereum,Why nearly everyone misunderstands rollups. How it's possible to have both an optimistic bridge and zk bridge on a single rollup.,2024-11-21 23:40:26,"One of the most interesting panels at Devcon this month was **""[This is how rollups really work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k)"" by Kelvin Fichter** from Optimism, who says that most people in the crypto community have an incorrect understanding for what is a rollup.

This is actually a fairly deep concept, and there are even parts I still don't fully understand.

####**Most of us have an incorrect concept of what a rollup is**

Fichter brings up the idea that the concept of an ""optimistic rollup"" or ""zk rollup"" doesn't actually exist because ""classical rollups"" (i.e. smart contract rollups) are not purely defined by their smart contract bridges. Classical rollups can actually have multiple bridges, and they aren't necessarily fixed to one L1<>L2 bridge.

**The precise definition of a rollup he prefers is**:

> A blockchain that uses another blockchain for ordering and data availability.

In other words:

* Compressed data is completely stored on L1 (or in blobs)
* L1 ultimately provides ordering for the transactions in the rollup data
* For classical rollups, L1 also provides consensus for rollups through a trust-minimized bridge. For sovereign rollups, L2 nodes provide consensus.

And that's it. It does not necessarily need to have a bridge with optimistic proofs or zk proofs. And sovereign rollups do not even use the base layer for consensus.

This isn't the first time this idea has been brought up. Several other notable discussions:

* Jon Charbonneau - https://dba.mirror.xyz/LYUb_Y2huJhNUw_z8ltqui2d6KY8Fc3t_cnSE9rDL_o (an excellent summary)
* Kelvin Fichter - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlxSP_ABE4Y
* Toghrul Maharramov - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k

####**What would happen if a rollup had more than 1 bridge (optimistic + zk)?**

The vast majority of rollups we're familiar with (e.g. Optimism, Arbitrum One, Base, Linea) have exactly 1 enshrined bridge. We typically call them ""optimistic rollups"" or ""zk rollups"" as **a simplification of the definitions** because their main smart contract bridge back to L1 with the vast majority of TVL uses either optimistic proofs or zk proofs. If that single L1<>L2 bridge were compromised, the whole network would practically be compromised. So for simplicity, we assign the value of the rollup to that single bridge.

But technically, someone else could build a zk bridge on an ""optimistic rollup"" to store sequenced transaction data on L1. And if over time, 99% of the TVL transfers from the optimistic bridge over to the zk bridge, it would shift from being an optimistic rollup to a hybrid rollup and then to a zk rollup.

While I can't think of any rollup that currently has multiple types of bridges, the concept isn't new.

For example, the **Polygon PoS network** was originally a Plasma chain because it had a [Plasma bridge] (https://polygonscan.com/txnbridge) (that's still active). Later on, it shifted to a smart contract bridge, which ended up with nearly all the TVL activity. There are 2 main bridges on the same network, so Polygon PoS is more than just a Plasma chain or a Side chain. It's a network with 2 bridges of different types.

Overall, I think it's still fine to refer rollups as an ""optimistic rollup"" or a ""zk rollup"" as a simplification, but it's important to understand how rollups really works and why those terms are technically misleading.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Reddit,ethereum,I just got banned from /Bitcoin for “shilling” ETH,2024-11-22 22:18:08,"I just got banned from r/Bitcoin for “shilling” ETH. Such emotional and uneducated boomer mods over there. 

All I said was that ETH has more utility than BTC which is undeniably true.

I support both BTC and ETH but this toxicity between both “sides” is what is preventing new investors from pouring in. 

When half of what they hear is that BTC is a scam and it has no utility, and the other half is that ETH is a scam with pre-mined coins and unlimited inflation, I can see why potential “outsiders” are skeptical with the entire industry. 

This bickering needs to stop between BTC and ETH communities. Lots of legit scams out there in the crypto industry, but using “scam” to describe the two most legit cryptos in the industry is pulling us back from true mass adoption. 

I think BTC is the superior store of value. That doesn’t mean ETH doesn’t have potential to be the future of DeFi.

Reddit,ethereum,How to get Ethereum from my early 2016 Ethereum Wallet,2024-11-21 16:42:23,"In Feb 2016 I mined less than 1 Ethereum (says 0.70 probably closer to 0.69).  I can see the funds on Ethereum-Wallet-win64-0-3-9, which is also from Feb 2016.  I just ignored this for years as I didn't need the money but I do now.

I tried to send a very small amount to a Coinbase account I made.  Coinbase gives me the same address for receiving ETH from either ""Ethereum"" or ""Base"" Networks, so that's the address I used.  I tried a small amount to test (0.001) and it's at 0 of 12 confirmations for several hours now - so it did not work.  The first gas fees I tried were too low, but it did accept a higher gas fee and I had to input my password so means it's talking to the network to some extent right?

Under my 2016 Ethereum Wallet application, there is a ""Wallet Contracts"" section and an option to ""Add Wallet Contract"" and I don't have anything there.  But I'm wary to try to do much more with this nearly 9 years old Application.  When I click ""Etherbase"" with the key symbol it says ""Accounts can't display incoming transactions, but hold and send ether."" So I should be able to send from here, right?

I downloaded Ethereum Wallet and Mist Beta 0.11.1 - windows hotfix from Github today.  But it doesn't work on my PC.  ""Checksum mismatch in downloaded node!"" with an MD5 listed and then ""Please install the Geth node version 1.8.23 manually"".  Maybe because I have an older version?

How can I get this Ethereum to my Coinbase account?",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

There are millions of ~~bots~~ people whose whole crypto experience is limited to Solana. I can easily imagine that many people's crypto experience could be limited to Base, especially since many successful L2 projects are copied on Base. So, from the user's POV, they have access to +/- the same dapps.

Of course, it's something that we don't want in the long run, as we want L2 diversity for security and innovation reasons. But I don't think that lack of interop is such a big barrier to growth as of November 2024.

Reddit,ethereum,Next Devcon location?,2024-11-20 13:10:17,"**Devcon 2024 was an absolute blast!**

Over 12K dedicated to Ethereum enthusiasts came together, creating an unforgettable atmosphere.

Incredible to see how Devcon continues to grow and evolve into a larger-scale event each year.

Over the years, Devcon has been hosted in incredible locations across the globe, including Germany, the UK, China, Mexico, the Czech Republic, Japan, Colombia, and Thailand.

https://preview.redd.it/07756dii122e1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef2a7ee05979513c51729541940a9b21b8dcc90a

So, the big question is: **Where will the next Devcon be held?** 👇

**My bet is Africa!**

* Devcon has touched almost every continent, and Africa feels like the natural next step to expand Ethereum’s reach.
* Africa has hosted countless blockchain courses, hackathons, and conferences in recent years, demonstrating a deep and growing interest in blockchain technologies. 
* Vitalik Buterin has visited Africa multiple times, championing blockchain innovation across the continent. In Zambia, a dynamic group of young entrepreneurs is working diligently with Vitalik’s support to position the country as a burgeoning technology hub in Africa. Furthermore, Ethereum developers are actively engaged in raising awareness and fostering growth within the African blockchain community.

The most compelling reason for my prediction lies in the burgeoning interest in Ethereum and blockchain technology among the African community. The enthusiasm for Ethereum and blockchain tech in Africa is unmatched.

At Devcon, there was an interesting talk by David Uzochukwu from Node Bridge Africa, who discussed the challenges and opportunities of running Ethereum nodes in Africa. He shared about overcoming infrastructure limitations, leveraging community support, the potential economic empowerment through staking, and fostering local adoption and innovation.

🔗 [youtube.com/watch?v=\_AywwOgu2zY](http://youtube.com/watch?v=_AywwOgu2zY)

With this growing interest and activity, I believe we’ll see a significant shift in ETH’s global node distribution, and Africa will soon have a notable presence.

So, that's my guess!

**Cape Town, Zambia, Zanzibar, or any other African city may be our next Devcon destination.**

Reddit,ethereum,How To Open Encrypted JSON Key Files,2024-11-19 15:11:44,"I see a ton of questions about how to open encrypted json keyfiles, so I thought I would just put this here. I am going to do this the ""old school"" way and show you how to open these files using tools built by Ethereum foundation themselves. This means you do not have to trust me or anyone in any way other than the people who actually built Ethereum. This is the safest way to open these files. Once you do this set of operations, you will get the private key itself that you can drop into whatever wallet you want.

First, you need to have GoLang ( a programming language ) installed. In order to install GoLang go to this website:  
[https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Follow the directions there and you will now have GoLang working on your machine. This is the programming language the Geth Ethereum node software is written in.

Next you need to download the Geth github repo. This is the actual Go-Ethereum node software that lets you run an Ethereum node, but we are not going to run the node itself. Instead we are going to run a tool that is part of the git repo, so you need to download the whole repo. You can do this by going here:  
[https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

https://preview.redd.it/ny1h8s41fv1e1.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f96c788e3e24a3f2c54af4324ae4f52938addb

Once you go there click on the Green Button that says ""Code"", then click on ""HTTPS"" and then click download zip.

Once you have downloaded the zip file, you can unzip it.

Now open a terminal and navigate to the \`/cmd\` directory from the unzipped source code. The sub directories should look something like this:  


https://preview.redd.it/qcgterzhfv1e1.png?width=1339&format=png&auto=webp&s=779e7404920c6caf8bba03db0174fb30f08a2733

What we want it the \`ethkey\` sub directory. So navigate there in your terminal.

Once there you can type the following to build the program and run it in the local directory:  
\`go run .\`

You should now see the help page for the utility and it should look something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/u5dun6h5iv1e1.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c2fc97bd96dc948aeb06213ebed6b065b66312f

Now copy your keyfile into the same directory as \`/cmd/ethkey\` and type in the following:

\`go run . inspect --private keyfile.json\`

Make sure you make the \`keyfile.json\` part of the command is the name of your keyfile. This will generate an output like this ( this is a burner account so don't bother trying to go dump it ):

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,"It’s Going Down, I’m Selling Everything!",2024-11-26 08:21:32,"Before you hit the sell button, take a deep breath. Market volatility can be overwhelming, but it’s important to zoom out and focus on the bigger picture. Here are some key reasons why holding Bitcoin for the long term might be a better strategy than panic-selling during dips:

1. Volatility Is Normal

Bitcoin has always been volatile. There have been multiple corrections of 50% or more in its history, yet it has managed to recover and reach new all-time highs. Dips are part of the game; they don’t define the long-term trajectory.

2. Time in the Market Beats Timing the Market

Trying to perfectly time the market is nearly impossible. Historically, those who simply held onto their Bitcoin through the ups and downs have outperformed traders who panic-sell or try to time their re-entries.

3. Adoption Is Growing

Every year, Bitcoin gains more adoption from institutions, governments, and individuals. This trend suggests a bright future, even if the current price action looks grim.

4. Bitcoin Is Scarce

With a fixed supply of 21 million, Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary. As demand grows, the limited supply could make Bitcoin more valuable over time.

5. Zoom Out

Look at Bitcoin’s performance over the last decade. Despite crashes, bear markets, and fear, Bitcoin has consistently grown in value for those who held long-term. Short-term movements are just noise.

6. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

If you’re nervous about buying during volatile times, DCA is a great strategy. It lets you buy small amounts over time, reducing the impact of market swings and emotional decisions.

7. Avoid Emotional Decisions

Markets thrive on fear and greed. Selling in panic locks in losses, while holding or accumulating during tough times allows you to benefit when the market rebounds.

Final Thought:
Bitcoin isn’t just an investment—it’s a revolution in financial systems. Selling during a dip means you’re letting fear dictate your decisions. Instead, focus on the fundamentals, keep a long-term perspective, and remember why you got into Bitcoin in the first place.

By the 2020 cycle, as Bitcoin gained institutional adoption and deeper liquidity, corrections averaged 20-30%, signaling diminishing volatility with scale. 

In 2024, Bitcoin is even more mature, with trillions in market cap and strategic buyers like Michael Saylor executing $5.3 billion in purchases, creating a powerful price floor. 

With reduced sell-side liquidity and increased demand, this cycle’s corrections could shrink further to 5-10%, that's why I am putting my money where my mouth is.

Reddit,bitcoin,Could Pokemon GTS (Global Trading System) have been the inspiration for Bitcoin?,2024-11-26 04:31:03,"Just as a thought experiment- could Pokemon's Diamond and Pearl Global Trading System (GTS) have been the inspiration for Bitcoin? There are some really interesting connections between the way Pokemon GTS works and Bitcoin.

Pokemon Diamond and Pearl released late 2006 in Japan and early 2007 in Europe and North America. It is speculated that the development of Bitcoin code began in mid-late 2007. Bitcoin. org was registered as a domain in 2008.

GTS in Pokemon was a decentralized exchange for players to trade Pokémon with anyone around the world without direct interaction. The only way to trade Pokemon before this was link cables.

Then of course the obvious Satoshi pseudonym as the nod to the original Ash and creator of Pokemon (Satoshi Tajiri).

I think it's way more fun to think that Bitcoin was started off of the idea of a global Pokémon trade. I like to imagine whoever Satoshi was / is / are as sitting around playing Pokemon and trading for a Chimchar with different people around the world... then imagining this trustless exchange could work for money too! Last thing I'll say is one of the only ways to get a Dialga was to trade for it!",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918
Reddit,bitcoin,How I Changed My Mind About Bitcoin,2024-11-26 07:32:24,"I’ve always had an interest in crypto and even wrote a master’s thesis on blockchain and DLT. But, coming from a country with strict financial regulations, I wasn’t sure if Bitcoin could ever reach widespread adoption—especially with organizations like the European Central Bank (ECB) being cautious about it.

Then something happened that made me rethink everything.

While running my business, I occasionally worked with someone who happened to be employed at the EIB (European Investment Bank). Over lunch one day, they mentioned their personal view on Bitcoin, saying it had a lot of potential and could be the best long-term investment. (To be clear, this was their own opinion—not an official statement or anything.)

Hearing that perspective from someone working inside the system really made me reconsider. Shortly after, I decided to start shifting some of my portfolio from traditional ETFs like QQQ and SPY into BTC.

It’s funny how a single conversation can change your perspective... BTC to the moon!",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918
Reddit,bitcoin,2013 Lost 1.3 BTC,2024-11-26 10:48:26,"A couple of weeks ago, my friend informed me that in 2013 he bought ~1.3 BTC when it was way cheaper. He looked for it a few years ago but not deeply. 

I told him I would help him look for it and he offered me a substantial amount if I can recover the lost bitcoin. 

A week later I found out he has an old hotmail address that he thinks he knows the password for that the bitcoin is on. He can’t access the account, though hasn’t tried overly hard. 

How would people go about trying to recover the Bitcoin? I have verified the email exists, I have been awaiting a response, but am persuading him to use the microsoft hotmail recovery service though he says he has used it, but I don’t think he has exhausted all the possibilities in that. If it was me I wouldn’t have stopped trying to get the email back since I remembered. Then if failing, contacting all the likely wallets it could be contained in manually. 

Thank you so much, this is a life changing amount of money!! Please let me know of any other systems or services or ideas you would have to recover the Bitcoin. Cheers. ",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918
Reddit,bitcoin,"Bitcoin is Indestructible, Immutable, and Aligns Incentives.",2024-11-26 00:49:07,"The Bitcoin network is a decentralized financial institution. No one person is in charge of it. It is a computer program currently running on around 20,000 computers worldwide, called ""nodes."" Some of these nodes are located in underground bunkers, while others are said to be orbiting the Earth on satellites. As long as a node survives, the network survives. For this reason, the Bitcoin network is nearly indestructible. Each node has the same ledger, making fraud impossible. All transactions are confirmed by these networks. In my opinion, banks are scared of this technology for that very reason. The ledger contains every Bitcoin transaction ever made. You can download the entire ledger to your computer for free and be the next person to run the Bitcoin network. Its current size is nearly 600 gigabytes. We live in a world where you can download a program to your computer and be your own bank. If Bank of America or Wells Fargo were to shit the bed, wouldn't you rather have your savings on an indestructible global ledger?

Reddit,bitcoin,Life Insurance with Bitcoin,2024-11-26 07:15:08,"Hey everybody!

I'd like to ensure that somebody I know is guaranteed to get a part of my Bitcoin in the case of me dying. Of course I could write this into my last will (and I probably will), however a solution that is directly implemented onto the Blockchain seems much more elegant to me. Does such a solution maybe already exist?

If not, I thought about a Bitcoin Script that is a multisig of two addresses, only one address is needed to sign, but the second address only becomes available at a specific block height. That way I could always renew the transaction while still breathing to some block height that is still in the future (maybe always a year or two), renewing it every 6 months. The obvious downside of this approach is that if I ever get into a situation where I can't renew (e.g. fall into a coma), that the bitcoin could then be spent early by the second address. A downside that is completely acceptable to me.

I have never written a bitcoin script before, but I think something along the lines of this should work:

    <pubkey1> OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_IF
      OP_TRUE
    OP_ELSE
      <block_height> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
      <pubkey2> OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ENDIF

Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline, dropping below the critical $93,000 mark. This has raised one major question among investors: Is this a golden buying opportunity or a sign of further downward pressure?

Here’s a quick analysis:
	1.	Key Support Level:
	•	The $92,000 zone is a strong psychological and technical support level. Breaking below this could open doors to further bearish momentum.
	•	However, if BTC holds above this level, it might signal a potential rebound.
	2.	Market Indicators:
	•	RSI: Currently approaching oversold territory, suggesting a possible bounce.
	•	Moving Averages (MA): Short-term MAs signal bearishness, but long-term MAs still indicate a bullish trend in play.
	•	Volume Analysis: Increasing sell volume indicates short-term panic selling, but could also signal capitulation.
	3.	Sentiment Check:
	•	Fear is dominating the market right now. Historically, such conditions have been followed by strong rallies.

What do you think?
	•	Are we about to see a major rebound, or is it time to sit on the sidelines?

Two things happened in the fall of 2017: first the service I was using, Coinbase, inexplicably said all Canadians had to find a new wallet / exchange and gave very little notice.  I scrambled and searched up the largest / best service operating in Canada at the time and moved my stash over.  

The second thing that happened was Jamie Dimon came out with his infamous “fraud” comments.  I was and remain a fan of his.  I was sitting on a nice six-bagger so I liquidated my coins and proceeded to try to cash out. 

Well in my scramble to find a new service that worked in Canada I had found myself at QuadrigaCX.  I’ll cut it short but in the end in fact I did get my proceeds but only because I was VERY persistent over a number of weeks. I believe I was corresponding with Gerald Cotton himself in the emails as later it turned out he did basically everything there and if I recall correctly there were basically no other employees.  To this day I believe the only reason I got my money back was because I inundated the guy with messages and became the squeakiest wheel. 

Finally, yes I understand that my stash would today be worth about $750,000 USD. But if I’d have HEDL I’m sure my dude would have taken my stash to India where he seems to have met his demise.   I don’t think people got much if any out after Quadriga blew up.

Hi r/CryptoCurrency! My book, “[Number Go Up](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/711959/number-go-up-by-zeke-faux/),” is a globe-spanning investigation of crypto, from its beginnings to the 2022 crash to its comeback. This is me, [Zeke Faux](https://x.com/ZekeFaux/status/1860329843843358744). ([proof](https://x.com/ZekeFaux/status/1860329843843358744)) I talked my way onto billionaire’s yachts, went all the way to Cambodia to track down a “pig butchering” scheme, and was with Sam Bankman-Fried at his $30 million penthouse in the Bahamas just before his arrest. The book was used as [evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/business/dealbook/bankman-fried-defense-trial.html) at SBF’s trial. I also paid $20,000 for a [Mutant Ape ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THdU00jutvo)to get into a party thrown by the Bored Ape Yacht Club :( (I named him Dr. Scum)

Ask me anything--

\*Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial

\*Tether–the $100 billion stablecoin at the center of crypto and the people behind it

\*[Pig butchering ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-08-17/my-crypto-hell-journey-started-with-a-wrong-number-scam-text)schemes – the scams and human trafficking behind those wrong number text messages we all get

\*NFTs, Play to earn games, and the Axie Infinity craze in the Philippines

\*Celsius-I also spent time with its founder Alex Mashinsky for the book. His criminal trial is coming up next year

\*Donald Trump’s newfound love for crypto and the project he’s promoting, [World Liberty](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-13/behind-the-trump-crypto-project-is-a-self-described-dirtbag-of-the-internet?sref=sGNHChN7) Financial

\*crypto regulation under Trump and the possibility of strategic Bitcoin reserve

\*Investigative reporting techniques

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,You're about to be scammed. A lot. ,2024-11-25 22:51:53,"You're new to the crypto game...regret not getting in earlier because blah blah blah.

Listen...you're going to see a lot of things that promise you lots of money. But trust me when I say this..you won't make a lot unless you get lucky. You won't make millions or tens of thousands. Most of us have been slowly buying over the last 4+ years. We've seen bad days and we've seen worse days...

Set your expectations to smaller gains, especially if you've jumped on this in the past month or 2.

DO NOT connect your wallet to anything. If you do, make sure your wallet is empty. Never ever ever connect your main wallet to anything. Most of us have multiple wallets for the same coin for this reason (that and a bit more privacy). 

There are a lot of rug pull coins, we're seeing it happen...this has happened before, just Google squid game coin (which for some dumb fucking reason, people are rebuying into FFS).

Please please please be careful. If you do get scammed or rug pulled people may say you deserve it, but that's a shitty thing to say especially as a lot of us want crypto to have massive adoption. This just puts more people off and sets a really negative stigma on what crypto is and can be. 

Do your research, don't just follow some YouTube cunt who wants to make gains off of your investments. Their only interests are their pockets (the more people buy and invest the more the coin they're shilling goes up), they don't care about you. 

Also, invest in what you're comfortable with losing. 
And remember, what goes up...must come down (if you're down 10%...gaining 10% wont get you back to where you were...) 

If you have other advice to give or ranting posts on what to watch out for, please do. I joined this subreddit to learn more about crypto and not just shill a coin...

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why would MicroStrategy purchase additional 50% of their BTC holding at the peak? Are they leveraging / borrowing?,2024-11-25 23:15:48,"So as most of us know, since 2020 MicroStrategy were consistently purchasing BTC and according to this website, they have held 252,220 BTC before November 2024. Until now, this seemed like very smart and wise DCA however what they have done this month is questionable.

In this month, November 2024 they have purchased 134,480 BTC which was over 50% of their entire holding of BTC as of the end of October 2024. Further they have paid for it over 10B which is more than they have paid for the 252,220 BTC that they have been acquiring over last 4 years or so.

Unless they are leveraging the gains of previously acquired BTC to get more BTC, their purchases from November 2024 or doing this to get publicity - this does not make sense to me. Why would they spend 100% of what they have been spending at ATH of BTC to get roughly 50% BTC when they believed in BTC all this time.

",2024-11-25 17:06:54,"I never understood these anti-crypto narratives, and they seem just as contradictory, as they seem a little out of touch.

They say it's too expensive, too hard, and to slow to use for transactions.

Yet, here I was last week ordering another batch of porn online, and in just 4 clicks using my XLM that went through in about a second, with a $0.00005 fee. And they gave me a little discount for not using a credit card, which was more money back than a credit card's cashback.

There's many cryptos that do cheap and fast transactions now. I think SOL still being the fastest, and NANO being completely free.

And then, in the next sentence they'll tell you it's a currency that criminals love to use.

They'll say it's too easy for criminals to use crypto now, it doesn't cost them much, and they can quickly get a drug deal executed, or transfer money around the world without having any bank or government in between that can stop the transaction.

And the person on the other side can be sure they got paid with the money in their hands, because it's a direct P2P payment, without any switcheroo, block, or reversed transaction.

And they would be right about that.

But while criminals can easily move money without that money being stopped, if they use a chain like Bitcoin, it can still somewhat be tracked. Especially if they're not smart about it.

It's still a transparent ledger, so while they can't stop the transaction, and the person on the other side will definitely get their money, the government can see it (if they know what to look for in the first place), and potentially track it if there is some sort of known in the equation.

**Conclusion:**

Yes, crypto has become increasingly easier to use, has been getting cheaper and faster, that it's become a nice tool for everyone, including criminals, to transfer money around the world in a more direct and more pseudo-anonymous way, without any bank or institution in between.

But many of these chains are still transparent, so criminals aren't gonna be immune from being tracked by governments that have enough advanced tools and can subpoena exchanges and businesses to divulge the key information to figure out what transaction might belong to them.

It can still be somewhat useful to criminals in some cases, and makes their transaction direct and untouchable, but doesn't always make the criminals themselves untouchable or untraceable.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

**Do:** 

* **get back your initial investment**

**Do not:** 

* **Hodl everything for even more future profits** 
* **Double Down and buy more** 

**Seriously if this post trends check the comments of this post and I guarantee people will tell you how they bought an alt in 2021 held for huge gains and then held back down for a significant loss.**

You call upon this AI agent by @ him, and ask him to create a token. You need to give the name, ticker, and optionally a picture to be used. That's LITERALLY all it takes. 



the bot then creates:

* token on the Base network,
* dexscreener page ,
* uniswap listing and LP (1% pair).



All of it from a single cast. 

Naturally, people went nuts over it. First one was Clanker token itself (ordered to be created by the dev team of the AI agent). One user instructed another AI agent to give the commend to this AI agent to create a token (LUM). It exploded to 45M mcap. Another account said to Clanker to create a token, and if you own a certain amount of this token, you can cast anonymously under the account Superanon. Thing snowballed pretty quickly. In two weeks, over 3k tokens have been created. Also, let's say you make a token with clanker. You as a requestor get a certain amount of fees the LP creates. 

No, it's not a scam. No, it's not a honey pot, the contract ensures anyone and everyone can sell. No, it's not a copy of pumpfun or wow, as the tokens are immediately listed on Uni with a V3 pair (there is no bonding, maturing or whatnot). No, you don't need to put any funds into it (creation of a token is absolutely free). Yes, there are sniper bots currently, buying seconds after the tokens are created (it is being solved, but be warned).

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,We're still early. ,2024-11-24 21:21:59,"I like to use credit cards as a comparison. What would later become Visa was first launched in 1958 by Bank of America. It was initially known as the [BankAmericard credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.#:~:text=Visa%20was%20founded%20in%201958,other%20financial%20institutions%20in%201966) program. Fast forward a couple decades, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRwJw3Bdavs) to see how people reacted to Burger King's news that it would accept credit cards at all locations in 1993. The tenor? Skepticism. Adoption takes time. People adjusting to new systems, vocabulary, and behavior takes time. We're still early.

However, don't be stupid. Make a plan. Here's my plan: I'm selling a third of all my holdings once the total market cap of all coins hits 4 trillion dollars. I'll sell another third of all my holdings once the total market market cap hits 7 trillion dollars. Most of my portfolio is in BTC. The majority of my other holdings are the big L1 smart contract platforms that can handle volume. I don't know which will win so I own several of them. I figure that if 1 to 3 win in the bag, then it'll pay for the losses of the rest. If crypto falls below 2 trillion total market cap, then I'll resume DCA in my portfolio. At current prices I'm not buying anything.

That's my plan. I'm not saying that it's the best plan, but it's what I'm doing. Yes we're early. But make a plan so that you're not second guessing yourself everyday as prices shift around.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Do you want to leave this cycle in profit or not?,2024-11-26 09:12:20,"You’re not gonna make bank following influencer picks or buying some 12 year old TikToker’s bags at the pico top. If you’re doing that, you’re LATE to the party. That’s a fact you should internalize, alright?

Now listen up… BTC is about to break $100k real soon, and when it does, the media machine is gonna crank up the hype for retail. When retail rolls in, they’ll see BTC as way too pricey and honestly, they’re not wrong.

So, what’s next? They scroll down the CMC list and start looking for tokens that “make sense.” These usually fall into three categories: AI (because of the hype), gaming, and memes. And let’s be real, gaming and memes are waaay easier for them to wrap their heads around.

Need proof? Look at the dino gaming coins like GALA and SAND. They’ve been popping off this past week. Nobody on CT is seriously bidding them outside of quick scalps. And what about DOGE and PEPE? They’ve run hard too.

Alright, so here’s the play: the biggest runners might come from gaming and meme sectors. And what meta hasn’t popped off yet? Gaming memecoins.

I’m just saying. This is your shot to actually beat the herd. Position yourself early in a fresh meta that hasn’t fully caught on yet. It means going against the n00bs who have ADHD and religiously follow every green candle out there.

Take what you’ve learned from Murad about strong communities, delusional valuation beliefs, and unique vibes. Calmly analyze the market. Find those gaming memecoin gems that are poised to run hard.

Congrats. You’re now two steps ahead of the herd.

BUY THE RED BUT STRONG CHARTS AND SELL THE FINAL META.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Mining coins for free,2024-11-26 08:27:59,"Hey guys!

I just wanted to share with you a way to mine coins for free that I recently discovered.

I’m talking about the Human App, where anyone can launch their own personal coin. Users can buy coins or mine them for free by tapping on them.

# What is the exact profit of mining coins in the Human App?

According to the information from the app, the following applies:

1. The total supply of every token is 1,000,000,000.
2. The market cap of each token is 97 SOL.
3. 12.5% of the supply will be distributed to all token tappers, which means they will distribute around 12 SOL.
4. Each coin's owner is allocated 10% of the total supply.

If you've tapped, for example, 10% of the coin, you will earn 1.2 SOL.  
Additionally, if you are the coin's owner, you will receive an extra 1.2 SOL.

Not bad, considering you don’t need to pay anything for it.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

I found it again recently and plugged it in to my computer. There was a few hours worth of updates but when it opened, I realized my initial investment was over 40x in value.

So what am I supposed to do about taxes? I haven't cashed out anything but according to Canadian taxes from what I understand is that In supposed to file taxes on any increase in value each year? So I was supposed to be paying taxes? What if it increases in value and you pay taxes on a large amount then it drops the next year? Then you've essentially paid taxes on something that doesn't exist.

Always)** ***^(read between the lines)*** **^(and always)** ***^(do your own research)*****^(.)**

  


# Start

The year is 2024, you are seeing bitcoin and crypto coming into your timeline more and more. USA just elected a president who is pro crypto. Elon Musk is jumping up and down on Trump rally and he's also pro crypto. You are wondering ""is this just internet magic money? Is this a ponzi scheme? Why the heck would I use a currency , fiat already exists. There are no additional use cases""



# The Ideology

^(You can ignore this part if you are already tired of reading similar summary over and over again. Remember this is MY opinion and does not reflect everyone's opinion. This part also has a lot of compiled conspiracy theory and not my own.)

1912, Titanic just sank and took down old banking system. The Rothschild bankers and few others who happened to be off the boat, has now gripped the world financial system. Federal Reserve which can indefinitely print money supply in exchange for gold was established in 1913. WW1 and WW2 followed shortly which introduced massive amounts of temporary tax (we still are in that temporary taxation system). Till 1970, we had this certificate (now fiat money) , that was printed and backed by Gold, oil and few other global commodities. The more commodity a country had, the more value it's printed certificate (dollar, rupee etc.) had. Gold and oil was the ""native liquidity currency"". Remember this: ""native liquidity currency"". USA being the new super leader, decided to hoard as much gold and oil possible by dealing with as many countries as possible. US dollar or any other fiat currency had this pair ($ Country's money / Gold)

1971, USA has a significant amount of gold, and oil, and a grip on the world. USSR (now Russia) was and still is it's arch rival. By now, USA has already made a few great decision for itself by establishing itself as a world native liquidity currency. ***USA decided to depeg the gold from it's native liquidity.*** 

Which means before it was ***($ USD / Gold ) but now it's ($ USD / \_\_\_\_)***. Where as the rest of the world was ($ Rupee / USD), ($Yen / USD). Trades were and still happens in USD, even now. If you want to send a shipment of paint from China to Bangladesh, it's done in USD. Not yen, not taka.  

**Now the question is, if my country's currency has a US dollar reserve and USD is being treated as one of the major liquidity currency, what about USD? What is USD's own native liquidity pair?  :)**   
**I will leave the history of 1971-2000s fill out your imagination.** 

  
From the 1900 - 2000, the old banking system has significantly shifted from being Gold backed to US dollar backed. USA is also printing as much as it wants out of thin air with nothing but war behind it's liquidity backing. Any country that is trying to get back to gold or oil standard has been uprooted. So paper money is literally being made from trees. 

***Fiat currency supply keeps going up, value keeps going down. If USA prints, your country's currency is gaining strength but that all depends on whether they are NOT printing themselves. This macro economics majorly affects us and crypto every single day. The key for your country is to stop printing while USA prints.*** 

  
Your parents have immediately felt the affects of this depegging over 1970s - 2000s. Everything inflated fast. Their salary was not that far off of inflated value of homes, cars, food. Taxes were not that bad, it was supposed to be temporary but it was acceptable. 

You were born in the 80s - 2000s, now you are either in your 20s or your 40s. You are in this subreddit trying to figure out how do you get rich via crypto and how to get out of this rut. Where's this get rich quick scheme?

  
2009 - Satoshi (a person or group of people or psyop by the banking system), invented BTC Bitcoin. Digital currency that can't be printed. The idea that one day it will become a native liquidity currency like gold or oil. Unhackable because you'd have to hack all the mining computers all at once. Mining means you use your computer to act as part of the ledger system that keeps transactions all in sync and calculated while solving a formula to SLOWLY mine 21 million bitcoin (total). All of a sudden you can send money overseas without any issues, albeit transaction fee is expensive af. However, this is the only thing banks and feds cannot touch or tax(However, we all know decentralized - they cannot, centralized - they can, we will dive in to this later). You can hold on to it and battle this unlimited printing of fiat. You know rest of the usual story that people say so we won't be diving more into this. 



# Deep dive into Defi

Decentralized is a word that gets thrown around every where. Everyone claims to be decentralized in crypto and btc subforums. However, 90% of the people are just buying and holding in CEX (centralized exchanges like binance). They are then selling it for USDT for profit or loss, and sending it back to their banks for fiat. They were never decentralized. They don't use bitcoin for anything. They don't use ethereum for anything. They don't use solana for anything. 

  
So what can you use these coins for? Is it just for silk road like the early bitcoin days? I pay someone in btc and someone gives me the limited edition pokemon card on ebay?  Sure, but no.

  
DeFi truly started during introduction of Ethereum by an alpha centauri alien called Vitalik. It didn't have a max supply like bitcoin, it was exactly like fiat in the sense that you can print it. However, printing was not controlled by the ETH foundation, it was printed by miners. You had to mine it. Why would we buy eth if it's still being printed? 

  
ETH had 3 tricks up it's sleeve. 

1. dApps (decentralized apps - it's what apps are to smart phones - whaaaat?)
2. Layer 2 EVMs (make your own network - wow!)
3. tokens (its like a coin, you can attach a name to)

>  
If Bitcoin is gold , Ethereum is silver. Gold is a store of value, where silver is a tool

  
**2018 - The birth of Uniswap:**

dApp builders like myself started scrambling and figuring out what to make. What can we all make in this brand new finance world? 

One of the first key things that came out was Uniswap. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. Anyone can make a token and upload it with eth as it's native liquidity pair (token/ETH). In return Uniswap gave that user a liquidity pool token which is like a key that you can use to unlock the pair and pull out the money if they wanted. 

No more applying to CEX like binance for listing your own project, no more accredited investor status required for buying and selling things, no tax (controversial), and definitely cannot be frozen by banks. 

You can buy and sell any token that you want, you can make your own token (if you knew how to code in ethereum smart contract language called solidity), and you can make your token tradeable via uniswap. All you had to do was go on subforums and talk about your own tokens. What you needed was a wallet like metamask with actual ETH (not in CEX), you needed to press wallet connect on uniswap, and spend that ETH to buy tokens, or sell tokens to get some ETH. There were no middle men. No one can hack uniswap. 

  
Now what happened really? Our core degenerate mindset got us to start building shitcoins by now. 99% of the tokens on uniswap are scams, the users just unlocked and withdrew the liquidity (ETH) with the liquidity pool token. What if the token smart contract was a scam by itself? I will put a list of things for you to see before you buy any shitcoins directly on uniswap.  

\----   
  
**2020 - The birth of DxSale, and other launchpads**

Ah, this is something that takes you to some of the golden age of shitcoins. DxSale and Unicrypt made it easy for anyone to make a token. You didn't need to know how to write contracts anymore, those defi apps made it for you and you own it. Your wallet owns the token as the creator. You can make a token within seconds without knowing how to code, and raise funds in those same apps. Once the funds are raised, it automatically uploaded the token/ETH as a liquidity pair on Uniswap. Uniswap returned the liquidity pool token to the Launchpad smart contracts which automatically locked the liquidity pool (LP) token (key). This solved the number one issue with Uniswap launches, which is scam by unlocking LP and disappearing in to thin air. 

Great, now all you had to do was marketing and you have a token on ethereum, you could either try to launch it hard and make your coin go 100x or if you were a scam - you would've just found another way like dump the team tokens or perhaps add ""fee system""

Out came the rebase tokens, fee tokens, burn tokens etc. People started making custom tokens with some sort of fee at every buys and sells. Scammers decided to make buy fee 1% and sell fee 99%. You can buy but not sell, even if you buy it on launchpads like Dxsale or Dex like Uniswap. Scammers just like to abuse the system in deFi. It's the wild west. You either made a 83500x (yes it happened), or you lost it all. You probably lost it all if you were there in the wild west of 2021. 

dAPP builders though sold the shovels by making these apps in Ethereum and other L2s. The great part is, when we made these apps for Ethereum, it worked on Layer 2 networks like coinbase's Base network, so when another network became popular because of degenerate gamblers - these dApps already supported it. For example Binance smart chain network (BSC) was really popular around 2021-2022. Instead of using eth, people would use BNB to use these apps or make any transaction, BNB was the native currency and liquidity currency of BSC. 



>Was it all just financial or were there other use cases for Ethereum apps?

  
**NFTs: The type of token we never wanted but we still got**

Out came NFTs, ah NFTs... the middle child no one wants to talk about any more. NFTs were tokens that were not divisible. You cannot divide them like a regular token. Which means they had a different use case. You cannot really make it uniswap tradable because you had to buy a full NFT not a 0.00000001 of an NFT. All you can do is list your NFTs and some one else purchases it. 

Instantly, it became synonymous with art (jpegs). dApps like Rarible came out and started trying to be a marketplace for making and listing your NFTs. Some of you paid 100k for a ape's picture. I myself was not into NFTs except for my attempt at building an NFT fighting game. 

Eventually scammers found their way into NFT world as well. They used it to sell NFTs but never build anything else after that. Other ways they've used it is to launder money that they've made from scamming from traditional tokens. NFTs died as fast as they came.

  
**Farming**

One of the best use cases of dApps was farming apps like Beefy. You can earn an apy by using providing liquidity to Beefy farms. You can make a 6-11% by using USDT or a variation of USD (stable coins) which was a safe-ish way to make money. (Luna usd was not safe as we all know).  My own experience with farming was subpar at most, but it's my fault - i was scared of flash crashes of any coins whether they were a good coin or not. However, this is much safer than the shitcoin wild west of launchpads and uniswap. Farming is sort of like managed savings account, you manage the farm you want to gather apy from and hope nothing crashed and wiped you out. 

  
Till 2023, Ethereum and EVMs (Layer 2 networks) looked like it had all the game on their hands. All the app developers are on it. ""There are no other ethereum killer"". Plenty of different networks came and went. I remember trying to learn a different network's code and it just was not worth learning at the time... it was going great for us until... fire nation attacked (Solana). 

\-----   
  
**2024 Solana and it's golden child Pump fun with it's dex Raydium.**

Solana is a different network. It's not a layer 2 of Ethereum. Holy smokes its fast, holy smokes it doesn't work sometimes but when it does, im not spending $10 when i buy or sell a shitcoin. What's uniswap? Raydium is here. Dxsale? Nah son, it's pump fun. No more putting token amount, and calculating how many tokens I get as a developer, and how much for marketing yada yada yada. All it took on pump fun was $1 worth of solana and my solana token was live. I can just live stream on twitch and market my shitcoin. Just last night (relative to when im writing this on nov 24), some guy had his girlfriend inside a cage on twitch and raising funds on pump fun. No more locking liquidity, we burn the liquidity. 

Scammers are no longer only using technical tactics to scam, scammers have gotten dumber but bolder. They're scamming on live stream and showing their face. 

Solana started getting hot, it went 10x within a year due to so many people switching from ETH and other EVMs to play on this hot shiny new tech. Out with solidity coding, Rust is my new best friend. Ethereum killer? Yet to find out, but this is the only network that came this close.

You want to be in this new wild west? All you need is Phantom wallet with Real Solana (not CEX solana), connect to dApps like raydium or pump fun and start your degeneracy. Just like 2021, either you make 80,000x or zero. Most of the time you lose everything.

I was one of the loser dApp founders who decided not to sell shovels in this new wild west of Solana. I am now outwitted by Solana companies.   
\-----

**Bridge:**

So how do you stay decentralized while moving funds from ETH/EVM L2s to the new wild west solana? Thats where bridge ""dApp"" came from. The reason I put quotation is because they are not quite decentralized. They have some sort of code in between to move funds from one network to other for you with a fee. However by doing this, you avoid putting large sums of money into an exchange and getting it stuck due to whatever reasons. Perhaps you wanted to avoid identification (KYC) and linking it to your bank. deBridge is a very good bridge that everyone uses. Very easy to use. 

Bridges have been prone to be hacked due to their centralized nature in between the networks. Cross chain bridges are easier to hack than any dApps. 

  
\----   
**How do you avoid getting scammed or hacked or just in general lose money in Defi?**

* If you are diving into the old world of EVMs, remember the tokens can have variable fees like I've mentioned before. Use tools like tokensniffer to see if it's something similar. If a coin has 99% sell fee, it means you can buy but cannot sell.
* Check dextools or dexscreeners for the shitcoin to see how much liquidity is there, whether it's locked on Dxlock or Unicrypt, or whether it's burned. 
* Check if it's a honey pot. Many times, a hot token on these chart apps will have 150k liquidity but only 500 holders. If it's 150k liquidity, assume it should have over 3000 holders. 
* Check if it's a CTO (Community take over coin). Many scammers now a days rug pull their own coins, and perform a CTO with another telegram or twitter account. They pretend to be community member who's hell bent on getting this shitcoin up and running again. They rug it for the second time. Avoid CTOs.
* I highly suggest checking solana based token's advice on how to check for scams as I am not the best person for Solana based shitcoin scams. 
* Never connect to unknown dApps. Defi is a world where YOU are responsible. Some dApps out there can drain your wallet. Do not connect or sign things on your wallet that you don't know what it's for. Always do your research on the dApps. 
* If you are new and not used to trenches, be prepared to lose 99.99% of your sol or eth on shitcoins. That's how you learn what to look out for, honestly..
* Do not buy NFTs at the moment, they are dead.
* If you are not within the first 10 buyers of a hot shitcoin, you are last. You will be exit liquidity. Many marketcaps reach 10 million market cap then back down to 100k. It is what it is. Buy high sell low logic applies almost every time.

**2027 and beyond - Has bitcoin become a dinosaur? What's next for DeFi?**

  
This is a very good topic and maybe an insight that you'd like to know for the next in this crypto wild west of Defi. Yes bitcoin is old, bitcoin is slow. However, bitcoin has and always will be king. It does not print like eth or solana. 

>  
But what about making shitcoins on Bitcoin? Can Bitcoin have something like Eth or Sol?

  
There already is something like that, it's called ""Runes"". Runes is a HOT new protocol that uses Bitcoin's messaging system to let you make tokens (they're called runes on bitcoin). It's a slow protocol currently which takes about 10 minutes to 30 minutes for a transaction and costs alot. It congests bitcoin miners. 

Crypto is all about the hot new thing. The hot new thing always comes one cycle earlier and gets popular in the next cycle. I will explain the cycles in the next topic. One hot shitcoin equivalent of runes is called DOG\*GO\*TO\*THE\*MOON ($DOG). It's the biggest rune currently on the bitcoin ecosystem. Its around 1B mcap already. 

Why am I mentioning Runes? I am not sure whether Runes will be the next big thing. However I do know one thing, bitcoin has the biggest maxis and biggest share of the market. Runes protocol opened up DeFi for bitcoin. If you want to make your own runes, you can download Magic Eden Wallet or Phantom Wallet, and use Magic Eden Wallet to trade runes.

Using the same messaging system, there's also an NFT equivalent called ""Ordinals"". I would not buy Ordinals , it will suffer the same fate as NFTs. 

The beauty of Runes is that the native currency is Bitcoin. There are no other coins that you need to buy before you dive into Runes shitcoin narratives. Could it beat 2024 Solana world? Who knows? All I know is, a few dApp builders are racing to solve a few problems with the runes ecosystem including myself. 

>  
What about SUI? My crypto friend was talking about SUI at work

  
Do your own research about SUI. It could also very well be the next Solana. SUI is much faster than Bitcoin Runes so it's easy to use. Only time will tell whether a slow titan (Bitcoin) or a small chain like SUI will win the next cycles hype.

\----

  
**Narrative advice**

Every cycle, check for the next narrative. You can buy and hope that your picks become the hot new topic in the next cycle. Something that is brewing now like bitcoin runes shitcoins or dapps OR sui native coin, sui shit tokens or dapps might be the winner in 2027. It's upto the dApp developers to come up with the hot new shovel that will drive these type of narratives. 



# Crypto Cycles and Insight

I am sure you've heard about the bitcoin halving cycles and have learned that majority of the people use these cyclical nature to buy low and sell high. 6 months post halving is when bull run tends to start. A few months later Alt season where the alt coins (ETH, Solana etc.) start to run and it ends with a bang with memes. 

However, in 2024, we've started with memes. There was a huge pump before halving and some people are saying that the cycle is left shifted. Others are saying that this is a super cycle. No matter what happens and have already happened, if you look at the chart, 2022 was the lowest point that your crypto expert friend have DCA'd through. They have already expected that halving or around halving will be the bull run. So far they look like geniuses, but a dump will come again eventually. It's your job to understand how the previous cycles worked and how this cycle is so far. Find similarities and differences between the previous cycles and this cycle. 

Some example of similarities:

* Halving again called the bull run (controversial I know - you may have another opinion)
* BTC climbing before alt season truly starts
* We are in phase 4 of bitcoin cycle (again controversial)
* We are in Belief or Thrill stage in psychology of market  (controversial)

  
Some examples of differences:

* Meme season started first this time around
* Pre halving pump
* Institutional acceptance (American and Global ETFs)

  
With these differences, you must make your own judgement. Does institutional acceptance mean a super cycle? Do these new boomers who buy the ETFs pull out fast because they think a gain of 20% is a gain of 2 years ? But crypto is used to 300% - 400% minimum.. what happens now? 

No one knows honestly, and everyone's entry point is different. It's up to you when you want to enter. You can either enter now in this part of cycle or enter during a bear market in 2 years. What if the bear market does not come for 4 years? Do you just sit on fiat?

Only YOU can make your decision, I am just here to provide you with some history and narrative.   


>Okay I want to enter now, what are my options? What are the narratives? I understood Defi and bitcoin cycles but what about meme , AI or gaming narratives? 

  
Meme season is a very risky season, the pumps will come without any build up and dump before you can pull out. The pumps usually last 1 day before a 90% dump

AI and Gaming are a hit or miss, you can do your own research to see whether any of those coins pumped right before halving. If they did, perhaps they are the winning horse you want to take on. 

>Overall, do your own research into the winning horses and sit tight. If they're already in All time high (ATH), perhaps avoid it since it's in ""price discovery"". Once it's in price discovery you must be ready to DCA out (take profits), instead of timing the top. No one knows where the top is. **Currently Alt Season has yet to start. Bitcoin needs to stop before Alts pump.**

  


Macroeconomics

This is another controversial topic as others may have other opinions but aside from halving where the supply is cut, interest rate of Global liquidity (USD) still has a large part to play with bitcoin price. When they print USD out of thin air for cheap (low interest), investors tend to put it into stocks , real estate and crypto. With halving cutting the supply of fresh bitcoin, and interest rates dropping - bitcoin price against USD is climbing hard and fast.  

ETFs in the west have also put a strain on the demand. Demand has outweighed so much that every day the boomers are purchasing 40 days of fresh supply of bitcoin. Currently they're buying OTC (over the counter) in bulk from bitcoin holders who held for years. They're not buying from the exchanges.. if they did, the price would've shot up much more. However, there will come a time where OTC dries up and they either tap into cex, and dex or their ETF prices start to climb. This will make bitcoin price go up regardless. 

When Bitcoin and it's ETFs have climbed to a significant amount of market cap, they will jump into ETH ETFs. That will signal the alt season and alt coins will start to climb. 

There are 2 rumoured Solana ETF filings in 2024 as well. 

^(I am sure, you guys are very well versed in macro economics, it would be great to have more additions into this chapter here. This is a deep topic that requires your help.)

# Do's and Don'ts

1. If you are new, do not have expectations with memecoins or shitcoins. DYOR. If you are not first 10 you are last.
2. If you are new, avoid price discovery coins. Buy coins that climbed before halving (winning horses) but not yet ATH from earlier. They will reach their ATH and go past ATH into price discovery. Examples below:
   1. ETH - Not yet price discovery
   2. SOL - Just flirting with price discovery and ATH
   3. BTC - Well into price discovery
3. If you are in Defi wild west, please read the DeFi section to understand the game. Start with money you are okay with losing. Get into X spaces, X and telegram / discord groups before you buy blindly. Read the smart contracts or use token sniffer or charting tools to look at tokenomics and metrics.
4. If you are getting into building, look at new narratives rather than current narratives. You are already too late. 
5. If you are a shitcoin owner, please know that scamming will get you caught. I have seen too many getting caught and its well deserved.
6. Do not believe X influencers or Youtubers, when they're shilling something, they're usually in on it. 
7. Do not blindly believe any thing you read on Yahoo Finance, and any other crypto news outlets. Yahoo finance and other news outlets have paid articles ranging from $500 to 25k. 
8. Do not blindly believe a new shiller DMing you about this next new hot coin thats launched, they're paid shillers on X or telegram. 
9. Do not connect to any unknown dAPPs.
10. Do not keep your money in CEX, or hot wallet keep it inside ledger. I am guilty myself of this and might get screwed any time.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Never trust AltcoinDaily YouTube channel,2024-11-24 08:45:47,"I knew already that they are shilling alts, but I decided to do an experiment:

There was a video before halving about alts who are going to ""explode"" soon. I invested like 10 usd into every coin which was available on my exchange. This is what I have now:

XCAD 58% down

BICO 40% down

IMX 25% down

ZETA 32% down

GMT 13% down

MINA 12% down

EGLD 9% down

RUNE 7% down

COTI 5% up

SUPER 32% up

From 10 coins only 2 are up, and from 2 only 1 has a significant gain. I'm not saying that they are not going to pump, I'm still holding till Q3 2025 but it was pretty bad advice and during bad time. Remember - they advertised them as ""hidden gems"" who will do x10

To be honest that YouTube channel makes me sick now, it's like legal scam advertising dead coins and getting paid by creators, they are 100% biased. I'm surprised they have so many subscribers so I just want to warn you - if you watch it, just use reverse psychology and do everything opposite than what they say",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"A reminder to track your crypto exhaustively, for emotional health",2024-11-25 12:57:39,"I started in crypto the month after lunc crashed. Overall it was a great time to get in with huge buying opportunities. I didn't know what I was doing so I mostly squandered those opportunities, but getting in on that relatively epic dip means even an idiot like me can make money. It didn't take long before I was trading on multiple exchanges and using multiple defi wallets.

Tracking all of that is tough, and I haven't found any pre-made solution that could do it seamlessly. Ultimately I just had to write my own Python code that could read the downloaded logs from each exchange with their different formatting. It was a pain, but it's been so worth it. In addition to making taxes possible to calculate (yay?) it provides a practical check on my gut feeling of how I'm doing, and that's probably kept me in the crypto game when I might have sold on previous dips.

For me, I mentally latch on to my biggest losses. Recently I made a particularly bad call, put in *as much as I could afford to lose* on one asset, and then immediately lost it. Totally lost, and it's not coming back. That shook me. Of course life still goes on, but it was hard for me to still think about investing money after such a thorough loss. I could have spent that money on so many fun or useful things... I was sad for a day or two, but I kept looking at my full portfolio, and the thing is, as big and pointless as that loss was, I'm still up maybe 10x the amount I lost on that dumb gamble. 

Ultimately that's reminded me that even if I make dumb decisions sometimes, overall I'm doing the right thing, and I can't fixate on one particular loss (nor should we overly fixate on one particular gain lest we forget the possibility to make mistakes).",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Calm down!  It’s another day at the office, nothing out of the ordinary, buy the dips, hold the plan, dca all day!

We are here because we believe in the projects and the overall goals ( or at least should be ), and nothing has changed except the train is now picking up speed and it will be exponential to all our original starting points around this time in the journey.

So sit down, shut up, and hold on, because it’s gonna wobble, May go up, May go down, but ultimately, we ain’t seen nothing yet, and that is the most indisputable factor of the crypto space!

So, like me, continue to add and take advantage of these little dips as they are all apart of the A++ dca and hodl game by buying at the various points and best of all dips or reconsolidations, and one day we will look back on this from a secured financial point of our own individual journey and will have stories and stories to tell.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

I wanted to reach out and apologize for removing my recent post about AMBER256. Upon reflection, I realized that I currently lack the necessary expertise to develop a robust cryptographic algorithm. My intention was never to spread an unsound or insecure algorithm, and I believe it's important to prevent the dissemination of potentially flawed cryptographic methods.

Before I revisit this project, I plan to dedicate significant time to studying existing implementations and understanding possible attacks. My goal is to ensure that any future contributions I make are both meaningful and secure.

I am sincerely sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. I also want to thank everyone who offered support and constructive feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your understanding.

Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to engaging with the community again once I have gained more knowledge in this field.",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918
Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Proof of Possession: Does a Schnorr Signature done with the sum of 2 Elliptic Curve private keys prove possession of the 2 individual keys?,2024-10-24 10:57:36,"G is the Generator of a Discrete Log Hard Elliptic Curve Group.

2 Private keys x1 & x2, corresponding Public Keys P1 = x1G & P2 = x2G.

Now P = P1 + P2 is also a public key with corresponding private key x = x1 + x2.

If I sign (Schnorr Signature) with x, does it only prove possession of the private key corresponding to P or does it also prove possession of the 2 individual public keys x1 & x2? Or if not proof of possession of both x1 & x2, does it atleast prove something more than just x?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ?

I am working on a lattice system based on the ISIS problem. ChatGPT keeps thinking this is a terrorist form of cryptography, but it's just inhomogeneous short integer solution.  With that out the way, I'm wondering about short secret generation. I've become partial to using a Gaussian distribution to sample from a set of integers. It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations? 

What's the deal?

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past.

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

NOTE = I don't know if I'll release the code on github, surely at the moment it's a bit messy :P",2024-11-26 12:20:24.488918

i think if i stick to the principle of avoiding using any kind of ""required"" service provider (myself included) and allowing the frontend and the peerjs-server to be hosted independently, im on track for creating a chat system with the ""fewest moving parts"". im hope you will agree this is true p2p and i hope i can use this as a step towards unparalleled privacy and security.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.
