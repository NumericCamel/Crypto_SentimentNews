His technical analysis, which is based on SOL price action on the daily candlestick timeframe, shows that the altcoin has been trading in an uptrend channel since July 2024. Notably, this uptrend channel has been highlighted by the formation of higher lows and higher highs as Solana continued to push to new all-time highs. Now, Martinez noted that holding above a key support level could reinforce the altcoin’s uptrend towards the upper trendline of the support channel. Related Reading: Bold Prediction: XRP Holders On The Path To Millionaire Status—Analyst Analyst’s Technical Outlook: A Make-Or-Break Support Level At the time of Martinez’s analysis, Solana was trading at $193, following a barrage of declines throughout last week. Notably, this decline saw Solana hit the bottom trendline of this uptrend channel. As such, the analyst noted that SOL’s action from here could determine its next big move.  If Solana manages to hold above this support level, the uptrend could regain strength, and the channel will still be in play. In this case, Solana will still be on track to push toward the upper end of the channel, which puts the price target around $387. On the other hand, if the support fails, a deeper correction could be on the table. Image From X: Ali_charts Solana Price Action: A Rollercoaster Ride To $293 And Back SOL is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the current crypto cycle, with its price recently skyrocketing to a new all-time high of $293 on January 19. The rally was primarily driven by a wave of interest following the launch of the Official Trump meme coin on the Solana blockchain, adding momentum to an already bullish trend for the altcoin. However, the euphoria has since cooled off, with Solana experiencing a 30% decline since the all-time high.  Since the time of the analysis, Solana has managed to rebound slightly from the lower boundary of its uptrend channel. Solana is currently trading at $204, meaning it has increased by about 5.7% since Martinez highlighted the key support zone. This reversal suggests that the uptrend channel is still in play, and Solana could continue to push upwards until it reaches $389. Interestingly, this price target at the upper end of the channel is reinforced by the Fibonacci extension indicator. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst This indicator is extended from the Solana low of $109 in August 2024, and the $389 price target is at the 1.272 extension level. The significance of this extension is reinforced by the fact that Solana’s January peak also coincided with the 1.0 Fibonacci level. Despite this recovery, the bullish momentum has yet to fully confirm itself with a strong breakout. There is still a possibility that Solana could retest the lower boundary of the channel again before establishing a more decisive uptrend.

Currently, the prominent altcoin finds itself in a consolidation zone potentially gathering momentum for its next breakout. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1, XRP To $6, And Solana To $1,000? Pundit Says You’re Not Bullish Enough XRP Price At Crucial Juncture In a recent X post, popular digital asset expert Egrag Crypto shared a technical analysis of the XRP market presenting both possible bullish and bearish scenarios. This analysis was based on Fibonacci retracement levels which identifies potential support and resistance levels and the 21-day exponential moving average which smoothens out price data giving more weight to recent prices. According to Egrag Crypto, XRP is expected to range between $2.27 (Fib 0.382) and $2.45 ( Fib 0.5). However, there is potential for prices to swing within a wider boundary of $2.06 (Fib 0.236) – $2.65 (0.618). Notably, the altcoin gained by 1.67% in the past day. However, a daily price close above the 21 EMA which is currently at $2.70 is crucial in confirming any uptrend.  Interestingly, if market bulls are able to force a strong close above $2.80 (Fib 0.702), this would suggest a major bullish signal indicating the current XRP buying pressure is sufficient to break higher resistance levels. On the other hand, Egrag Crypto warns that traders must avoid any price fall to $1.77 which may not necessarily invalidate the current bullish structure but would suggest rising bearish pressure. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Recent Crypto Dip Shows Decline May Be Over And Bulls Are Taking Charge XRP Market Overview  At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.49 after a 4.43% increase in the last 24 hours as previously stated. However, the asset’s trading volume is down by 56.85% indicating a lack of interest and uncertainty in the market. However, considering XRP’s overall bearish form in the last seven days, a fall in trading volume may also suggest reduced selling pressure pointing to a potential reversal. Generally, XRP investors remain bullish on the asset’s prospects driven by several factors but most notably by the potential of an XRP Spot ETF. In the past week, there were significant developments on that front as the Chicago Board Options Exchange filed 19b-4 applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking to list and trade the XRP spot ETFs proposed by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21 Shares, and Canary. Once the SEC acknowledges receipt of these applications, the US regulator is granted a 45-day window – with potential extensions of up to 240 days – to assess and make an approval decision on the proposed ETFs.  Featured image from Trackinsight, chart from Tradingview",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

However, technical analysis from analyst Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin may have already established its cycle bottom before the next price surge. Dogecoin Tests Key Weekly Support After 40% Drop The cryptocurrency market faced a significant downturn last week, with widespread losses hitting various digital assets. Dogecoin was no exception to the sell-off, experiencing a sharp decline of nearly 40% before finding support around $0.22. This drop marked the lowest price Dogecoin has reached since the beginning of 2025, and the last time it traded at this level was in early November 2024.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Set For A 10-Fold Explosion? Analysts Predict 6,000% Surge Despite the severity of the drop, technical analysis from crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade suggests that Dogecoin’s recent 2025 low may be more significant than it appears at first glance. In a social media post on platform X, the analyst shared a weekly timeframe chart highlighting that $0.22 is part of a key trendline that played a crucial role in Dogecoin’s price movements throughout 2024. Now, with the price falling back to this level and bouncing off it, Trader Tardigrade noted that the trendline has seemingly flipped into a strong support zone. As of now, Dogecoin has rebounded to $0.2561, reflecting a positive reaction of approximately 16% from its recent low. Notably, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows buyers stepped in just around this support level. However, Dogecoin’s ability to hold above this support level in the coming weeks will determine if the cryptocurrency has truly reached a bottom for the rest of this cycle.  Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Historical Pullbacks Point To $2 Price Target In another analysis, Trader Tardigrade highlighted a recurring pattern in which the Dogecoin price tends to experience significant pullbacks of more than 50% after a strong multi-month rally. However, these pullbacks have always been accompanied by another strong rebound rally, and Dogecoin eventually reached a new peak. His analysis noted three major pullbacks: the first saw a decline of 59.76%, the second dropped by 56.2%, and the most recent pullback registered a 58.25% drop. Based on this historical behavior, Tardigrade noted that the recent correction might be accompanied by another strong rebound.  The last such a rebound happened, Dogecoin went on a 23,000% increase to reach its current all-time high of $0.73. From here, Trader Tardigrade predicted a similar playout to reach a price target of $2. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Related Reading: Final Dip?

Interestingly, this development coincided with a bearish trading week for Ethereum, during which its price declined by 16.18%. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs Suffer $186 Million Outflows As New Year Struggles Persist – Details Ethereum Spot ETFs Register $420 Million Inflows Amid Price Fall As prices of Ethereum struggled to find market stability in the past week, the Ethereum Spot ETFs experienced an increased level of market interest translating into a net inflow of $420 million. Data from SoSoValue show the ETH ETFs pulled inflows significantly larger than the $203 million registered by the Bitcoin Spot ETFs despite the premier cryptocurrency having a better price performance.  Commenting on this eye-catching development, Coinbase analysts have attributed Ethereum ETF performance to a spiked interest in ETH as a preferred asset for CME basis trade over Bitcoin.   For context, the CME basis trade is a common trading strategy where market participants go long on an asset in the spot market and short in the future market with intentions to profit from the difference in market prices. According to data from Coinbase, CME ETH basis trade produced a higher gain (16%) than that of Bitcoin (10%) over the last week translating into an increased market institutional interest in the Spot ETFs.  Of the reported net inflows in the Ethereum ETF market, BlackRock’s ETHA remains investors’ favorite with total net deposits of $286.81 million. Unsurprisingly, Fidelity’s FETH came second with aggregate investments of $97.28 million. Grayscale’s ETHE, ETH, Bitwise’s ETHW, and 21 Shares’ CETH also recorded modest net inflows between $4 million -$18 million. Meanwhile, Invesco’s QETH, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, and VanEck’s ETHV all record zero net flows. Over the last trading week, the Ethereum Spot ETFs saw their net assets decline to $9.88 billion despite a net positive flow. At the time of writing, these ETFs now control 3.17% of the ETH market cap.

According to its daily trading chart, the Ethereum Relative Strength Index is currently at 34.03 heading in an upward direction. This data suggests strong potential for a price reversal following last week’s price crash. In driving any price rally, market bulls will encounter strong resistance in the $3400 price zone, pushing past which could allow a return to the local market peak of $4,000.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Spikes On Major Exchanges — Time To Buy?,2025-02-09 16:00:04+00:00,"The price of Bitcoin has not shown any serious momentum so far in 2025 besides briefly surpassing the $108,000 level in mid-January. On the contrary, the flagship cryptocurrency has suffered some significant corrections over the past few weeks. The most recent pullback saw the BTC price heavily slump toward $92,000 after US President Donald Trump introduced new trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China earlier this week. While the Bitcoin price quickly recovered above $100,000, it has since struggled to sustain any bullish momentum — currently trading around $96,500. HTX And BitMEX Users Load Their Bitcoin Bags — What We Know Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share that certain centralized exchanges have witnessed increased buying activity. This on-chain observation is based on changes in the “taker buy/sell ratio,” which measures the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a particular asset (Bitcoin, in this case). Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1, XRP To $6, And Solana To $1,000? Pundit Says You’re Not Bullish Enough For clarity, the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume when the value of the taker buy/sell ratio is greater than one. Typically, this scenario is considered bullish, as it suggests the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for a specific cryptocurrency (Bitcoin). Contrastingly, a less-than-one value for the taker buy/sell ratio indicates that more sellers are willing to part with their assets at a lower price. This phenomenon implies that the sellers are overtaking the buyers, signaling a bearish investor sentiment in a particular crypto market. According to Martinez’s post on X, the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio on the HTX and BitMEX exchanges experienced a notable upswing on Saturday, February 8. CryptoQuant data shows that the metric rose to around 5.7 on the BitMEX platform in the late hours of the day. Similarly, the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio climbed to as high as 16 on the HTX exchange on Saturday before later crashing down toward 0.4. Nonetheless, this piece of on-chain data indicates a spike in buying activity on the centralized trading platforms. Fresh buying activity on crypto exchanges could be bullish for the Bitcoin price, which has lacked the bite needed to sustain any upward movement. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at around $96,700, reflecting no significant price change in the past 24 hours. Is It Time To Buy BTC? In a separate post on X, Martinez suggested that it might be time for investors to dabble back into the BTC market. The rationale behind this suggestion is based on how the crypto crowd is feeling at the moment.

Crypto Investment Firm CEO Predicts Massive Surge,2025-02-09 14:30:21+00:00,"The Bitcoin space is buzzing again, but this time with eyebrow-raising predictions that seem almost too good to be true. Abra Global’s CEO Bill Barhydt has stepped into the spotlight with a series of ambitious forecasts that have left many in the crypto community both excited and skeptical. His vision for Bitcoin’s future price tag? A staggering $350,000. Related Reading: Final Dip? Dogecoin Correction Could Precede A Record Surge—Analyst A Tale Of Two Economic Forces The basis of Barhydt’s forecasts is mostly on expected changes in American monetary policy. Reduced interest rates and possible quantitative easing are supposed to flood the market with fresh cash, generating what he sharply refers to as a “Cyclical Valhalla.” Though the actions of the Federal Reserve to control the trillion-dollar debt load of the country could have an impact on the crypto markets, the link is not as clear-cut as some would have you believe. My base case for for current crypto cycle (NFA) Bitcoin – $350k Ethereum – $8,000 Solana – $900 Sui – $25 High end of range is ~2x these values. My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower and they’ll do whatever they have to to achieve that. They… — Bill Barhydt (@billbarX) February 8, 2025 Beyond Bitcoin: Altcoins In The Spotlight Although Bitcoin takes front stage, Barhydt’s crystal ball still remembers other cryptocurrencies. While Solana can possibly soar to $900, Ethereum sees hitting $8,000. These projections exceed even other optimistic expectations, including VanEck’s $520 target for Solana, and they well outweigh present values. With a forecasted increase to $25 based mostly on its connection with Bitcoin’s movements, the less well-known SUI token has not gone unnoticed either. The ETF Effect: A New Chapter Or False Dawn Indeed, fresh optimism is brought by the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the market. For instance, the month of February saw a flow of $755 million into Bitcoin ETFs when the US CPI data was released. This illustrates the ever-increasing appetite of institutions to get exposure to crypto assets. Yet this mere snapshot of success cannot be read in isolation. These inflows are not sustainable, while past performance does not guarantee future results. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Set For A 10-Fold Explosion? Analysts Predict 6,000% Surge Reading Between The Lines: What’s Missing Despite the appealing narrative, several crucial factors deserve closer scrutiny. The analysis largely ignores potential headwinds such as regulatory challenges, technological risks, and market manipulation concerns. Barhydt’s confidence in a “brass balls” approach to investing might resonate with crypto enthusiasts, but it glosses over the sophisticated risk management strategies that institutional investors typically employ. The way the crypto market interacts with conventional economic data is not set in stone. Although historically simpler monetary policy corresponds with asset price inflation, the maturing of the crypto market could produce different results this time. It is probable that astute investors will adopt a balanced approach to these predictions, recognizing both the substantial risks and the potential opportunities that await them.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Holds Above $96,000 — Analyst Explains This Level’s Significance",2025-02-09 13:00:17+00:00,"The Bitcoin price appears to have settled within the $92,000 – $102,000 consolidation range, sparking discussions about the coin’s future trajectory. While it remains unclear whether the premier cryptocurrency has enough momentum to forge new all-time highs soon, it would take significant bearish pressure to pull down the BTC price. Nevertheless, the latest on-chain data shows a specific level that could be crucial to the Bitcoin price in the short term. Here’s How $96,000 Could Be Critical To BTC Price In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym ShayanBTC explained how the realized price of a certain investor class could influence the Bitcoin price trajectory in the short-to-mid term. This analysis revolves around the Realized Price of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) age bands, which evaluate the holding pattern of different investor cohorts through different realized prices. The UTXO age bands metric measures the average price at which Bitcoin holders purchased their coins compared to how long they’ve held the assets. The relevant age band in ShayanBTC’s analysis is the 1-month to 3-month group, which offers insight into “short-term holders’ behavior and overall market sentiment.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Desert Market: Number Of $100,000 Transactions Nosedives 70% According to the Quicktake analyst, the realized price of Bitcoin holders in this short-term investor cohort has historically served as critical support levels. Historically, the Bitcoin price has often found a cushion above this realized price, suggesting that investors are doubling down on their positions. Recent data from CryptoQuant shows that the Bitcoin price is currently holding above the realized price of the 1-3 month cohort. As of this writing, this UTXO age band’s average purchase price is around the $96,000 mark. ShayanBTC highlighted the importance of the Bitcoin price holding above $96,000 in maintaining the current bullish narrative. “Holding above this key level reinforces a bullish market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of an extended upward trend,” the Quicktake analyst noted. On the flip side, a breach beneath the crucial $96,000 support could trigger a shift in investor sentiment from confidence to fear. Ultimately, the failure of this crucial level could force some investors to distribute their coins, threatening the upward trajectory of the BTC price. Bitcoin Price Stays Above $96k As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $96,500, reflecting no significant move in the past 24 hours. After starting the week above $100,000, the flagship cryptocurrency quickly fell toward $92,000 due to bearish pressure triggered by new US trade policies. According to CoinGecko data, the price of BTC is down by nearly 4% in the past week. Related Reading: 49,700 Dormant Bitcoin Just Moved—What’s Next For BTC’s Price?

Can the Biggest Presale $WEPE 100x?,2025-02-09 12:00:03+00:00,"Fred Thiel, the CEO of Marathon Digital, a Bitcoin mining giant, is extremely bullish on Bitcoin and predicts it can reach $200K in 2025. BTC is currently trading around the $97,000 mark, which means it can double from current prices as per Fred. The CEO credits a pro-crypto regulatory environment post the appointment of Trump as a major driving force behind Bitcoin. As debanking gradually ends, an increasing number of banks will be able to serve crypto startups. This would encourage more businesses to put BTC on their balance sheets. As demand increases, so does the price. Now, unlike gold and silver, you can’t just extract BTC out of thin air. The supply is only limited to 21M coins. If businesses start holding Bitcoin, the prices are bound to increase. Furthermore, there are talks of various US states leaning towards building a Bitcoin reserve. If the idea does go through, another 1% of the supply would be needed, which will push the prices more. ‘So I think there is still a big belief that Bitcoin will continue to go up in price. There’s still a lot of demand for the asset by not just retail but also institutional investors.’ – Fred Thiel. Donald Trump Thirsty for a Tariff War While Bitcoin is nicely set up for an upward move in the long run, the journey won’t be smooth, thanks to the upcoming tariff war kindled by Donald Trump. After the tariffs imposed on Mexico and China last week, Trump said more tariffs will be imposed next week, where ‘everyone’ will be impacted. Although Trump didn’t specify which sectors will be targeted, the automobile industry definitely seems to be one. Trump isn’t a big fan of VAT imposed by the EU on American exports. A tit-for-tat move is expected. Steel, oil, and pharmaceuticals are some other industries that may be on the President’s radar. $BTC fell to around $91,000 during the last tariff announcement, and we may see another fall come next week. Short-term $BTC traders might see some volatility in the coming few weeks. However, the long-term view still stays positive as several analysts have predicted an upward move for Bitcoin towards the $200K mark. When the tariffs are in full swing, investors should look to bank on yet-to-be-listed coins that aren’t impacted by market volatility, i.e., crypto presales. If you’re on the lookout for the next crypto to explode, there’s hardly any better than Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE). What Is $WEPE? Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a meme coin inspired by the famous frog meme (the same as $PEPE and $PEPU), looking to take forward the frog legacy but with a focus on small investors. $WEPE aims to put the power of crypto trading in the hands of retail participants instead of a select few whales. For a long time now, the crypto markets have been dictated by whales with exclusive access to classified information and news. However, Wall Street Pepe will change all that. All $WEPE token holders will get access to exclusive alpha calls and market information, which was earlier reserved for whales. This community of token holders, known as the $WEPE army, can access meme coin strategies and market updates, which will help them stay a step ahead of the institutional players. $WEPE’s community initiative has started well, too. It has amassed 45K followers on X and an active Telegram group. Last Chance to Buy $WEPE $WEPE’s idea has resonated well with the crypto community. The presale has been a massive hit, raising more than $70M. Seeing as it’s still going strong, Wall Street Pepe is now the biggest new meme coin presale after $PEPU, which raised $73M. $PEPU, which was also driven by the frog meme, made a massive 800% return for its investors. If $WEPE manages to achieve even half of that, it will go way past the 100x mark, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now. The $WEPE presale is in its last stretch. Although 7 days still remain, the tokens are much more likely to be sold out before that. Available at a current price of $0.0003665, this is easily the lowest you’ll ever see Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) at. Buying $WEPE is pretty simple, too. Just head over to the official $WEPE presale website and link your crypto wallet (like Best Wallet). Then, ensure you have enough ETH, BNB, or USDT to purchase the number of tokens you want. Also, keep some extra ETH for gas fees. Next, punch in the number of tokens you want to buy and approve the transaction from your wallet. Final Words It’s important to remember that with a tariff war looming large, the markets are expected to be pretty volatile. Therefore, you must do your own research before investing your hard-earned money in crypto. Also, this article isn’t financial advice.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Indicator Signals Short-Term Holders Have Been Taking Profits – Is The Next Rally Near?,2025-02-09 11:30:59+00:00,"Bitcoin is trading below the $100K mark after enduring a volatile and turbulent week. The cryptocurrency faced extreme selling pressure last Sunday, dropping over 9% in less than 24 hours. Although Bitcoin managed a slight recovery on Monday, the selling pressure has persisted, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate 100 Million Dogecoin In 24 Hours – Demand Signals Growing Confidence Key metrics shared by Axel Adler on X shed light on the current state of Bitcoin’s price action. According to Adler, the Bitcoin Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV indicator has declined from $98K and a value of 1.35 to average levels. This drop suggests that short-term holders have been actively taking profits during this period of heightened volatility. The STH MVRV is a critical indicator for assessing market sentiment among short-term participants. Historically, values above 1.30–1.35 signal an overheated market, often leading to sell-offs. The recent decline in the indicator indicates that some short-term holders have exited their positions, potentially marking the end of a local overheated phase. As Bitcoin consolidates below $100K, market participants are keeping a close eye on key support and resistance levels, hoping to identify the next big move in this unpredictable market environment. For now, profit-taking and volatility dominate the narrative. Bitcoin Faces Persistent Selling Pressure As Short-Term Holders Exit Positions Bitcoin has been grappling with heightened volatility and selling pressure since the start of February, a trend that has negatively impacted altcoins and meme coins, leading to bearish price action across the market. Analysts are increasingly calling for a correction as bulls show signs of fatigue and price movements suggest further declines could be on the horizon. Key insights from CryptoQuant, shared by Axel Adler on X, reveal an important shift in market dynamics. The Bitcoin Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV indicator, a critical tool for gauging short-term holder behavior, has declined from $98K and 1.35 to average levels. This drop indicates that short-term holders have been taking profits amid the recent market volatility. Historically, an STH MVRV above 1.30–1.35 signals an overheated market, often preceding significant sell-offs. The current decline in the indicator suggests that a portion of short-term holders have exited their positions, relieving some pressure on the market. A return to average levels typically marks the end of a local overheated phase. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns If demand remains strong, Bitcoin is likely to enter a consolidation or sideways trading phase following this period of profit-taking. However, a drop in the STH MVRV below 1.0 would signal the formation of a local bottom, potentially setting the stage for a future rally. As the market navigates this period of uncertainty, monitoring these key metrics will be crucial in anticipating Bitcoin’s next move. Price Struggles to Find Direction Below $100K Bitcoin is trading at $96,700 after several days of sideways movement within a tight range between $100,000 and $95,600. The price has been unable to establish a clear direction, with bulls losing control after failing to hold the $100K mark last Tuesday. This lack of momentum has created an atmosphere of uncertainty in the market, leaving traders on edge as Bitcoin hovers near key support levels. The short-term outlook for Bitcoin remains unclear, as neither bulls nor bears have managed to take decisive control. If Bitcoin fails to hold above the critical $95K support level, a deeper decline into the $90K demand zone could follow. Such a move would signal increased selling pressure, potentially dampening sentiment further and extending the current consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Consolidating After The Flush Last Weekend – The Calm Before A Big Move? On the other hand, reclaiming the $100K level is crucial for bulls to regain control and push the price higher. However, without a strong push above this psychological resistance, Bitcoin’s price action is likely to remain choppy and uncertain. Market participants are watching closely for any signs of a breakout or breakdown, as the next move could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. For now, caution remains the prevailing sentiment. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Top 6 Meme Coins to Buy as SEC Acknowledges First-Ever Solana ETF Application,2025-02-09 11:23:40+00:00,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally acknowledged a bid to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Solana. The bid was filed by Grayscale, a crypto asset management firm. This is particularly noteworthy because it reflects a change of heart of the top regulatory body. After all, the SEC rejected a similar bid just six weeks ago.  However, that was before Donald Trump arrived in the White House. So, this is another clear signal that the new US government is very crypto-friendly. Combined with $SOL holding support and remaining stable, an ETF is indeed very bullish news for the blockchain, and by extension, its meme coins. Here are 6 cryptos that could benefit from $SOL-based ETFs and yield handsome returns for you. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Meme Coin to Buy as Solana ETF Becomes a Reality As the launch of Solana ETFs draws closer, Solaxy ($SOLX) is set to be the biggest beneficiary of Solana’s upcoming bull run.  This is because Solaxy is the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network and, as such, is going to remove the biggest issues that have been plaguing Solana Layer 1 chains. By combining the goodness of both Ethereum and Solana – $SOLX is a multi-chain token – Solaxy will increase Solana’s ability to scale and carry out orders simultaneously. This means no more failed transactions or slower throughputs on Solana. Also, transactions will be carried out faster and for lower costs than before. All things considered, it’s no wonder $SOLX is being touted as the next crypto to explode. With close to $19M in presale funding so far, the $SOLX presale has proved the project’s hype and worth. You can join now for just $0.00163 per token. Here’s how to buy $SOLX. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Crypto Coin Offering Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a revolutionary AI agent coin that’s set to alter the fate of many small crypto traders like you and me.  It’s a self-evolving and autonomous AI-powered entity that lives on dApps and online platforms like X, chatting with crypto enthusiasts, influencers, and communities and understanding the ‘word on the street.’ Next, it uses next-gen hive-mind analysis to cut through all the clutter and come up with crypto investment opportunities that can actually yield profits. $MIND token holders will not only get exclusive access to such early-stage, high-potential trading calls, but they’ll also benefit from early access to the top new cryptos, i.e., even before they’re made available to the general public. The MIND of Pepe presale has already garnered over $5.5M, and it’s currently offering 1 $MIND for $0.0032924. However, the price will increase in the next few hours, so interested investors should hurry up. Check out how to buy $MIND for more info. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – A Less Risky Approach to Investing in Meme Coins If you’re on the ropes about investing directly into individual meme coins and would like something safer, Meme Index ($MEMEX) is exactly what you’re looking for.  This one-of-a-kind crypto offers four different baskets of meme coins, providing investors with the diversity to curate an investment strategy that’s perfectly aligned with their risk tolerance and psychology. $MEMEX’s baskets range from very safe ones like the Meme Titan Index that contain only well-established cryptos with a market cap of over $1B all the way to risky but exponentially rewarding baskets like the Meme Frenzy Index, which is made up of the top trending cryptos that could skyrocket soon. With the memecoin market destined for long-term growth, Meme Index could very well be among the biggest gainers, seeing as it allows every single type of investor to become a participant. The $MEMEX presale has over $3.4M in its kitty at the time of writing, and you can be a token holder for just $$0.0159713. For more info, here’s a guide on  how to buy $MEMEX. 4. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Biggest Crypto Presale Set to Offer Massive Gains Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is hands down the best crypto presale of all time. It has crossed the mighty Pepe Unchained by collecting a record amount of $70M+ within a relatively short period of time. The hype is real. $WEPE aims to sweep the floor with crypto whales and level the playing field for small investors like you and me. This Robin Hood-like mission has been the project’s biggest selling point. As a $WEPE token holder, you’ll receive unique market insights (including insider info), investment calls and strategies, and access to a thriving community of traders who will share their secrets, mutually benefitting from each other and ultimately abolishing the dominance of institutional investors. The $WEPE presale will end any moment now, so this is your last chance to join the frog army at a low price of just $0.0003665 per token. Here’s how to buy $WEPE. 5. Bonk ($BONK) – OG Dog Meme Coin to Get a Boost with Solana ETF Bonk was the first-ever dog-themed meme coin to be launched on Solana, rivaling the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu right from day one. It had a fantastic debut on Christmas Day 2022 when it airdropped a mind-boggling 50% of its total supply of 100 trillion coins to Solana community members who contributed to its creation. This wasn’t just a marketing move, either. $BONK really aims to become the community coin of Solana and challenge the very existence of predatory VC tokens. Although it was in red territory until very recently, $BONK looks like a really good buy right now.  It’s up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours, which could only be the beginning of a long rally upwards, as it stands to benefit massively from the launch of Solana ETFs. 6. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – NFT-Meme Coin Combination on Solana Pudgy Penguins is another Solana-based meme coin, which is why it, too, reacted positively to the possibility of Solana ETFs becoming a reality. It’s up by around 3% today. It’s worth noting that $PENGU first launched on Ethereum (back in 2021). However, it rose to fame only when it shifted to Solana last year, attracting new investors and building a vibrant community. Pudgy Penguins is based on an NFT collection by the same name. It’s a cutesy assortment of 8,888 penguin-themed cartoon characters, meaning the token now derives its value from community support and cultural significance. Moreover, a current price of just $0.03 also makes Pudgy Penguins one of the best cryptos under $1. Conclusion Although the above-mentioned meme coins are highly likely to shoot up because of the launch of a Solana ETF, that’s not to say you shouldn’t follow a healthy investment plan. Always invest an amount you’re comfortable losing and do your own research before investing.

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Reddit,solana,"How is literally 99/100 coins, especially those on the latest list of DEX aggregators with >200k liquidity, almost always rugs?",2025-02-09 19:50:48,"I’ve been in this space for a while now, and I’m honestly just feeling so done. Every time I see a coin on the 'newest' list of DEX aggregators, especially those with over 500k liquidity and a volume of more than a million, I get this glimmer of hope like “Hey, maybe this is the one.” But no, it’s always the same damn story.

Somewhere between the first pump and the second dip, everything collapses. I can’t even tell you how many coins I’ve lost on that looked so promising at first, with huge liquidity, high volume, buying pressure, even distribution and low whales, and all the right hype. Yet somehow, they still find a way to rug. The liquidity disappears, the price crashes so fast you can’t even get out in time, and suddenly, you’re left holding nothing.

I’ve seen people talk about how “this coin is different”, but deep down, I know. I KNOW it’s going to rug, just like every other one. The cycle feels endless, and I’m honestly just tired of losing. I can’t even trust the DEX lists anymore. 

Every time I try to find something decent, it just turns into another scam. I just don’t get it—99/100 times, how are scams SO common now? Is there any real hope of finding a gem, or are we all just destined to keep getting wrecked by these scams?

Sorry if I'm too dramatic, but this was the 4th time I got rugged today. I lost 34% of my balance in just one day.

The time taken includes the time taken to receive the tx confirmation using the signatureSubscribe rpc method. Helius won here by ~148k nanoseconds which equates to .148 seconds.

This cycle showed me that u can have all the money in the world and still be a cringe beta male. 

I never been envious or jealous of someone who has more . The way i think if u got more im tryna be ur friend ; learn from u and use u as motivation . 

But these type of people . I dont wanna be near u with a 16 foot pole. 

U have to really guard ur energy from this culture.

Before i got into solana trenches i was running 6-10 miles, waking up at 5am, fasting , not doing any drugs but coffee . 

Next thing u know im staying up all night, eating fast food, not working out as much, and picked up a nicotine habit. …. Of course i am the only person to blame. 

Im finally back to my old habits but it was hard . U dont realize how the culture is changing ur mental

Reddit,solana,Solana bots are printing money… but who’s actually making the profits?,2025-02-08 21:55:38,"Alright, I need to talk about this because it’s been driving me mad. If you’ve been in the Solana ecosystem for a while, you’ve probably seen those insane bot transactions flying across mempools sniping, MEV strategies, sandwiching, arbitrage. Feels like every day, there’s some fresh “bot made $X million in Y minutes” headline. But here’s the real question: who’s actually making this money? Because it sure as hell isn’t me.

I tried running my own bot a while back as thought I was about to print cash like everyone else. Spoiler: I got absolutely wrecked))) Between failed transactions, frontrunning, and just straight-up coding errors, I basically paid Solana validators for the privilege of losing money. Meanwhile, the big boys with deep pockets and optimized code are feasting. Even the simplest sniper bots need constant tweaking to stay ahead, and if you’re slow by even half a second, forget it) someone else already ate your lunch.

At this point, I’m convinced that unless you’re a dev with insane experience (or sitting on a pile of SOL to absorb failed trades), trying to DIY this stuff is just a donation to the network. Lately, I’ve been messing with Bananagun Bot as it just copies profitable traders automatically through Telegram, so at least I don’t feel like I’m getting dunked on by algo nerds 24/7. Not saying it’s magic, but it’s definitely better than my own attempts at playing bot wars, lol. 

What do you think of these ""bot"" trends? Has anyone here actually managed to build a consistently profitable bot from scratch, or is the real money just in copying the ones that already work? Are we just providing exit liquidity for the whales who already cracked the system?",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

NOVA bot recently released thier chrome plug in allowing nove to be used through the bullx neo platform.

Speed and fees are unrivaled. Paying nova fees and trading off bullx neo is amazing.

Right after this they were mass reported and at the same time sniperoo shills came out of the wood works. I'm assuming a lot of these shills from looking at thier reddit are just in it for refferal codes as the majority of them do not seem like successful traders and have no idea what they are really talking about.

I'm no genius. I make a living trading mostly worthless shit coins. My brain is probably fried from staring at dumb memes all day so maybe just maybe my thought process is out of wack here. But after the DWT fiasco and other bots who have rugged and shilled the same exact way sniperoo is doing with these refferals and spamming ads.

Really it comes down to why use an inferior bot. My back up bot is trojan or bonk after NOVA. Sniperoo literally isn't even on the list anymore. Wouldn't use it if all other bots crashed and I had no way to trade. Especially after thier horrible shilling marketing.

No I'm not a nova bot shill. My reddit is organic and I don't have refferal codes for any bots anywhere on my reddit or comments.

\- it checks the token using the solana sniffer API to determine the potential risk level

\- after a certain % of profit it sells the token

Problems i find with this:

\- speed - i probably need to spend a 1-2k extra for this bot to be among the fast ones when purchasing coins

\- i wanted to add a part where it checks the social buzz and mentions of the token to give me an idea it if is something community backed, but the twitter API could be a problem there as i want this token check to run every minute

Reddit,solana,Best Platform To Launch On?,2025-02-08 05:37:16,"Hi All!

Currently I am seeing 3 options to launch a Solana token (outside of doing the whole kit and caboodle myself on something like createmytoken etc); and I'd love some feedback from those with exp on which platform is ""better"". \*I put better in quotes because I know none of these are perfect and launching Sol memes is pretty much a trip to vegas to play ""watch the snipers"" slots - so need for that type of commentary please lol\*

1. [Pump.Fun](http://pump.fun/) \- obviously cheap, fast, huge following, pays .5 sol ""IF"" you migrate. Main question here which I can't get a straight answer on is: do they pay the .5 sol if the ""Dev""/creator also makes an initial purchase at launch? Some say yes some say no. Biggest con imo - is its rep for being scam city (well deserved) and the likelihood that I'd get rugged by snipers off the bat lol. But - the community is huge and thats helpful for a newer token who hasnt established much of a following yet. Also, I'm just kind of leary of the lawsuits popping up.
2. Moonshot (via Dexscreener) - cheap, but does have deployment fee, comes with enhanced Dex listing ($295 savings), and if i were to select raydium - pays 2 sol ""IF"" token migrates. Question here is also the same as above; is the 2 sol paid if the creator makes the initial purchase or is it only if the creator does NOT make the initial purchase? Can't tell from the docs. Also, if the creator makes the initial purchase is this considered ""liquidity"" and locked/burned or is it treated as a normal transaction that can be traded as per usual? Obvious con; community is smaller, don't see many tokens migrating from Moonshot and I've ""heard"" most will climb to just above bonding then Dump - speculation seems to be its an inside job with Moonshot /Dex.
3. A newer one - I've found ""GoFundMemes"" - super new, Ui looks janky, but I like that you can raise as little or as much you want prior to migration. They also seem to have a version that allows you to create your own tokenomics and vesting schedules. But again it looks like it showed up like a week or so ago and I don't know anybody who has launched on it .... so there's that

Any feedback would be appreciated (given its on topic and not to tell me to not bother wasting my time launching a token on Solana lol)

Reddit,solana,"Why Liquid Staking is Better Than Staking on Centralized Exchanges (and Why You Should Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase)",2025-02-06 22:52:53,"Hey,  
I have been seeing a lot of questions about staking lately, especially around liquid staking vs. staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, or Bybit. I wanted to share my thoughts on why liquid staking is the better move and why you should avoid staking SOL on Binance (bSOL), Bybit, or even Coinbase.

**1. Liquid Staking Gives You Flexibility**  
When you stake SOL through liquid staking protocols (like Marinade, Lido, The Vault or Jito), you get a liquid staked token (e.g., mSOL, stSOL, or jitoSOL, vSOL) in return. This means you can still use your staked SOL in DeFi..lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity while earning staking rewards. It’s the best of both worlds: you’re securing the network and earning yield, but you’re not locked out of using your funds.

With centralized exchanges, your SOL is locked up. You can’t do anything with it until you unstake (which can take days). That’s a huge opportunity cost, especially in a fast-moving ecosystem like Solana where DeFi opportunities are everywhere.

**2. Decentralization Matters**  
Staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase means they control the validators. This centralizes power and goes against the whole ethos of crypto. Solana is all about decentralization, and by staking with independent validators (or through liquid staking protocols that delegate to them), you’re helping keep the network secure and decentralized.

**3. The Vault Supports Decentralization by Delegating to Community-Driven Validators**  
One thing I love about liquid staking protocols like The Vault is that they actively support decentralization. For example, The Vault delegates to validators that are actively involved in the Solana community. These validators aren’t just big players with massive stakes, they’re smaller, community-driven operators who contribute to the ecosystem. By staking through The Vault, you’re not just earning rewards; you’re helping grow a more decentralized and resilient network.

**4. Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase**  
This is where it gets sketchy. Binance’s bSOL and Bybit’s staked SOL are essentially IOU tokens. You’re not actually staking on the Solana network, you’re trusting Binance or Bybit to do it for you. This adds unnecessary counterparty risk. What happens if Binance or Bybit gets hacked, goes down, or decides to freeze withdrawals? You’re stuck.

Coinbase isn’t much better. I used to stake my SOL on Coinbase because it was “easy,” but I quickly realized I was getting a lower APY compared to liquid staking or even direct staking. Plus, Coinbase takes a (35%) cut of your rewards, so you’re leaving money on the table. And just like Binance and Bybit, you’re trusting a centralized entity with your funds. If Coinbase has issues (like they did during the SEC lawsuit), your staked SOL could be at risk.

**5. Better Yields with Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking protocols often offer competitive APYs, and you can boost your returns even further by using your liquid staked tokens in DeFi. For example, you can deposit vSOL or jitoSOL into a lending platform or LP pool and stack yields. Centralized exchanges can’t compete with that.  


I used to stake on Coinbase because it felt “safe” and familiar, but once I learned more about how staking works and the risks of centralized exchanges, I switched to liquid staking. Now I use The Vault, and it’s been a game-changer. Not only am I earning better yields, but I can also use my vSOL in DeFi to maximize my returns. Plus, knowing that my stake is supporting community-driven validators through The Vault makes me feel like I’m actually contributing to Solana’s growth. It’s a no-brainer once you understand the benefits.

What do you guys think? Anyone else make the switch from CEX staking to liquid staking? ",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

* crypto pumps - only working for the organizers, everybody else is the exit liquidity
* telegram groups where you send $500, they trade it for you, and in 2 days you get back $5000
* many bots and wallet drainers
* [coinfast.fun](http://coinfast.fun) rugpulls
* $50 to $50k challenges on twitter (some could be legit) but when you comment on one immediately you will get a bunch of similar accounts writing you messages to set up a bot that will of course send the money to them
* crypto call groups - most of them are just people randomly selecting coins and promoting them, with 80% of them ending in a rugpull minutes after the call
* shady exchanges that dont allow you to withdraw the money

I recently looked into the LPs on Raydium for the first time and used Metrix Finance to sim a few positions. The experience I've had before with LPs was from Pancake Swap previously.

Simming the position of SOL-RAY on Metrix shows that if you were to put down $10k based on a reasonable exposure percentage you're looking at about 100% APR give or take across 90 days. 

Is it me or do these seem to be too good to be true? You're looking at a full return within 9 months if compounding.

Reddit,ethereum,Cheaper gas fees alone won't save ethereum. Innovation will.,2025-02-07 19:16:15,"Hey everyone, 

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,ethereum,Which web/online wallet allows you to put name labels?,2025-02-07 01:00:03,"I have a need to personalize the ethereum address (via a screenshot) to make it clear to corporate purposes and the tax authority of my country of residence for accounting purposes. This is important to reflect the essence of the operation, for example, there was a movement of an ETH between an individual and his own legal entity, but not the sale of capital. 

In other words, I want to go through some service like Myetherwallet into my wallet and put my full name next to the address, as well as with the opportunity to show in the service itself a transaction originating in the past, and regarding it, so that the screen shows that the wallet belongs to me. Ideally, if you can save the recipient’s address under a different name and this is added as part of a specific operation (personal - corporate)

We are not talking about public coverage of the owner on the blockchain through signed transactions, without compromising the loss of anonymization of the owner!

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Reddit,ethereum,🚀 Major Update: Wanchain’s ETH XFlows Now Integrated with Polygon zkEVM! 🚀,2025-02-03 14:56:23,"https://preview.redd.it/mnxzuga2uxge1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=930d2fb712a78a211091fca9262c13d3acd8fdb9

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

The challenge is that I only have the recipient's **Ethereum address**, but encryption typically requires their **public key**.

Since Ethereum addresses are derived from the public key but don’t expose it directly, I’m looking for the best approach to encrypt data for a recipient without having their full public key beforehand.

How to tackel this any idea??

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Time to invest in Bitcoin all the money you cannot afford to lose…,2025-02-09 11:29:44,"At least for me this has been reality for the last 6,5 years. As I sport a job where I cannot gain a pension (too long to explain - but since I don’t work in the country of my citizenship - i am not entitled to any pension even if I decide to go back home in the future). Hence, after the 40s I started to think seriously about my retirement plans. I of course tried stock picking, dividend growth investing and all the rest - till I decided to make Bitcoin my pensjon scheme. Beside a few MSTR shares - I don’t hold anything else than btc in cold storage. If I lose my money - I am truly in the worse space possible so what I saved so far are the money that I CANNOT afford to lose.
A company stock can crash, an house can burn, a business can fail, a good bar can be stolen… also bitcoin needs security - this is why I cold storage with passphrase - but I have the feeling that it will be the fastest horse in the race and the risk to hold bitcoin is lower than anything else.

I cannot afford to lose my retirement.
This is why 99% of my savings are in the best bank in cyberspace - Bitcoin. Because in Bitcoin I have all the money I cannot afford to lose.

Happy stacking to everybody. ",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,bitcoin,"My BTC buying ""feeless"" strategy",2025-02-09 18:45:25,"Let me start by saying that I’m a bit of a cheap-o, I don’t like spending money unnecessarily and am always on the lookout for ways to save, even if it’s just a penny here and there. With that in mind, here’s my strategy for buying Bitcoin without ""feeling"" it.

I have two [free] credit cards:

1. A card called Plata that gives me 1% cashback on every purchase.
2. Another card called Nu that comes with a savings account offering 12.5% annual interest on the balance.

Here’s how it works:
- Whenever I make a purchase, I use the Plata card to earn cashback.
- I then round up the purchase amount and transfer the rounded-up amount from my bank account to the Nu card. For example, if I buy something for $53, I might round up to $55 or $60 and transfer that whole amount to Nu, where it earns interest daily.

The reason for rounding up is twofold:
1. It helps me slowly build up the balance in Nu, even if I haven’t made many purchases that month. The higher the balance, the more interest I get.
2. It ensures I have enough in Nu to meet the minimum transfer requirement those months I really cheaped out and didn't use the card much. 

At the end of the month, when the Plata statement comes in (minus the cashback), I pay it off using the balance from Nu. Any leftover money in Nu is what I use to buy Bitcoin (which is essentially the cashback from Plata, plus my roundups, plus the interest earned in Nu).

The key is that I don’t have to make a separate transfer from my bank account specifically to buy Bitcoin, which makes it feel more seamless, and less painful psychologically. For a cheap-o like me, this is a way to stack sats without ""feeling it."" Thought I'd share it in case there are other cheap-o's like me out there.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,bitcoin,The 7th Circle of Hell- Coinbase Account Locked Out After Yubikey Removed,2025-02-09 21:33:36,"We've had a Coinbase account setup for my daughter with Bitcoin in it.

Last month, this account had 2FA Text messaging for security. It always worked. 

But for extra security,  We added a Yubikey as a more secure option using the desktop version of Coinbase (CB).

We noticed that the Coinbase app  under Yubikey was not compatible with her iPhone SE for some buggy reason.

I suggested we login via the desktop version of Coinbase and remove the Yubikey. I thought this would allow the Coinbase app to work better.  It was a huge disaster due to poor coding in Co8nbase.

The Coinbase Help page specifically states you can change your 2FA options once you are logged into your account.  THIS IS FALSE. IT DOES NOT ALLOW THIS.

Instead, it seems we should have ADDED the Text 2FA option back in BEFORE removing the Yubikey.  Because we have now entered the Coinbase 7th Circle of Hell.

Immediately after deleting the Yubikey 2FA key as a 2FA option, my daughter's account switched to the next most secure method.  IT switched on its own to Google Authenticator.

CLEARLY, THIS IS A BUG.  IT DEFIES THEIR OWN HELP INSTRUCTIONS.  

As we have never had this account setup with Google Authenticator for 2aFA on my daughter's phone, we are now locked out of our account the second we sign out on our desktop.  

Any attempt to add an alternate 2FA method, such as reverting back to Text SMS messages leads to a dialog box requesting a 6 Digit Authenticator code.  A code we cant generate since we never used Authenticator on this account.

The other option: ""Try Another Way"" pops up the link to RECOVER Your Account, which is a nightmarish multi-day process at a minimum.  We have entered the Coinbase 7th Circle of Hell, metely by removing our Yubikey while inside our account at the 2FA Settings screen.  This makes no sense.

We once spent an entire week in this 7th Circle of Hell because my daughter's account was inactive for 9 months.

My blood pressure hit a new record high today.  We're pulling all the tex statements and CSV files off the account.  It's nearly tax time and we dont know how long this nightmare will last.

I am poating this to watn others not to make this mistake.

And really, there's a design flaw here.

But here’s a thought: as Bitcoin matures and institutional players pile in, are we at risk of losing that original revolutionary spark?

I ask because the idea of having no capital gains tax on Bitcoin sales at all seems unlikely to happen. The government will always want their cut of the action.

Reddit,bitcoin,What is your CODE RED process?,2025-02-09 12:48:16,"Hi all,

I see comments on here often regarding what people do incase their seedphrase gets compromised. For example, dummy wallets with small amounts, having 2 cold storages that you can jump between, passphrases etc. I just wanted to know the specifics of what your process would be if there was a code red and your seed phrase was compromised, or your device was stolen/lost.

(1) So for example, let's say you're storing your seedphrase not buried underground or in a secure safe, just in your house somewhere. You're on holiday and you get a message from your neighbour that your house has been burgled. What would you do? Do you keep wallet addresses on you at all times and quickly transfer everything out to another place? Like another wallet? Or even an exchange temporarily?

I'd just like to know exactly what you guys have in place incase something like that happened. I have a cold wallet so have a basic understand of how that all works. But if I suddenly found out my seedphrase was compromised, or my device was stolen, I wouldn't really know the quickest way to rectify that.

(2) Also, I've had a Ledger for a while. I bought it like 4 years ago and at the time didn't do my research properly. But I've swapped to a Trezor now. How would you utilise that Ledger wallet now? I've seen comments about using another/old wallet as the middle man, and keep the new Trezor as offline as possible. So say, Coinbase > Ledger > Trezor. Keep the transactions to and from exchanges off the Trezor, and as offline as possible.

So with that theory, you'd have the Trezor wallet address written down somewhere? Would it be safe to have on your phone notes? To be used in option (1) and also option (2).

Sorry a lot to unpack there. But just wanted to know what you guys reckon.

I'm just holding Bitcoin now. And have 2 wallets. Trezor Safe 3 (BTC only) and the original Ledger Nano X. So two wallets now, but seeing as I still have that working Ledger, just wondered what the best way would be to utilise the two (if at all).",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,bitcoin,Does AGI threaten Bitcoin and the entire monetary system?,2025-02-09 18:00:11,"I want to start by saying that I truly believe Bitcoin is the ultimate form of money. In our current monetary system, I think it will eventually surpass every other asset class.

Over the past five years, I’ve spent a considerable amount of time thinking through all the possible scenarios in which Bitcoin could hypothetically fail or stop growing. In my opinion, there is only one real threat in the near future—not just to Bitcoin but to our entire monetary system—and that is the potential creation of artificial general intelligence.

If a cheap enough AGI would be created, that would mean that a possible super intelligence would follow soon after.

The emergence of such super intelligence would mean that all human labor would become basically worthless. And I don't even want to get into the obvious alignment problem.

I know it is not set in stone that this will be possible in our near future, because the current LLM based systems make a lot of mistakes in the form of hallucinating facts. However, I believe the potential is significant enough that we should at least be cautious.

What do you guys think of this possibility? I know its a bit of a who the fuck knows, but I’ve noticed that this uncertainty has made me more reluctant to save money in Bitcoin. Instead, I find myself spending it on things I enjoy, simply because the future feels so unpredictable. :)

Reddit,bitcoin,Why capital gains tax is pure theft,2025-02-07 17:53:11,"Say you have $100,000 you want to protect from inflation. 

You buy an asset (Bitcoin, Gold, Real-estate).

In 5 years, your asset is worth $250,000.

You sell and must pay capital gains taxes on $150,000 (at 20% that would be $30,000 in tax).

But over those 5 years, the government printed 10% new money each year, which devalued your dollars by 37.9%.

That means they already taxed you on your wealth each year, so why are you also paying a ""capital gain"" on the sale?

So the calculation should be:

$250,000 - 37.9% depreciation - $100,000 initial investment

Your actual gain was only $93,150 after depreciation.

But you're being asked to pay 20% on the total $150,000 instead of on the actual inflation adjusted gains.

And even worse, the inflation numbers they publish are fake to make them seem better than reality actually is, so you can't even calculate an accurate depreciation over time (more accurate to use real estate prices to see depreciation rate).

So why the fuck do we allow them to charge us capital gains tax, when we are ALREADY TAXED EVERY YEAR by the MONEY PRINTING??

Complete bullshit.

Reddit,bitcoin,Is Passive Bitcoin Mining with Ember Worth It?,2025-02-09 20:11:09,"💡 **Has anyone here tried mining Bitcoin without hardware?** I recently came across an app that lets you collect satoshis daily with almost no effort. You just open the app **once a day**, tap a button, and it farms satoshis **every hour**.

📱 **How does it work?**

* No hardware or investment needed
* Runs in the background without battery drain
* Passive BTC accumulation over time

🎯 **What’s the catch?**  
Of course, it’s not actual mining like running an ASIC, and the rewards are small. But I’m curious – **has anyone else tested similar apps?** Are they worth it long-term?

Technically, The economy doesn't ""need"" Bitcoin to run itself. 

Something like oil which is used to fuel the majority of... well.. basically everything, makes sense to hold as a reserve since it has almost unlimited use case. 

Even to the argument if the dollar crashes and all hell breaks loose. You'd think that BTC would take over. But say it's to the point where the internet is basically non existent. How can Bitcoin be used? At that point again oil would be the most important thing to have as a reserve.  

These are wild hypnoticals, but what's the argument for the reserve when technically, the economy doesnt need Bitcoin to run. Isn't a strategic reserve suppose to be something that is crucial to have incase of national emergencies?

But apparently he doesn't see an issue with 20-25% of supply (lost wallets) being taken by quantum computing.  

That's quite the rosy take on it.  I'd imagine smart money would exit ahead of this for 3 reasons.    
  
Potential panic as wallets ""wake up"" at an alarming rate.    
Potential panic at what the price impact could be.    
Potential panic of people worrying others will panic.

  
I actually think there is a much better approach - that I've written about before.    
  
I was told it was a bad idea.  My guess is people either didn't get it, or didn't like the idea that quantum computing requires solutions, starting now to properly be ready without disruption.

This certainly is not a narrative, it isn't FUD.    
  
The biggest players in the world recognize it- and that includes the CEO of Tether.

Let's stop trying to spin it, ignore it, or assume it will be managed.  The time to deal with it is now.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I made an Open source tool to help you backtest your trading or investment strategy,2025-02-09 13:37:41,"Backtesting a strategy means applying it to a historical dataset and seeing how it would have performed on past data. The results should then determine if this is a potentially viable strategy to start live trading/investing with, or whether it needs some more fine-tuning.

The problem with backtesting strategies is that it usually requires you to pretty much re-write your backtesting algorithm because each strategy needs to be configured to act in a specific way. To get around this issue, I made a simple tool that allows you to easily create plug-and-play strategies and slot them into the Backtester.

The tool is written in Python and uses the Backtester py library to handle backtesting and reporting. Because it's modular it's very easy to code a strategy and test it. For instance, here's how you'd go about coding a Buy The Dip strategy:

    class BuyTheDip(Strategy):
        def init(self):
            pass
    
        def next(self):
            current_close = self.data.Close[-1]  # Current candle's close
            previous_close = self.data.Close[-2]  # Previous candle's close
            price_difference = (current_close - previous_close) / previous_close * 100
    
            if price_difference <= -5:
                self.buy(
                    size=0.1, sl=stop_loss * current_close, tp=take_profit * current_close
                )
                print(
                    f""Bought at {current_close}, which is a {price_difference}% from previous close ({previous_close})""
                )
            else:
                print(f""Did not buy, price difference is only {price_difference}%"")

Here, we want to buy Bitcoin every time the price drops by more than 5% compared to the previous candle close.  
Running the strategy will output its performance like so:

https://preview.redd.it/itzhrks3o3ie1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=191567e62b2d5271c929805c05141aed28e944e6

Buy and Hold Return%, Return %, Win Rate and Profit Factor are metrics you need to look out for. 

* Buy and Hold return tells us whether it's more advantageous to simply buy and hold rather than trade over that specific period
* Return % is the amount of profit made trading
* Win Rate is a percentage showing how many of our trades are profitable. As you can see buying dips and selling them at a 5% take profit gives us a 90% profitability rate.
* Profit Factor represents the gross profit divided by the gross loss

The backtester will also plot the performance, showing you the entry and exit positions on a candlestick chart.

https://preview.redd.it/hjvf15c1o3ie1.png?width=3771&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff61f16011326f21560cb4bcc4e59f4e89d5aed1

In my example, I used CoinGecko API to fetch historical data, but you may use any data source you wish, as long as you feed it candlestick data.

I started coinbase a month ago, and have lost about 2 grands.

I clicked on 'all' or '1Y' tab, since I only joined a month ago, I expect the numbers to be exactly the same - but in fact it showed more unrealized return on 1Y tab (1k++) vs All tab (800++ as you can see in screenshot).

Also, I have actually lost 2 grands - I have done a few trades, was down like 5 grands or something initially but managed to close the gap a little.

Do they just sell? Nope.

Notice where it bottoms out. Right around their original buy price; 22.368$.

This is just one of their sub-accounts. It \*only\* holds6 MM of Hype. God knows what their other addresses hold.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Learning charts & the effectiveness of charts,2025-02-09 19:00:50,"So I’m relatively new to crypto and I’m trying to consume as much knowledge as possible. I wanted to start learning the basics of charting (is this what it’s typically called)? I found some tutorials and videos on YouTube. Is there any YouTube or reading that would serve as a great into to charting? Or like a known go-to for beginners.

Also, are there any go-to books on crypto’s origins and purposes. Currently reading “Digital Gold” and enjoying it.


On top of this, I was wondering how effective charting is? Do the same patterns identified in stocks present themselves in crypto? And do these patterns occur because as humans our decisions en masse seem to follow patterns and repeat? Sort of charting as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin's mempool cleared for first time since Jan 2023, sparking concerns of long-term security budget sustainability",2025-02-08 19:08:12,"**TL;DR**:

Last week, Bitcoin's mempool dropped to 0 vBytes, making it the first time this happened since Jan 2023. It means there is little demand for on-chain Bitcoin transactions.

On the positive side, Bitcoin fees are at the lowest they've been in years. On the negative side, this usually only happens during **bear markets**, and it shows that Bitcoin's **security budget is not sustainable** when the block subsidy is gone. Mining revenue collapses 10-100x whenever this happens, and revenue becomes extremely unstable.

For the past 2 years, Ordinals and Inscriptions have dominated activity, giving hope that Bitcoin's security budget could be sustained in the long run after the block subsidy programmatically collapse. But even Ordinals activity has dropped considerably recently as people flee away from memecoins.

> Overall, the mempool clearing coupled with transaction fees being stagnant is a reminder that Bitcoin mining needs Bitcoin to evolve into a robust platform for mining to remain a profitable business.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Trouble using WhatToMine for hobby mining,2025-02-09 12:16:31,"I have a halfway decent rig (5950x and 6900xt) at home that's unused as I'm out of the country long term. I was thinking of repurposing it to try mining some altcoins. I'm not expecting to get rich, but it would be cool to make a little profit after electricity costs, and most importantly I think I'd enjoy it as a hobby. I can SSH in while I'm away and tweak it easily too.

I was using ChatGPT (4o) to do some calculations, and was pretty thrilled to see I could make a few $ mining KAS and ERG. I then found the site WhatToMine, but I think I'm doing something wrong. 

It's showing net profit in the negative for every coin. I tried putting in a 4090 instead of my 6900xt, same thing. At $0.14/kWh, the best I can do apparently is ALEO, losing -$0.01. I did notice that it doesn't seem to include a lot of altcoins, but it does have ERG, claiming a -$0.91 loss. ChatGPT spits out this:

""The **daily net profit** for a **6900 XT mining Ergo (ERG)** at **$0.14/kWh** is approximately **$3.56/day**.​""

Am I overlooking anything in WhatToMine, or should I just move on to another hobby (even if I went out and bought 2x4090's, which apparently will lose money too)?

If it helps, here's how I have it set up currently (6900xt + 4090 as I was thinking of getting a 4090):

I could go for the much cheaper “altcoins”, like PEPE, but that’s more volatile and risky, and $100 still won’t make me that much of it it goes from $0.000010 to $0.000020.

If you don’t have a degree, or a driver’s license, it’s even harder to get a better job in the immediate term, especially if it’s remote.

I’m not even asking for get rich quick methods (but wouldn’t hesitate if it was likely, I’m getting more desperate).

You simply have to keep enduring suffering, whether that be in an abusive household, or homeless. There’s no quick way out, and in bad living circumstances it’s harder to build to anything longterm either.

Finally, because this is our last announcement about the State of Crypto Survey, we want to especially thank the Mods for allowing us to post our study in this group. Without the support of this community so central to crypto our outreach would have been much more limited and our research would end up less impactful.

We are looking forward to disclose our first results in this group (before anywhere else) probably in one month time. Scientific publications will take much longer, several months or even a year, but we will post updates about those as well.

As usual, if you have any questions or feedback, do not hesitate to get in contact.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fees Drop Below 1 Gwei ($0.06): Low Fees, High Usage, Great Success",2025-02-07 18:21:24,"I have just crossed with the following [Tweet](https://x.com/DegenerateNews/status/1887644418947027287) that made me realize how Ethereum upgrades are really proving that they are a big success.

[Ethereum Gwei](https://preview.redd.it/bcpwxibntnhe1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d50dc776860b7d41df01eb0d114209a2c8ae94)

As you can see in the image above Gwei is currently at 0.986 ($0.06) at High priority which is really cheap comparing with what we have seen in the past before. If you have been here for a long time you will understand, I suggest you to search your wallet address on Etherscan, click on Analytics tab and then on TxnFees tab to enjoy watching how much you paid on ETH gas fees in the past xD

This low fees made me think that Ethereum transactions have decreased and are low right now so I decided to check it but I am quite surprised.

[Ethereum Daily Transactions Chart](https://preview.redd.it/30fsohvvunhe1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=402d75dcea5443010e57c6313ed2eaaec6cb2a47)

As you can see in the chart above Ethereum daily transactions are 2021 levels with 1,333,804 transactions yesterday. This confirms us that people are still using Ethereum actively even if the price is not in a great place. It also confirms us that all the upgrades released during this last years are working like a charm even if the inflation has raised a bit but I think that ""problem"" will be solved soon with some changes that are coming. Its also great to see how L2s are also working as expected in the whole Ethereum scalability roadmap absorbing traffic and reducing congestion on L1.

This is bullish because it makes Ethereum competitive with other alternative chains, it is not suffering from low demand and keeps evolving.

	•	OpenAIs Pro subscription costs €200/month, so I’d need a few people to contribute a small amount to cover the cost.
	•	It can analyze tokenomics, historical performance, developer activity, regulatory risks, and community sentiment all in one structured report.
	•	The AI ranks high on research benchmarks and might offer a unique perspective on a project’s potential.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Crypto: A Glorified Storage of Nothing,2025-02-09 12:13:33,"Cryptocurrencies (crypto) are often portrayed as revolutionary decentralized systems, but the truth is that they are just online storage systems securing units of nothing. Crypto wallets display numbers, making it seem like users own a certain amount of something. But the reality is that those numbers represent nothing. People may call it an asset, a coin, money, value, digital gold, or digital property, but in the end, all they have are numbers calculated by the systems and assigned to their addresses. Then, using wallet apps, they transfer these numbers to other addresses. And that’s it. It’s just the reassignment of units of nothing. Crypto holders cannot prove they own anything real in the amount of assigned numbers, nothing that exists or functions outside of that reassignment process.

Now, let’s consider what it means to actually hold units of something. When people hold stocks, they own units of an actual company, with those units being used to receive profits, buybacks, or liquidation value. When they hold dollars, they own units of an actual debt within the U.S. banking system, with the units being used by debtors to redeem that debt. When they hold digital audio or video files, they own units of an actual good that is used for entertainment. When they hold gold, they own units of an actual metal that is used in electronics, jewelry, and industry. And when they hold art or sports cards, they own units of an actual resource used for aesthetic, historical, or cultural purposes.

But in the case of crypto, no one can point to something and show its use for a specific purpose. That’s because holding crypto means holding units of nothing. Crypto holders claim to own a certain amount of something, yet they can never show anything that functions as in the above examples, where we had units of a company, debt, digital goods, or metal. If someone asks a crypto holder to prove what they truly own, the only response is an abstract term like ""coin,"" ""digital gold,"" ""asset,"" ""value,"" or ""money."" But they cannot show a real, functional item that does something in the real world. This clearly proves that they hold units of nothing, which are merely sent back and forth within the system.

Despite this, crypto believers insist they own something. That’s what makes it both absurd and hilarious. Systems in which they hold no real ownership still convince them that they own valuable assets. But this isn’t just a flaw, it’s the entire foundation of crypto. It survives on belief, persuading people that the numbers assigned to their addresses represent ownership of something, even though they can never explain where that something is or what it actually does.

Crypto is not an asset, money, a product, a resource, or a store of value because all of those are units of something real. Crypto is a digital illusion, an online storage system for units of nothing, while its ""transactions"" are not transfers of ownership but merely changes representing who currently holds the empty bags.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Metamask compromised?,2025-02-09 07:58:21,"I staked Sushi/Weth about 5 years ago on Sushiswap.  Once every 6 months to a year I would check it.  Unfortunately I missed the big spike in Sushi and did not sell.  But everytime I would log onto the site I had a bitch of a time locating my staked coins.  I should have approx. $1,000 to $1,500 but cannot find it.  I see the original transactions, but others more recent I cannot recognize.  I'm looking for my seed phrase to restore the wallet to a different browser.  Maybe someone else is better at reading these transactions than I am.  

Also, I was kicked off of Binance as a US trader about 4 years ago and sent my XRP into the wrong wallet.  It went to a Binance address in my Metamask wallet and was never able to retrieve it.  It was only about $.25 then but is now worth about $3.00 and around $4,000 now.  If anyone knows of a way to recover my coins I'd be ecstatic.  I cannot sent back to the original Binance address because they will not deal with US customers, so I hope my 4k is not lost.   

I used to be very good at these transactions, but have just let kind of ignored my wallet and let the funds sit.  I would never keep the funds on the exchange for any period of time, but they coins were staked.  I can't find them which is not unusual, but there are transactions I don't recognize.  I'll check back tomorrow and can hopefully find someone more knowledgeable.   Thanks in advance. ",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

  
Thanks! (:",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892
Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,finance,Oil & Gas Investment Banking Interview Prep,2015-01-07 20:43:30,"Looking for insights on how to prep for an oil & gas interview. I'm a Masters in Econ student and I just wrote CFA level 1 in December. Wondering what kinds of things to prepare for that wouldn't be covered by my background since I didn't do a Bcomm. Also looking for specifics on the oil & gas industry. I'm an avid investor and read market news daily, but I've never invested in oil and gas specifically and thus am inexperienced with the industry specifics. Reading as much as I can find on the internet right now through investopedia/WSO/mergers and inquisitions and grabbed the vault guide and book by Rosenbaum, but would love to hear some tidbits from those with experience on this sub. Thanks! (Position is in Calgary, Alberta)",2025-02-10 00:53:23.165892
