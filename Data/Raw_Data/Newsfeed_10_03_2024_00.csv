SEC Appeals Court Ruling On XRP The implications of this ruling are substantial. Judge Torres stated that the approximately $757 million in XRP sales on public exchanges did not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction, thereby exempting these transactions from the investor protection laws the agency enforces.  Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand If the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upholds this interpretation, it could hinder the SEC’s ability to regulate other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, and challenge the agency’s oversight of newer financial products that do not fit traditional definitions. However, the ruling was not entirely favorable for Ripple. Torres also ruled that roughly $728 million of XRP sales to institutional investors should be classified as securities, requiring compliance with relevant laws.  Ripple CEO Slams SEC’s Appeal The SEC had originally sought a hefty $2 billion fine against Ripple, but Torres ultimately imposed a $125 million penalty, which is currently on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In The ‘Final Test’, Here’s Where The BTC Price Is Headed Next Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his frustration at the SEC’s decision to appeal, calling it “misguided” and “infuriating.” He emphasized that despite the ongoing legal challenges, the current legal status of XRP as a non-security is established: If Gensler and the SEC were rational, they would have moved on from this case long ago. It certainly hasn’t protected investors and instead has damaged the credibility and reputation of the SEC. While we’ll fight in court for as long as we need, let’s be clear: XRP’s status as a non-security is the law of the land today. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5390, down 10% after the SEC appealed the judge’s ruling on Wednesday.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon,2024-10-02 23:30:12+00:00,"Hamster Kombat burst into the trading scene in September after a long-running airdrop farming event. Despite all of the hype leading up to the launch of the token, the airdrop did come out to be disappointing for investors, even though it listed at around a $500 million. Since then, the price has struggled against the bearish headwinds, losing around 43% of its value. However, this decline may be coming to an end according to one analyst, who sees a bullish future for the HMSTR token. Hamster Kombat Develops Bullish Indicators Given the current state of the Hamster Kombat token and the consistent decline, it seemed at first that this was a failed launch. However, crypto analyst Saeed Sheikh sees an opportunity where many sees losses. In an analysis posted on the TradingView website, Sheikh explained that the current indicators could actually be bullish for the Hamster Kombat price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Not Over: CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Where We Are This Cycle As the crypto analyst explains in the post, the decline in the Hamster Kombat price has pushed the altcoin into oversold territory. This explains the sharp decline in price over the last month. But it is also bullish for the price, especially a popular altcoin like Hamster Kombat. When an asset is in oversold territory, it often means that it is due for a recovery. This is because the sellers will have exhausted their stash and this leaves only the holders in charge. As a result, support is often established for the price, providing a bounce point for the next recovery. If this is the case and the Hamster Kombat sellers are nearing exhaustion as it enters oversold territory, then Hamster Kombat could be forming support somewhere around $0.005. In this case, this would be the bounce-off point for the next rally and recover its losses from September. Where Is The Price Headed? Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, the Hamster Kombat price could more than double from here if it plays out correctly. There are multiple major targets to hit and overcome as they carry the most resistance for the altcoin from here. Related Reading: Major Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To New ATH In Q4 Emerges The first target to hit is $0.009116 at the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Here is the first resistance, but arguably the most easiest to conquer from here. Next is the $0.011 target at the 0.236 Fibonacci level. Last but not least is the $0.014149 target, which is the strongest resistance. Naturally, as the price increases, so does the resistance from bears. Given the current position of the Hamster Kombat price at the time of this writing, hitting the very last target at $0.014149 would mean a more than 100% increase. However, this move is also largely dependent on how the Bitcoin price sways the crypto market, according to the crypto analyst.

He has recently done an analysis that shows the token is approaching a critical juncture. In the short term, prices may increase more than $1.50 if it can surpass the Genuine Wake-Up Line (GWUL). Related Reading: Could XRP See A 360% Surge By Christmas? Experts Think So Traders pay attention to the significant resistance levels of XRP since it displays the price pattern of the cryptocurrency. By the first of November in 2024, CoinCodex anticipates a 19.57% gain. This indicates that a significant number of market players believe the asset will increase in value. Resistance At The Genuine Wake-Up Line EGRAG recently released the GWUL following XRP’s successful passage of the Final Wake-Up Line, another key barrier. Since its formation following XRP’s high of $1.96 in April 2021, this new line has proved to be a formidable resistance. The analyst theorizes that XRP is now at the edge of breaking this level of resistance, meaning there could be a strong shift in market mood. Perhaps the token would start rallying towards $1.50 if it could close above the GWUL and manage to stay above after having breached above it. Mid-term projections are even more optimistic, with potential targets set between $5.50 and $7.50. #XRP Genuine Wake-Up Line (Micro Moves – Lower Time Frame) 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 🔍 A closer look at the borders of the GWUL (Genuine Wake-Up Line) reveals an intense battle ⚔️ between the #Bulls 🐂 and #Bears 🐻. The action is heating up, but guess what? The wave count is on our side!… https://t.co/RJoVyM8RiL pic.twitter.com/QcYFFQn0vl — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 1, 2024 EGRAG emphasizes that it is insufficient to simply barrel past the GWUL; XRP must maintain its position above this line for a minimum of three days. This confirmation is essential for the establishment of a favorable trend. At the moment, XRP is trading at approximately $0.58, which is why the next few days are so critical for its price movement. Patterns Suggest A Conflict Between Bears And Bulls On EGRAG’s chart, the GWUL and a yellow triangle indicate the trading conditions’ upper limit, with the Atlas Line supporting it. Within the larger yellow triangle, a smaller white triangle has also emerged, illustrating the ongoing market tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The stakes are high as XRP approaches the convergence point of these triangles. If investors are able to elevate XRP above this triangle, it could trigger a substantial bullish wave, thereby verifying the breach of the GWUL. Reaching the $1.50 threshold is particularly significant, as it would conclude Wave 1 of a more extensive Elliott Wave pattern, according to EGRAG. In the event that XRP surpasses this threshold, a corrective Wave 2 could occur, resulting in a decline to approximately $0.75 before a more substantive rally. This rally may ultimately result in the ambitious target of $7.50. Related Reading: Humor Or Sarcasm? Dogecoin Leaps 20%, Co-Creator Says He Doesn’t Know Why Monitoring Support Levels Although the outlook is still positive, there’s a caveat in that XRP has to remain trading above its key support at $0.62. XRP is trading just below this critical level of support now, so there is some concern about how long it might sustain its bull run. Markets are cautious while awaiting events. The rest of the week will show if XRP has promise. If it stays over $0.62, the token may spark a breakout. Featured image from SETI Institute, chart from TradingView",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand,2024-10-02 20:30:41+00:00,"SUI has experienced an impressive surge of over 160% since the start of September, with its price now hovering around $2. This remarkable rally has analysts and investors highly optimistic about the future of the layer-1 blockchain. Beyond its soaring price, SUI is showing strong growth across key metrics, signaling increasing adoption and usage. According to data from DefiLlama, SUI’s total value locked (TVL) has reached new all-time highs, indicating a robust demand for its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The rising TVL highlights a growing interest from users and developers, further boosting confidence in SUI’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Could Go Parabolic’ Once It Breaks $200 Resistance – Analyst The price surge is not just driven by market sentiment but is backed by tangible growth in the platform’s fundamentals. With both TVL and user engagement increasing, the positive outlook for SUI continues to build. Investors are now eyeing higher price targets as they anticipate further growth for the layer-1 blockchain in the coming weeks. As SUI pushes to higher levels, its performance reflects both strong market support and underlying network growth, making it one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space. SUI TVL Signals Ongoing Rally SUI is currently testing a crucial supply level around the $2 mark, a psychological barrier that, once surpassed, could pave the way for a surge to new highs. Analysts are watching this level closely, as breaking through it would likely trigger a strong bullish move. On-chain data from DefiLlama supports this optimism, revealing that SUI’s total value locked (TVL) has reached an all-time high of $1.07 billion. This marks a remarkable 65% increase in TVL over the past 30 days, signaling growing confidence in the platform’s utility and long-term potential. The rise in TVL is a net positive for the SUI coin, as it reflects the increasing adoption of the Sui ecosystem. As more value flows into the network, the demand for SUI tokens will likely grow, creating upward pressure on its price. Investors often view rising TVL as a bullish signal, suggesting that the platform is gaining traction and trust among users. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers If these positive trends in TVL and overall network activity continue, a rise above SUI’s previous all-time high of $2.16 seems likely in the coming weeks. With momentum building, many expect SUI to achieve further gains, reinforcing its position as a leading layer-1 blockchain. Price Action: Liquidity Levels To Watch SUI is currently trading at $1.89, just 15% away from its all-time high of $2.18. The recent price action has been promising, with an 8% surge in the past hours. Many analysts believe that if SUI can break above the critical $2 level, the chances of reaching new all-time highs are very high. This psychological barrier could trigger a wave of buying pressure, pushing the price to new levels. However, some investors are cautious, expecting a healthy correction before further upward movement. If SUI fails to break past the $2 mark, a retracement to support levels around $1.60, or even down to $1.45, would not be unexpected. Such a correction could provide a solid foundation for the next bullish leg, allowing SUI to gather momentum before attempting to breach the $2 resistance again. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? Despite this, the overall sentiment remains optimistic, with many investors holding out for a new all-time high shortly.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In The ‘Final Test’, Here’s Where The BTC Price Is Headed Next",2024-10-02 19:00:11+00:00,"Bitcoin has seen a retracement from the $66,000 level, but that does not mean that the bullishness of the pioneer cryptocurrency is completely gone. It is currently sitting around 4% below $66,000, which still makes its $63,000 level very attractive for bulls. Although, given the current movement of Bitcoin, the market could see a deeper correction from here that could send its price spiraling below $60,000 once again. Bitcoin Symmetrical Triangle Could Trigger A Retest Crypto analyst Xanrox has presented a possible scenario where the Bitcoin price could decline further from here. The analyst points to the previous symmetrical triangle that had been formed on the Bitcoin chart with the last decline. This end of this symmetrical triangle sits somewhere around $56,000, which could present a roadblock for the BTC price. Related Reading: Crypto Researcher Reveals Why XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Not A Pipe Dream However, as the analyst explains, a retest of the symmetrical triangle that takes the price back down is not entirely a bad thing. This is because a first breakout of a pattern such as the symmetrical triangle, and then a retest of it is often a positive. This is because it give traders another chance to get in on a good price. Furthermore, the crypto analyst points out that there is an ascending channel that is being broken down on the Bitcoin chart. This also lends credence to the fact that the BTC price could still correct from here. Taking the ascending channel and the symmetrical triangle into account, then it is possible that Bitcoin does fall below $60,000 again. As the crypto analyst explains, the first wave 1 impulse has already been completed, so a correction is in the works. Taking a look at the Fibonacci retracement, the crypto analyst tells traders to look toward the 0.382 level, as well as the 0.5 and 0.618 levels. However, the first two are much more important. When Is The Right Time To Buy BTC? When it comes to buying Bitcoin, the crypto analyst points out that the 0.382 and 0.5 Fibonacci levels are the best time to buy. Additionally, Xanrox points to “an unfilled FVG (Fair Value Gap)” and tells traders that it is within this region that they want to get in on the digital asset. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why Currently, this unfilled FVG is sitting between $60,277 and $61,590. Given this, setting the buy orders between these levels would be advisable. The crypto analyst explains that this Bitcoin gap may not be filled completely, but that even a partial fill would be a good thing. “I am currently very bullish on Bitcoin, and if you buy now and sell above 120K, I would consider it a good trade!” the crypto analyst said in closing.

After this sharp rise, SOL experienced a slight 10% dip, but the overall market sentiment remains optimistic.  Many analysts and investors hope Solana will reach new all-time highs by the end of the year, driven by positive macroeconomic trends and the growing confidence in the crypto market. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Risk Of 30% Drop – On-Chain Metrics Confirm A Slow Demand Key data from Coinglass reveals a rising funding rate, which indicates increasing bullish sentiment among traders. This suggests that the recent price correction might only be a temporary pause before another leg higher.  Investors are closely monitoring SOL’s price action, with expectations that a sustained break above $150 could pave the way for a new rally toward uncharted territory. All eyes are now on Solana as it navigates this crucial support level, with both short-term traders and long-term holders anticipating a positive outlook in the coming weeks. Solana Is Preparing For A Rally Solana (SOL) is currently holding firm above a crucial support level following a small dip that affected the entire market yesterday. Despite this minor setback, the sentiment among investors and traders remains overwhelmingly positive. Many expect SOL to rally and surpass multi-month highs, given the recent strength in its price action. Key data from Coinglass highlights that Solana’s funding rate has been on an upward trend since mid-September. Yesterday, it reached 0.0127%, the highest level since late July. A rising funding rate is typically a bullish indicator, signaling growing demand for a token. The funding rate is a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts, where it can be either positive or negative. It adjusts based on the price difference between the perpetual contract and the spot price, along with interest rates. When the funding rate is positive, buyers (longs) are paying sellers (shorts), which encourages futures and spot prices to converge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? This rising funding rate for SOL suggests that more traders are betting on the token’s future appreciation, expecting higher prices in the coming weeks. With Solana maintaining its current support and displaying strong market fundamentals, the potential for a significant rally remains high. Investors are now watching closely to see if Solana can break through its next resistance levels and confirm the start of a new bullish phase. SOL Testing Demand  Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $145, holding strong above the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at a critical support level of $140. This key area has proven to be a solid foundation for the price, and if bulls want to ignite an upward rally, they must defend this support zone. For momentum to shift decisively upward, SOL needs to break past the daily 200 moving average (MA), which sits at $154. A close above the 200 MA would likely trigger a bullish rally, potentially pushing the price toward higher targets. However, failure to maintain this key support and close above these levels could result in extended sideways consolidation or, worse, a deeper correction. In such a scenario, the next demand zone would be around $110, a significant support level that could attract buyers if the market enters a bearish phase. Related Reading: SUI Ready To Test $2 Resistance – Bullish Pattern Suggests New ATH Soon For now, the $140 support level remains the line in the sand for Solana’s price action. Traders are closely monitoring whether SOL can break through key resistance levels and continue its ascent, or if a potential correction is on the horizon.

The creation of clear rules that will help investors navigate this complex market is something that many are anxiously awaiting. The administration of Trump could reverse a regulatory direction towards deregulation upon regaining power, and this might be favorable for crypto markets. This too falls in line with what is going on in the legal battles Ripple, behind XRP, has faced, and its efforts to clear the controversial status it currently holds in light of SEC regulations. Analysts further indicate that a potential Trump presidency might mean friendlier waters for businesses; this will probably hasten the process of an approved crypto ETF. This will give the investors much confidence and institutional capital into the market, too.

This is significant as the crypto could enjoy an extended rally in October, leading to more price gains for Cardano. Cardano Records First Green September Cryptorank data shows that Cardano has recorded its first green September since it launched in 2017. This raises the possibility of the crypto enjoying an extended rally since it presents a bullish outlook for ADA. Crypto analyst Plutus also suggested that Cardano could replicate Bitcoin’s monthly returns following its first green September. Related Reading: Major Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To New ATH In Q4 Emerges He added that the crypto can accomplish these positive monthly returns in the coming months with looser monetary policy starting to take place. Cardano imitating Bitcoin’s historical monthly returns in the last quarter of this year will be huge for the coin, considering that this is when the flagship crypto records its most profitable returns.  Specifically, October is historically one of the best months for Bitcoin, as the crypto has only recorded two negative monthly returns since 2013. Most of its gains have also been double-digits. Therefore, October could be huge for Cardano if it replicates BTC’s monthly returns.  Meanwhile, although October has historically not been a good month for Cardano, this time is much different, with these monetary easing policies presenting a bullish outlook for the crypto market. The US Fed rate cuts and China’s stimulus package were among the factors that contributed to ADA enjoying a monthly green candle in September. As such, the crypto could enjoy an extended rally as these monetary easing policies continue to roll out.  It is also worth mentioning that Q4 of 2023 was very bullish for Cardano as it recorded double-digit gains in October, November, and December. Similar price gains this fourth quarter will see ADA reclaim $1 and record a new yearly high in the process. This will provide a much-needed boost for the coin, considering it boasts a year-to-date (YTD) loss of almost 40%.  Other Factors That Support An Extended Rally From a technical perspective, Plutus noted that the current Heikin Ashi monthly candle is green, indicating a directional change on the cards. The analyst also revealed that the Weekly Gaussian channel, which flipped bullish back in February, is still green, suggesting that more impulsive moves to the upside are on the horizon for Cardano.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Not Over: CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Where We Are This Cycle Cardano’s fundamentals are also bullish.

This privacy solution will help developers build decentralized applications that ensure that users’ data are well protected, a move that could attract more users to the network. The network is already one of the most decentralized, transitioning to the Voltaire era, which focuses on community-driven governance.  At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at around $0.35, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Will Israel-Iran Conflict Push Bitcoin Further Down? Analysts Discuss,2024-10-02 13:00:12+00:00,"The Bitcoin price took a sharp dip to $60,164 on Tuesday following heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with Iran launching missile attacks on Israel. The escalation rattled global markets, impacting both traditional and crypto assets. Bitcoin was not immune with a notable -4% drop. Market participants, who had anticipated a strong bullish trend for the month dubbed “Uptober,” were forced to reassess as broader market sentiment turned risk-off. However, the reaction to the geopolitical news may be overblown, according to several analysts. Will Bitcoin Drop Further? Macro strategist Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) cautions on the sudden shift in market sentiment. Via X, he writes, “It’s been bizarre observing everyone turn outright exuberant and calling for ‘Uptober‘. From doom to gloom, in a heartbeat […] Conflict in the Middle East notwithstanding, this is an election year in the US. Major uncertainty lies ahead.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why Krüger highlights the volatility typically seen in financial markets during US election years, noting, “In election years, the month of October is accordingly the most volatile, and equities historically display slightly negative returns.” He also added that speculative markets tend to react to uncertainties, and given the proximity of the elections and upcoming payroll data on Friday, further volatility can be expected. “Of course if payrolls come in very strong this coming Friday, equities would rip, as we are in a ‘good news is good news’ regime. But the time to press & hold is after the elections, possibly starting on Election night itself,” Krüger states. Prominent crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) notes the potential for the Bitcoin price to recover despite the temporary market turbulence. “That could be the quarterly low in boys. Markets love to put in highs/lows early on in the candle. Plus, geopolitical moves have a high tendency of getting faded. We may still see some turbulence depending on Israel’s response, but the market is likely anticipating this.” Just like Krüger, he outlines that increased liquidity in the market could provide support for Bitcoin, stating, “Liquidity will start ramping up from now, which BTC should sniff out immediately.” Overall, CRG remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, asserting that despite the short-term uncertainties, “$100k BTC is coming.” Related Reading: Major Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To New ATH In Q4 Emerges Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital also provides its perspective on the conflict’s impact. In their latest investor note, the firm writes: “The Israeli-Iranian conflict has intensified, with over 180 missiles launched by Iran. Despite this, the reaction in traditional financial markets has been relatively muted. The S&P closed only 1% lower, while crude oil (WTI) increased by 2%.” However, the crypto market saw a sharper decline, with Bitcoin facing heavier selling pressure. “BTC closed 4% lower, with support holding around the $60k level. A further escalation in the conflict could potentially push BTC to the $55k mark,” QCP notes. Despite the immediate impact, QCP Capital’s report also stresses that the broader economic backdrop remains favorable for risk assets in the medium term. “Middle East geopolitics will steal the limelight for now, but the shallow sell-off suggests that the market remains well bid for risk assets. This minor setback shouldn’t distract from the bigger picture.” They also point to global monetary policies as a significant factor. “The flush of liquidity from the PBoC and potential fiscal support will likely support asset prices in China, with bullish sentiment potentially spilling over globally to support risk assets, including crypto. […] Assets prices are expected to remain supported heading into 2025, as both the largest (the Fed) and 3rd largest (PBoC) central banks in the world have started their cutting cycles in earnest,” QCP concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $61,286. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"UNI Bullish Rebound Signals Upsurge, Targets $8.7 Resistance Ahead",2024-10-02 11:30:43+00:00,"UNI is making a strong comeback as bullish momentum pushes the token toward the critical $8.7 resistance level. After bouncing back from a recent low of $6.7, market enthusiasm is building, and traders are watching closely for a potential breakout.  With buying pressure increasing and sentiment turning positive, UNI’s rally could gain further upward traction if it manages to overcome this key barrier, signaling a renewed bullish trend and paving the way for additional price advances. The aim of this article is to analyze UNI’s recent price rebound and its potential to break through the $8.7 resistance level. By examining key technical indicators and market sentiment, the article seeks to provide insights into whether its current upward momentum can be sustained, and what traders should expect if the token successfully breaches this critical price point. Market Sentiment Shifts: Bulls Back In Control Following the bullish comeback at $6.7, UNI’s price on the 4-hour chart has continued to gain strength to surge toward the $8.7 resistance level. UNI is also trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting a positive upward trend that could lead to a potential breakout. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line is currently at 45%, climbing from the oversold zone and approaching the 50% threshold. This upward movement indicates that selling pressure is easing, and buyers are beginning to regain control. As the RSI moves closer to 50%, this shows a potential shift toward more balanced market conditions, with the possibility of a bullish reversal if the pressure continues. Related Reading: Uniswap Price on the Rise: UNI Eyes Set on Further Gains Furthermore, on the daily chart, UNI is exhibiting strong upward momentum, marked by a bullish candlestick formation following its successful rebound. The price is now attempting to break above the 100-day SMA, a critical resistance level that could solidify the rising trend. A sustained move above the 100-day SMA would reinforce market confidence, signaling increased buying pressure and the potential for more price appreciation. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed examination of the RSI formation indicates that UNI may maintain its optimistic trajectory as the indicator’s signal line is rising again, positioned at 55% after dropping to the 50% threshold, suggesting a sustained upward outlook. Potential Scenarios: What Happens If UNI Breaches $8.7? If UNI manages to break through the $8.7 resistance level, it could ignite a price surge, propelling it toward the $10.3 mark. A successful breakout above this critical level is likely to draw in more buyers, pushing UNI closer to its next resistance target of $11.8 and beyond. Related Reading: Uniswap Price (UNI) Pumps 20%: Is This the Start of a Major Rally? Nevertheless, if UNI fails to maintain this strength and breaks below the $8.7 resistance level, it might result in a pullback, with the price sliding back toward the $8.7 support zone. A breakdown below this level could lead to further losses, potentially targeting lower support areas. Such a move would signal weakening optimistic sentiment, raising concerns of a more extended bearish trend and prompting traders to brace for additional downside risks.

Reddit,solana,SCAM: ADDRESS POISONING! Habp5bncMSsBC3vkChyebepym5dcTNRYeg2LVG464E96 play flip gg,2024-10-02 22:25:37,"I was looking for answers on the reports of people that received 0.000001 sol from some/multiple addresses.
The addresses are: 

Habp5bncMSsBC3vkChyebepym5dcTNRYeg2LVG464E96  (play flip gg)

fLiPgg2yTvmgfhiPkKriAHkDmmXGP6CdeFX9UF5o7Zc   ( play flip gg)

I did some sleuthing in my wallet as this thing is in my wallet too.: but then i saw other addresses too that,have also sent me 0.000001 sol. I looked o
into those and:
THOSE ARE ADRESS POISONING SCAMS.

I dont know how it exactly enters my wallet but what it does is this:

It sends 0.000001 sol to your wallet after you interact with a TRUSTED address. 
And when you look at the SENDER address, it ALMOST looks EXACTLY like the address you used to do a legitimate transaction to/with.

Example: you have 2 wallets. 
Wallet 1 is called  ABC1....9XYZ

You send 1 sol from wallet 1 to wallet 2.

Then the scambot immediately sends 0.000001 sol 
to wallet 2 .
When you look in wallet 2, you see the transaction of what wallet 1 has sent (legitimate)
PLUS you will see OTHER transaction of what the SCAMBOT has sent you.
When you look at the scambot/sender address, you will notice that THE ADDRESS IS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE LEGITIMATE ADDRESS 

        Wallet 1   (SAFE)  ABC1....9XYZ

other sender        (SCAM)  ABOI... PXYZ

another send        (SCAM) ABCi....gXYZ

CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE A POISONING SCAM ATTEMPT. when you do not pay attention you could EASILY copy the WRONG address to send your funds to.

It sends you transactions from addresses that look like the ones you trust and interacted with in the past.
It does this immediately. I made a fresh wallet and sent 1 sol to it, As soon as i received my 1 sol there were THREE OTHER sends of 0.00001 sol from addresses that looks ALMOST IDENTICAL.

STAY SAFE, PAY ATTENTION ALWAYS.",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

Reddit,solana,World record egg big rug ,2024-10-02 05:36:01,"Hey everyone,

I want to shed light on a recent scam involving the World Record Egg Instagram account — you know, the one famous for having the most-liked post ever.

The account was recently acquired by a new team, but instead of just riding on its popularity, they decided to use it for launching several Solana-based cryptocurrency projects. Their end goal? Draining investor funds using shady tactics, like controlling the majority of the token supply and dumping large amounts (150k, 50k $SOL) repeatedly, which resulted in a Rug Pull and left many investors at a huge loss.

What happened:

	•	Leveraged the World Record Egg brand to build credibility.
	•	Launched three separate tokens.
	•	Manipulated the supply, dumped tokens at a high price, and caused the value to crash while cashing out with millions.
	•	Complete lack of transparency regarding the real people behind the new projects.

What you can do:

	1.	Report this scam wherever you see them promoting their projects.
	2.	Stay vigilant if you follow the account, and don’t get lured in by investment promises.
	3.	Share this post to spread the word so others don’t fall for it.

If you or anyone you know has been affected, feel free to reach out. I’m trying to gather as many victims as possible to escalate this issue and hand over a complete report to the financial authorities.

Stay safe and protect your investments!

Reddit,solana,Blockchain Vending Platform powered by Solana,2024-10-01 00:17:27,"Hey Solana Community,

I'm Will Okojie, co-founder of chebeMCHN, and I wanted to share something that’s been in the works for a while now. We’re building a smart vending platform that goes beyond just convenience — we’re leveraging the power of the Solana ecosystem to completely reimagine how vending machines operate. 🚀

Our vision? Imagine walking up to a vending machine, paying with your favorite stablecoins, and getting more than just a snack or a drink — you get an NFT receipt tied to your purchase, unlocking rewards, discounts, and some pretty cool perks down the line. 🌟 Not only that, but we’re aiming to integrate loyalty programs where members can actually earn from staking the funds we keep on-chain. It’s about giving back to the community and creating a platform that’s rewarding in more ways than one.

We’ve launched our first machine in Denver and are rolling out new locations soon, and we’re pumped to start integrating Solana’s fast, secure, and low-cost network to make all this possible.

It’s still early days for us, but Solana’s tech is giving us the flexibility to offer everything from stablecoin payments to NFTs and staking rewards—all through a vending machine! Who would’ve thought?

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any advice as we work toward bringing this project to life. Excited to be part of this community and can’t wait to see where this journey with Solana takes us.

One of them, 


Memecoins are solely created with the motive of merging with other memecoins and garnering a bigger community. 
Every memecoin bonded on the platform will be deployed on raydium with 500k in liquidity. 

Memecoins merge with other memecoins. 
Communities merge with other communities. 
Bigger cult. Bigger pump. 

Memecoins are created in tranches, each memecoin has to reach a threshold to merge with other ones.
Everytime a memecoin is created a parallel telegram chat is spawned. 
Everytime a memecoin is about to merge. A new telegram chat is formed with a new name. Where community members are redirected and can now chat. Increasing the size of the community and number of holders. 
The name can be bid on by the community and names can be decided on the fly. Community V community. 

Once a memecoin reaches a threshold supply is added for more buyers to come in. 
It repeats itself till we have 500k in mc.

Theoretically, the idea could generate profits, but I want to make sure that I can withdraw my money fairly and keep the project active, ensuring that the team also receives its benefits.

If I lock up 90% of the LP, how can I withdraw the remaining 10% for myself and the investors? Are there other ways to divide the LP that you would recommend?

Reddit,solana,SOL RPC Nodes Management Tools,2024-09-30 10:10:15,"Hey, Solana Fam!  
Today I’d like to tell you how to manage your RPC nodes to get the best performance and the lowest downtimes possible. We will take the GetBlock RPC node provider as an example as they support *SOL RPC nodes* on Mainnet and Testnet. We are gonna learn how they manage their high-speed RPC, and discover some services for node management, handy tools, tips, and tricks  
Let’s jump right into it!

***How GetBlock - RPC Provider Works***

When running an RPC node it’s crucial to be always aware of the consistency and availability of your node. To do so, you have to utilize some robust management and monitoring tools. Here’s an example of the tools GetBlock is using:

* Prometheus open-source monitoring system
* Grafana observability platform; (the latter sources data from the first one.)
* The health sidecar
* Alertmanager service in Slack
* Loadservice
* Auto-switching system

Prometheus gathers metrics and databases to display in Grafana. Prometheus is also bonded to Alertmanager service to inform the team in Slack about all events regarding infrastructure status. The health sidecar helps GetBlock monitor the current height and health of the nodes. To get immediate notifications from the monitoring tool GetBlock connected it to the Alertmanager service in Slack. It helps to get the fastest notification if some issue occurs and always double-check when it’s resolved. The health sidecar is also connected to the auto-switching system. So if the block deviation occurs, the unhealthy node is instantly switched to a healthy one. Last but not least, the node must be updated to the latest versions. This way GetBlock constantly monitors blockchains’ GitHub repositories and social media to find out about the upcoming updates first in hand.  
**All of that helps GetBlock to reach the highest node availability of 99%!**

If you don’t wanna experience all the hustles associated with running and maintaining your own SOL RPC node. You can simply connect to RPC nodes for 50+ blockchains with GetBlock. It’s now even available with 30% OFF your first shared node subscription.",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

Reddit,solana,Does Media Coverage Impact crypto Projects or Just for marketing hype??,2024-09-27 13:26:33,"I’ve been pondering how media attention truly affects crypto projects. 

For instance, Matrix One has been in the news recently with significant features in Cointelegraph and The Defiant, discussing their innovative AI-driven characters on the Solana. 

They even hit an all-time high around the time these articles came out.

It made me wonder, does this kind of media exposure serve as a genuine validation of a project's tech and potential, or is it just a temporary boost for market hype? 

How do you guys assess the value of a project beyond the buzz?

Reddit,solana,Why you must go to Breakpoint!,2024-09-27 08:03:25,"I just got back from Token2049 / Breakpoint in Singapore a few days ago, and honestly, if you're even slightly into Solana or the broader crypto space, you have to go. It was my first time hitting up a major event like this, and as a designer within web3, I didn’t realize how crucial these in-person events are for really getting plugged into the community. 

I skipped the main Token2049 conference (slight fomo), but the real magic was in the side events and Breakpoint. There were meetups and parties happening all over Singapore, from rooftop bars to hawker centers, and that’s where I got to really connect with the Solana crowd. It wasn’t just about making contacts—it was about feeling the energy of the ecosystem. You could be grabbing drinks and end up in a deep convo with someone from Phantom, Solana, or Jupiter. It’s surreal when you realize you’re chatting with people who are building the stuff you use every day.

What made it even better? The whole city was buzzing because Formula 1 was happening at the same time. Crypto + F1 fans everywhere made it feel like Singapore was the place to be. The vibe was so open, too—everyone’s there to share ideas, swap stories, and just genuinely connect. It didn’t feel forced at all. I met so many people from different projects and protocols. Putting faces to the PFPs and building real relationships was the best part.

If you’re a Solana fan, Breakpoint was next-level. Solana’s ecosystem has this unique energy to it that’s hard to explain until you’re actually in the room with the people behind it. The talks were solid, with Toly and the team laying out big visions, especially for mobile. The best part, though, was how easy it was to connect with others. Everything was in one venue, so you could jump from talks to grabbing coffee with the Solana dev you just met, without missing a beat.

The after-parties were, of course, insane. Shoutout to Solana and Solflare for organizing an epic one—think massive warehouse, food trucks, DJs, airdrops flying around, and even a giant inflatable Bonk mascot outside. These aren’t just parties—they’re prime networking opportunities where you can get to know people in a chill, fun setting.

For me, the big takeaway was this: if you want to get in tune with the Solana community (or crypto in general), events like these are a must. You can read all the threads and hop on all the calls you want, but nothing beats in-person convos for building real relationships. Plus, the Solana ecosystem is growing fast, and being there, you can feel the momentum behind it. Whether you’re a dev, an investor, or just a fan, being part of this community in person is next-level.

So yeah, if you ever get the chance, make sure to hit up Breakpoint, or any other big Solana event. You’ll walk away with real connections, fresh insights, and a whole lot of inspiration. Plus, you know, maybe a few free drinks and some killer swag. 

See you all Abu Dhabi 2025! LFG!

Breakpoint has come to a close, and sadly I was watching along from home feeling some serious FOMO!

The biggest note from this year's Breakpoint was a focus on products vs. infrastructure/tooling. Don't worry, there were plenty of goodies for devs too!

Some of the main themes, as noted by [0xrwu of Tensor](https://x.com/0xrwu/status/1838202305713242319?ref=blog.colosseum.org), were cross-chain swaps, stablecoins & payments, embedded wallets, and DePIN. There was also a lot of big news around Mobile and real-world apps. 

Overall, the sentiment around Breakpoint is excitement about the future of Solana!

Here's the rest of the news for Solana developers…

### 🌟 Metaplex Aura

Metaplex has launched Aura, a decentralized indexing and data availability network designed to extend the Solana ecosystem and SVM.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4xzkja681ard1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f886e329c0402ff612cf44679b6e0a84906920)

Aura provides developers with enhanced tools for building dApps by solving key challenges like data retrieval and scalability.

Aura is powered by $MPLX and operates through a network of decentralized nodes that handle indexing and data storage in real-time.

It features three core components:

1. **Data Availability for Digital Assets:** Ensures that assets and media are accessible at all times, even when compressed, using decentralized storage solutions to eliminate reliance on a single point of failure.
2. **Multi-Program Consistent Indexing:** Offers high-performance indexing across the Solana network and SVM, improving how data is retrieved and displayed across multiple programs.
3. **Elastic State Management:** Developers can compress and decompress asset data efficiently, transitioning assets between SVM account space and different levels of state compression. This optimizes performance and reduces costs, especially when managing high transaction volumes.

One of the primary advantages of Metaplex Aura is its ability to improve scalability. Developers can manage millions of assets with far fewer transactions, thanks to Aura's compressed state management.

This reduction in transaction volume not only reduces network traffic, but also lowers costs, making it easier for developers to build applications to handle large-scale user bases without compromising on performance.

With elastic state management, developers can transition assets between SVM account space and various levels of state compression, letting data adapt to the changing needs of their apps.

Aura is a community-driven project that was developed with feedback from over 25 different projects, including NFT marketplaces, infrastructure providers, and game developers.

Launch partners for Aura include some of the top Solana-based platforms and services such as Magic Eden, Tensor, Solflare, QuickNode, and many more.

By open-sourcing the platform (see ⚙️Tools for link to repo), Metaplex invites developers to contribute to its development and help shape and improve the Solana ecosystem.

### 👛 Phantom Embedded Wallets

Phantom has introduced a new [embedded wallet feature](https://phantom.app/learn/crypto-101/embedded-wallets?ref=blog.colosseum.org), making user onboarding easier for developers building on Solana.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QcGq2ikOLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QcGq2ikOLo)

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qtcy89lc1ard1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ab9b37293b53b1c8335613f95220181c3a6b82a)

With seedless sign-in, users can create self-custodial accounts using just an email and a four-digit PIN, removing the need for complicated seed phrases. 

This reduces friction for new users, allowing them to access crypto without app downloads or browser extensions.

The embedded wallet features a full UI within the app, enabling users to swap tokens, view balances, and monitor transactions, all while developers focus on building their core products. 

Additionally, the universal Phantom account ensures seamless access across mobile, embedded, and browser extension versions.

For developers, this simplifies wallet integration, streamlining onboarding and enhancing the user experience. 

Phantom's launch partners include Jupiter Exchange, Raydium, Orca, Drift Protocol, Kamino Finance, and Lulo.

Developers can [apply for early access](https://boo.phantom.app/?ref=blog.colosseum.org).

### 🚅 Bullet L2

Bullet is a new Solana Layer 2 scaling solution being developed on Solana by Zeta Markets, known for its work in creating on-chain derivatives, and Sovereign Labs, a leader in building secure zk-rollups 

It aims to drastically improve the performance of dApps on Solana by using an architecture that combines Solana’s powerful L1 for settlement and data availability with a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that operates off-chain. 

This combination allows Bullet to offer fast transactions and scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security.

The Solana community has long prided itself on being able to scale without the need for an L2. 

Unlike Ethereum, which relies heavily on L2s to handle congestion, Solana has aimed to be a “single giant world computer” capable of processing transactions rapidly on its L1. 

This has made L2 solutions somewhat controversial within the Solana community. 

However, the developers behind Bullet have leveraged Solana’s existing strengths while introducing additional layers to improve performance in specific, high-demand use cases.

For Solana developers, Bullet offers several benefits:

* **Speed and Scalability:** Bullet will allow developers to build dApps that can operate at much higher speeds and larger scales than was previously possible, with a user experience that rivals centralized platforms.
* **Customizability:** By using a modular approach that separates execution and settlement, Bullet gives developers more flexibility in how they design their applications, enabling innovations that are not possible on L1 alone.
* **Seamless Integration:** Since Bullet uses Solana L1 for settlement and data availability, developers can easily integrate their applications with the rest of the Solana ecosystem while benefiting from the enhanced performance of an L2.

Bullet’s testnet is scheduled for Q4 2024, with a full mainnet launch expected in early 2025.

### 👼 Frankendancer... It's aliiiiiiiive!

Jump CSO Kevin Bowers announced during Breakpoint that the Frankendancer client is now live on mainnet, while the much-anticipated Firedancer upgrade has launched on the testnet.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&v=8sl3RcN2Rdk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&v=8sl3RcN2Rdk)

Frankendancer, a precursor to Firedancer, previously achieved an impressive milestone of one million transactions per second (TPS) on a globally distributed 100-node cluster.

Firedancer, currently live on the testnet, is a new validator client with a completely new codebase developed by Jump. It aims to significantly improve network throughput, resilience, and efficiency.

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

But what would happen if it would be the cases as it’s happening on some implementation that use the Ethereum’s ᴇɪᴘ‐197 precompile ?

I mean I don't think this would work:

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

I've confirmed the issues are not related to my JWT and it is not a network/port forwarding related issue.

Does anyone else have this problem with Geth? I'm ready to throw in the towel and switch to a Besu/Teku setup but damn I hate walking away from something like this without understanding why it isn't working

It should be just 2 seconds on L2 and 15 seconds on L1, cost $0.002 on L2 and $0.1 on L1.

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

Reddit,ethereum,Account Abstraction: Crypto Beyond Private Keys,2024-09-18 14:46:04,"Chances are, you have come across the term “account abstraction,” but you don’t know what it means. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

https://preview.redd.it/uliy7j98ykpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab67cd97bb20fc124f47e8b6b274325d3462423

Let’s dive into this fascinating topic and see how it can transform your understanding of cryptocurrency.

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

https://preview.redd.it/d6l81mocxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af084112a700012423b3838f16662eb37501dbcd

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cio8hwgfxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20a3703848b92783e55ea0dfd73e806dba78490

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/iegallxsxkpd1.png?width=2751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb0b8618ebf50cb583ad8fddacc7bedd411d7b3

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Are you staking solo? What’s your take on his proposal?

I'm inclined to just buy more BTC with it and forget about ETH altogether but if there's a compelling argument to keep it, then I'm open ears.

Reddit,ethereum,Can KYC Add Security Without Compromising Decentralization? 🤔 ,2024-09-16 19:18:52,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Global Money Supply (M2) Breaking Up — We Knew This Would Happen Sooner or Later,2024-10-02 09:58:52,"Today, the [global M2 money supply](https://bitcoinisdata.com/m2/) tracked by Bitcoin Is Data ([https://bitcoinisdata.com/m2/](https://bitcoinisdata.com/m2/)) — which consists of the top 5 world central banks plus Brazil—was updated to reflect the latest data as of August 2024.

And, to the surprise of no one, we **hit an all-time high in the global M2**, ending the period of monetary contraction and starting up the money printers again.

https://preview.redd.it/vqttrc71gbsd1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=57a2a980aa6625210f2fa5a7301d185acb49ef05

The main component in global M2 is not the US FED, but the China central Bank, which is responsible **for approximately 45% of the world’s money supply**. And China has recently starting to implement several measures to accelerate its base money expansion, not yet shown in the charts:

https://preview.redd.it/9c8xvfy1gbsd1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5ff04ca571b2e5b0b4286e052951386b3723143

We all know what happens with monetary expansions: the value of each unit of money in circulation drops, i.e., the price of everything increases. In terms of assets, we know that **Bitcoin is the fastest horse** in the race. As an illustration, please take a look at the following chart showing the year-over-year percentage change in global M2 and the price of Bitcoin. You can see that they have a high correlation.

Reddit,bitcoin,"Created a Simple BTC ""What If"" Calculator – More Flexible and Open Source",2024-10-02 22:05:08,"Hey r/Bitcoin community!

I've been using various ""What If I Bought Bitcoin"" calculators and compound interest websites, but I found that many of them weren't as flexible as I needed. I wanted a tool that allowed me to:

* **Specify custom date ranges**
* **Input different amounts on different dates**
* **Simulate regular purchases with varying frequencies and amounts**

So, I decided to create a simple website to address these needs: [BTC ""What If"" Calculator](https://btc-what-if-calculator.vercel.app/)

**What Does It Do?**

* **Single Purchase Simulation**: Calculate potential profit or loss from a one-time Bitcoin purchase over any date range you choose.
* **Historical Analysis**: Analyze Bitcoin's historical performance over custom time periods with interactive charts.
* **Regular Purchases Simulation**: Simulate recurring Bitcoin investments (daily, weekly, or monthly) with customizable amounts and frequencies, even handling semi-complex compound interest scenarios.

**Why I Built It**

I wanted something straightforward yet flexible. The existing tools didn't allow me to input different amounts on different dates or customize the frequency of regular purchases. This calculator aims to keep things simple while providing the flexibility to model various investment scenarios.

**Open Source**

The project is open source! You can check out the code, suggest improvements, or contribute here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Publicker/btc-what-if-calculator)

Feel free to give it a try, and I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just curious about potential Bitcoin investment outcomes, I hope you find this tool useful.

They say it can take 5 working to process and may require documents...

I am am fully verified on etoro since started depositing.

Day 1, i heard nothing.

Day 2, I received an email saying they require

1: passport ID

2: a video of me talking

3: Schedule a call to confirm telephone verification...

I had the call this morning from some guy from what sounded like India, and the end of call was kind of weird, i thought he was going to say ok the bitcoin is on its way, instead there was just silence and i had to ask, well what's the next step, he said i will recieve an email.

Heres the email:

''Thank you so much for taking my call earlier.

As mentioned via phone call, I have sent your case to our Operations department for further review, and once we\`ll have an update, we will get back to you with a response in a reply to this email thread.

Your cooperation and understanding are highly appreciated, and I wish you a lovely day ahead!

If you need further assistance, please reply to this message or chat live with us during our business hours.

Best regards,''

This feels like a very strange email.... almost like a ''failed verification'' email.

I sent them a follow up stating that i have been verified since day 1 and i've done all the steps they have asked and what does ''further review'' mean?

Reddit,bitcoin,Explaining bitcoin attempt 6,2024-10-02 00:49:06,"I liked this one a lot, please critique me:

Alright, thank you for asking.

Bitcoin essentially falls into the same commodity class as gold. Similar to gold, it is viewed as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a decentralized investment.

However, unlike gold, which you can physically own by holding a gold bar in your hand, Bitcoin is intangible. This means it doesn’t have a physical form. The reason gold has remained the number one form of money for thousands of years is because it doesn't erode easily, and its durability ensures it can withstand environmental wear and tear, retaining its form over millennia. Maybe diamonds are better at this, but they aren't easily divisible and have a whole range of other problems in terms of storing value. Gold is also fairly scarce and requires a lot of energy to be mined, making us unable to inflate the market too easily (yet it still went through major fluctuations, like the gold rush) still, no other material has beaten gold as the ultimate store of value—until the invention of Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin has all the qualities of gold, [except it outperforms gold on literally every measure by a long shot.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*KGADAwZD1pktM-rD)

Now, since you might still be wondering what the actual fuck a Bitcoin actually is, since it's intangible and all that, let me give you something to compare it to:

Back during the Dutch Golden Age, many clerks used ledgers. These ledgers were basically books consisting of pages full of transactions made with coins. 

Fast forward to today: the clerks and their ledgers have been fully digitized and automated. Now we have miners and the blockchain. The blockchain is like an old-school physical ledger, except it’s fully digital. Because of how miners work (which is very technical to explain), you now have a fully *decentralized* digital ledger.

The reason why this is so significant is that, unlike the clerks and their ledgers, **you don’t need physical coins anymore!**

On the blockchain, Bitcoin is what’s being transacted, just as coins were being transacted in those old ledgers.

So, Bitcoin can't exist without the blockchain, because Bitcoin solely lives in the transactions on the blockchain. This intangibility gives Bitcoin an unfathomably large advantage in **all** aspects when it comes to being the ultimate store of value, especially when compared to gold.

Keep in mind, gold’s market cap is still valued at 10 to 15 times higher than Bitcoin, and this is only because very old people with a lot of gold are incapable of exploring this new digital asset. The reason Bitcoin is valued 10–15 times less than gold is because:  
A. It’s way too young to be valued at the same level—it's crazy it got this far already, and  
B. A lot of people are *still* unaware of the facts I just shared and are *not* willing to accept them (looking at you, Buffet and Schiff).

Anyway, this was my TED Talk. I hope you all enjoyed it.",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

dont get me wrong, i've been studying btc for a while now but i fail to understand why BTC gives some that extra mile of assurance that other assets do not provide. when discussing other assets that extreme optimism would indeed raise a red flag, right?

For centuries, the Catholic Church controlled the Word of God. Rarely could people read, so they relied on the church for salvation. Even owning a Bible was futile without literacy. The printing press changed this, making the Word of God accessible. This key technology facilitated the Protestant Reformation by spreading new ideas and theological material. One technology shifted centuries of thinking, granting individuals sovereignty, including salvation. Similarly, the internet enabled mass communication, followed by Bitcoin, which introduced absolute scarcity through a decentralized public ledger, disincentivizing violence and theft. On the Bitcoin Standard, prices would decrease over time due to technological advancements. Without money printing, endless wars would cease, and government would truly serve the people, as it did under the gold standard. The printing press separated church and state; Bitcoin separates money and state, as money is just an idea, dangerous to those in power, with narrative control being the ultimate prize.  #Bitcoin",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Monthly Optimists Discussion - October 2024,2024-10-01 09:04:07,"Welcome to the Monthly Optimists Discussion thread. As the title implies, the purpose of this thread is to promote discussion which is guardedly optimistic about cryptocurrency topics. This thread is intended to be a counterweight to the Skeptics Discussion thread and will be pinned when the markets are bearish.

Please read the rules and guidelines before participating.

---
&nbsp;

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence. For example, announcing an obscure online store is adopting coin X for payments and then speculate Amazon will adopt it next without evidence. Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator. Please report shilling or any comments which violate the rules.

I heard you can use crypto to avoid transfer fees, conversion rates and transfer times. By buying lets say 5k USD of a stable coin which im guessing is an immediate thing? Then simply send it over to the person you wanna send it to, where they can then sell it and receive the money immediately.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,US Congressmen destroy Gary Gensler and call him a liar in 5-hour House Committee hearing,2024-09-30 15:39:27,"Hat tip to Bankless for highlighting the best parts of the 5-hour long House Financial Services Committee hearing with the SEC.

A dozen congressmen intensely grilled the SEC commissioners about all their shady and lawless practices. These are the best parts: https://x.com/BanklessHQ/status/1838602054115512769

Gary Gensler was unable to respond to most of the responses and kept waffling. There were multiple times where congressmen got so pissed off with Gensler that they interrupted him and let SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce respond. Pierce kept agreeing with the congressmen and seemed like she was secretly happy the congressmen finally gave her a voice.

**TL;DW**:

* House representatives got the SEC to admit again that cryptocurrencies are not securities
* Got the SEC to admit that they have been purposefully been ambiguous about regulations, which caused malicious damage to the crypto industry, both to exchanges like Coinbase and to banks that serviced those exchanges like Silvergate which would done fine had the regulations not changed overnight.
* Gensler and Crenshaw were roasted multiple times
* House Majority Whip Emmer basically called Gensler a fat liar and said he lied in court. He was so pissed off at Gensler. Emmer said that the SEC broke the law and lied multiple times.
* Torres used Pokemon and sports cards to show how Gensler regulations would classify sales of collectible cards as securities. Gensler was unable to answer why sales of a Yankee's ticket are not securities and again avoids answering the question, which he immediately got called out for.
* Congressmen said that the SEC's treatment of NFTs as securities instead of as collectibles was ridiculous and a 1st-amendment violation.
* Multiple congressmen talked about Operation Choke Point 2.0 and the SEC's role in it and harming the financial industry

###Rules:

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator.


&nbsp;

###Guidelines: 

 * Share any uncertainties, shortcomings, concerns, etc you have about crypto related projects.

 * Popular or conventional beliefs should be challenged.

I am to use an API to get the following data from each Ethereum Block on the Blockchain: Hash and stateRoot.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,[SERIOUS] Before you buy,2024-10-01 11:26:43,"I see a lot of posts around here being very bullish and it makes me fear for people who might be impulsively jumping in. Yes, big players are talking about crypto and investing massive amounts of money, or preparing to do so long term. That does not mean the price will just rile up. It could very well be in the best interest of these massive players for the price of, say, BTC to drop considerably. 

The likelyhood of a gradual drop in BTC price to somewhere in the mid 50s is significant. I am not fearmongering here. The opposite could be true, the price could skyrocket into a massive ""Uptober"" rally... but creating a bullish echochamber is pretty dangerous. The loudest people aren't necessarily the smartest.

Don't go off vibes, don't go off shitty charts. In this game many are out to outsmart you. Do some research, follow interest rate hikes/cuts dates globally, etc. This shit is pretty close to gambling - you have to minimize the random factors or it is likely that you will lose money.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past.

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

NOTE = I don't know if I'll release the code on github, surely at the moment it's a bit messy :P",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments.

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Reddit,crypto,Advice getting papers published to IACR,2024-08-05 01:33:34,"Hello, I'm attempting to publish a couple of papers to the IACR ePrint.  Both my papers have been rejected with little advice on what I need to do to correct them to be ready for publication.  My guess is that since I don't hail from a specific university, that they are auto-rejecting my papers.  Is there anyone around with some experience publshing papers that would be willing to give a pointer or two?

I've read many very brief papers on IACR such as ChaCha related 64 bit ARX Cipher which doesn't have much meat and presents no proofs or cryptanalytic information, however, it was accepted.  I seem to remember the XCrush paper was the same way but I can't find that one on IACR anymore.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);
        record.write(signature);
        record.end_size_header();
        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-10-03 00:51:26.273348

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (
        55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240,

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663
        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(p), [0,7]).order()
        115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 16:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code. If your team-mates cannot understand how your code works, without it being correct, your team-mates won't be able to improve the code without your help. I thought this was an insightful statement. And it illustrates a common problem in crypto development: we often see code that is secure against the latest attacks but is esoteric. Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Even if the code is flawed, as long as your team-mates can refactor the code the code that is legible but flawed will eventually be improved and outshine the original code that is correct **but** illegible.
