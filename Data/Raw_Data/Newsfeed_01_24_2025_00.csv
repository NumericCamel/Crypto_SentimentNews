This pullback reflects the heightened volatility sweeping through the cryptocurrency market, particularly affecting altcoins. Many altcoins, including Chainlink, are facing sharp declines and aggressive price swings as traders respond to uncertain conditions and Bitcoin’s consolidation near all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Ready For The Next Big Move – Analyst Shares Bullish Target Despite the recent dip, optimism remains among analysts and investors. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish perspective for Chainlink. According to Martinez, LINK is currently in the midst of a bullish breakout that, if sustained, could propel the price toward a $50 target. This long-term outlook offers hope for those concerned about the recent retracement, positioning Chainlink as a potential standout in the altcoin market. As volatility continues to dominate, Chainlink’s ability to navigate these conditions and hold above key levels will be crucial for its bullish trajectory. With analysts pointing to the potential for significant upside, the market is closely watching LINK’s price action in anticipation of its next move. The coming days will reveal whether Chainlink can capitalize on its current setup and emerge as a leader in the altcoin space. Chainlink Prepares For A Breakout  Chainlink (LINK) has emerged as a bullish standout amid a volatile crypto market, displaying resilience and strength even as altcoins face aggressive selling pressure and uncertainty. With its price maintaining a clear bullish structure, Chainlink appears poised for another upward move, signaling confidence among investors despite broader market turbulence. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Chainlink’s strong position. According to Martinez, LINK is currently in the midst of a bullish breakout, with a target set at $50. This optimistic projection is supported by the token’s ability to consolidate above critical demand levels, further reinforcing its bullish outlook. Beyond the technicals, Chainlink’s strong fundamentals add to its appeal. As a pioneer in Oracle blockchain technology, Chainlink continues to cement its leadership in the Real-World Assets (RWA) sector. Its cutting-edge solutions, which enable seamless data integration between blockchains and traditional systems, have garnered widespread adoption and positioned Chainlink as an indispensable part of the decentralized finance ecosystem.

With both technical and fundamental indicators aligning, LINK is well-positioned to weather market volatility and lead the altcoin recovery. Investors are watching closely as Chainlink continues to set itself apart in the evolving crypto landscape, with its $50 target representing a potential milestone in its ongoing growth. LINK Holding Strong Above Key Level Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $24.26, a pivotal level that has transitioned from a stubborn resistance to a strong support zone. This shift marks a significant milestone for LINK, as the $24 level had acted as a supply zone for weeks. Now holding firmly as support, it signals that bulls have regained control, setting the stage for a potential surge. The price action suggests that LINK is building momentum to break above the $27 mark, a critical level that could trigger a more explosive rally. With the broader market facing uncertainty and heightened volatility, LINK’s ability to maintain key demand zones showcases its relative strength and investor confidence. This bullish setup positions Chainlink as a standout performer among altcoins, as it continues to weather market turbulence. If bulls can maintain control and push above $27 with conviction, the next rally could propel LINK into higher targets, potentially sparking renewed interest and activity in the altcoin market.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Likely To Fluctuate Between $100,000 And $110,000 Until FOMC Meeting, Says Analyst",2025-01-23 22:30:31+00:00,"After a flash crash to $89,256 earlier this month, Bitcoin (BTC) made a swift recovery, reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $108,786 on January 20. However, according to a crypto analyst, further upside could be limited until the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later this month. Bitcoin To Remain Range-Bound Until FOMC Meeting The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been on a bullish trajectory since November, fueled by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Over the past three months, BTC has surged from approximately $67,000 to $104,536 at the time of writing, posting gains of over 50%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast Of $150,000 ‘Too Low’ Amid Rising Adoption, Crypto Trader Says However, crypto analyst Krillin predicts that BTC may continue to “chop” in the $100,000 to $110,000 range until the FOMC meeting. The analyst suggests that unless the Bank of Japan takes extraordinary policy measures, BTC is unlikely to break out of this range before the end of the month. At present, the CME FedWatch tool indicates a 99.5% probability that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will not cut interest rates at the upcoming meeting. Krillin expects a market dump to follow the anticipated hawkish meeting, which may be partially offset by a dovish-sounding press conference hinting at future quantitative easing (QE). For the uninitiated, QE is a monetary policy where central banks inject money into the economy by purchasing government bonds and other financial assets to lower interest rates and stimulate economic activity. This increased money supply can weaken fiat currencies, potentially driving investors toward assets like BTC, boosting its price as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Krillin’s prediction aligns with a recent market observation which states that BTC profit-taking has declined by 93% from its December peak, and that the long-term holders are back in accumulation mode, preparing for the next leg up. However, how long the current consolidation phase may last is anyone’s guess. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez notes a sharp decline in capital inflows into the digital assets market, from $134 billion on December 10 to $43.37 billion. This low liquidity could result in sharp price swings, increasing the risk of liquidations for leverage traders. Will BTC Peak In Q2 2025? As BTC awaits the FOMC meeting to determine its next price trend, some analysts remain optimistic that the cryptocurrency could hit its market cycle peak in Q2 2025 as more institutions embrace the asset under favourable regulations. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report For example, crypto analyst Dave The Wave recently predicted that BTC will likely peak in the summer of 2025. A report by Bitfinex supports this outlook, forecasting that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 by mid-2025, albeit with minor corrections along the way. That said, Bitcoin must defend the $100,000 price level, as failure to do so could see the asset drop to as low as $97,500. At press time, BTC trades at $104,536, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Despite this sharp correction, SOL has shown resilience by recovering much of its losses, leaving investors optimistic about its potential for further gains in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Ready For The Next Big Move – Analyst Shares Bullish Target Top analyst Jelle has weighed in on the situation, providing a detailed technical analysis that offers insight into SOL’s current price action. According to Jelle, Solana is experiencing “more violent moves, as expected,” while compressing around its previous all-time highs. This compression is a natural phase following such a significant rally and is seen as a healthy consolidation that could set the stage for the next leg higher. With key levels holding firm and sentiment improving, Solana appears well-positioned for a potential breakout. Investors are closely monitoring the market dynamics as SOL prepares for what could be another major surge. As one of the standout performers in the crypto market, Solana’s ability to navigate this volatility and push past resistance levels will be crucial in determining its trajectory in the weeks ahead. The coming days could mark the start of a new chapter in SOL’s impressive journey. Solana Testing Crucial Liquidity  Solana has been making headlines with its aggressive price movements, especially after breaking its all-time high (ATH). Following its impressive rally, SOL has entered a phase of consolidation while holding key demand levels, signaling the potential for sustained bullish momentum. This period of compression is seen as a natural and healthy part of the market cycle, especially after such a strong upward move. Crypto analyst Jelle recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, shedding light on Solana’s current market behavior. According to Jelle, SOL has experienced violent price action moves as it compresses right around its previous all-time highs. This consolidation phase, while volatile, is necessary to build a solid foundation for the next leg higher. Jelle noted that it’s encouraging to see key levels holding firm, adding that it feels like it’s only a matter of time before Solana resumes its bullish trajectory. Analysts across the board remain optimistic about Solana’s outlook, with many predicting that the coming months will be extremely bullish if SOL can maintain its current structure. Holding these key demand levels is critical to sustaining momentum, and a breakout from this consolidation phase could propel Solana into new price discovery. Related Reading: Cardano Will Reach $1.50 Once The $1.10 Resistance Breaks – Details As one of the most promising blockchain networks in the crypto space, Solana’s resilience amid aggressive price action highlights its strength and growing investor confidence. With technical and fundamental indicators aligning, Solana is poised to remain a standout performer as the market anticipates its next move. The coming weeks will be pivotal in determining whether SOL can capitalize on its strong foundation and deliver another wave of significant gains. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Hold Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $243, down over 10% since yesterday as the broader altcoin market faces selling pressure. This decline comes amid Bitcoin’s consolidation just below its all-time high (ATH), which has left altcoins struggling to maintain bullish momentum. For SOL to recover and regain upward traction, it is crucial for bulls to defend the current price levels. Holding above $243 is key to preventing further downside, while a decisive push above the $265 resistance mark would signal a return to strength. Breaking this level with conviction could reignite investor confidence and set the stage for a renewed rally. Related Reading: MVRV Pricing Bands Suggest Ethereum Cycle Peak Is Still Ahead – Analyst Sets $7,000 Target However, the risks of a deeper correction remain if SOL fails to hold support. A drop below $230 would likely trigger additional selling pressure, leading to extended losses and testing lower demand zones. Such a move would challenge Solana’s recent bullish structure and delay its chances of a recovery. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

According to liquidation data from Coinglass, this decline has seen $65.47 million worth of positions liquidated, with the majority ($54.10 million) being long positions.  Crypto analyst Kevin (Kev_Capital_TA) noted a significant range between $96,000 and $111,000, calling it the most pivotal zone on Bitcoin’s liquidation heatmap. This zone could determine the market’s next trajectory after months of back and forth movement trading between this range. Bitcoin’s Liquidity Heatmap Highlights Key Levels According to Kevin’s analysis, which he posted on social media platform X, large liquidity blocks dominate the range between $96,000 and $111,000, which has created an important zone for Bitcoin traders to keep an eye on. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here’s What’s Supposed To Happen Next Liquidity heatmaps visualize areas where buy and sell orders accumulate, often serving as potential reversal or breakout points. The presence of significant liquidity in this range suggests that the market could experience heightened volatility once Bitcoin approaches these levels, and inexperienced investors could be caught up in the price action. The liquidity blocks within this range are highlighted in green in the Bitcoin price chart below. These green zones are high-activity zones that act as a magnet for price action. Notably, the largest liquidity cluster lies near $109,700, slightly above Bitcoin’s current all-time high of $108,786, achieved just three days ago. This proximity to this all-time high means that Bitcoin could undergo another strong price action once it reaches this level. There are many market participants with buy and sell orders here around $109,700. Bitcoin Needs To Break Above its Prolonged Sideways Trading Kevin also pointed out Bitcoin’s extended period of sideways trading, which has tested the patience of many investors. He noted that Bitcoin traded sideways for eight months at the end of 2024, followed by a brief surge in price, only to return to another three-month period of low volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upper Band Moves Above $105,400 – Where Price Is Headed Next Since then, however, the strong bullish momentum has yet to repeat itself. Although long-term holders may still be in profit, short-term traders are feeling the most strain from the lack of any substantial upward price action. The first step in repeating bullish momentum would be to break above the upper end of the liquidation zone at $110,000.  If Bitcoin breaches this range, it could trigger a significant rally or sell-off depending on the prevailing sentiment and trading activity within the zone. However, the lack of liquidity beyond these levels also poses risks, especially below the lower end of the zone. The thinner orders means there isn’t enough hold up liquidity to reject a price breakdown. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,200, down by 2.8% in the past 24 hours.

His analysis, detailed in a logarithmic chart spanning from 2017 to 2025, captures a massive ascending channel that highlights the potential upward trajectory for DOGE. Dogecoin Targets $15 Martinez’s chart delineates a long-term ascending channel where Dogecoin’s price action is bounded by a structure consisting of three parallel trendlines. The lowest of these lines has consistently served as a firm support since 2017, aiding the price to stabilize during significant downturns, notably in early 2019 and again in mid-2022. The median line of the channel, which presently hovers around $0.40 to $0.45, has just been tested by DOGE as it recently surged to this level, marking a critical inflection point that was last touched in early 2022. Related Reading: Dogecoin ETF Filing Takes Market By Storm, Can Positive Sentiment Trigger 200% Rise To $1 ATH? The upper boundary of the channel, which is the focus of Martinez’s bullish forecast, is projected to climb well above $10, touching as high as $15 by late 2025. This top trendline is not just a theoretical limit but has proven to be the bull run top twice for the Dogecoin price, once in January 2018 and then in May 2021. At the last all-time high in May 2021, Doge even significantly exceeded the channel. Martinez’s prediction highlights the spot Dogecoin ETFs as potential market catalysts. He suggests that the approval and launch of such financial products could channel fresh institutional and retail investment into DOGE, propelling it towards these higher valuations. In trading terms, the current position of DOGE below the median line is pivotal. This price level has historically acted as a springboard for upward movement when sustained buying pressure is present. Should DOGE maintain its footing above this zone, the pathway to higher resistance levels around $1.00, and potentially the channel’s upper echelon near $15, appears technically feasible. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Weakens: RSI Signals Bearish Continuation To $0.3 Notably, the spot Doge ETFs could hit the market as early as April, according to Bloomberg’s ETF specialist Eric Balchunas. Bitwise officially lodged the application to register a Dogecoin ETF on Wednesday. The company submitted its proposal, named the “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF,” to the Delaware Division of Corporations, which is part of the U.S. Department of State. Although such registrations can occasionally be misleading, Balchunas confirmed via X: “Bitwise Doge ETF likely coming soon.. and yes I checked and this is def legit (vs some whack job committing forgery for a quick pump a la BlackRock XRP that one time).” Registering in Delaware represents an initial step before advancing to a formal ETF submission with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This registration process sets up the legal structure that would manage the proposed ETF but does not constitute a direct application for SEC approval. This initiative follows an earlier application by investment firms Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, both of which have also filed applications for multiple cryptocurrency ETFs, including one focused on Dogecoin. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.34. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

This behavior of the market in a very unpredictable manner points to the fact that the crypto space is quite unpredictable and that speculative tokens often see tremendous trading activity swings, even as their prices plummet. The trading volume surge by the TRUMP token is more interesting in this scenario of high volatility and uncertainty. Related Reading: Brains Not Working? Ethereum Foundation Under Fire For Repeated ETH Sell-Offs Speculation Fuels TRUMP Token’s Rally Despite its sharp decline in price (down 16% in the last 24 hours), the TRUMP token managed to outdo XRP in trading volume. The rally in trading activity in TRUMP’s token has piqued the interest of the entire cryptocurrency community, with speculation pointing towards a very strong reaction of traders to the token, probably fueled by its political branding or hype around its speculative nature. Donald Trump, the 47th president of the United States, launched the meme coin Official Trump (TRUMP), which is based in Solana, over the weekend. Its price immediately reached highs close to $80, indicating that it was a huge success at launch. At the time of writing, TRUMP was trading at $35.69, with a 24-hour trading volume surpassing XRP’s. In particular, according to CoinMarketCap data, the meme coin has experienced $8.7 billion in trade activity, compared to XRP’s $8.3 billion. Since its inception on January 17, TRUMP has experienced an incredible $38 billion in trade activity, according to CryptoQuant data released on Wednesday. Notably, big sell-offs as momentum cools are probably the cause of the recent price’s sustained high trading volume. According to Dexscreener data, sale volume has recently surpassed buy volume. Meanwhile, XRP keeps growing steadily, while holding the number one spot of the top-ranked digital assets on the market. A short-term jump in trading volumes of the TRUMP token indicated a new shift in interest into tokens that bring more volatility and rewarding trading dynamics. XRP Standing Strong Although the TRUMP token managed to take a trading volume lead over XRP temporarily, it’s not easily replaced in the long run because of its years-long presence in the market. XRP, being an old cryptocurrency, has attracted followers and institutional investment and, thus, is relatively stable in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Surge To $1.7 Million, According To CryptoQuant And Glassnode The TRUMP token is, on the other hand, a recently introduced and relatively speculative asset whose trading volume peak may prove transitory and reliant on the whim of speculative traders rather than being based on sustainable investment. The contrast between the two tokens—one propelled by excitement and the other by solid fundamentals—illuminates the divergent forces at work in the cryptocurrency market. Although XRP may be more resilient, the TRUMP coin is presently experiencing a brief period of excitement and even controversy, which highlights the market’s unpredictable nature and the factors that influence trading activity.

Rexas Finance ($RXS) – Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization $RXS is the native currency of Rexas Finance, an interesting crypto project that’s tokenizing real-world assets, such as real estate, gold, art, and commodities. The biggest benefit of this platform is that it simplifies investments. Investing in gold and other precious metals, for instance, will no longer be difficult and will involve just a few clicks. Plus, token holders will get to participate in fractional ownership. For example, let’s say there’s a massive mansion spread across multiple acres of land, and you don’t have enough funds to buy it all by yourself. In that case, you can use Rexas to own a fraction of the property for a fraction of the price. Speaking of $RXS’s presale, it’s coming to an end, meaning prices aren’t as low as they were, say, a couple of months ago. However, they’re still the lowest you’ll ever get them for. Each token is priced at $0.200, with the total presale funding at $43M so far. Out of the 500,000,000 total token supply, 434,925,318 have already been sold. 5. LuckHunter ($LHUNT) – Online Casino Where You Can Create a Custom Metaverse $LHUNT is the official token of the LuckHunter online casino. The platform itself is like any other: you can play casino games, bet, and win. However, what makes it unique is it lets you create a metaverse of your own digital casinos that you can rent. These casinos will be based in different cities, Las Vexus and Utlantic City (modeled after the real Las Vegas and Atlantic City), and you can lease the tables at your virtual casino for short-term or long-term profits. You can also customize the tables and ambiance and create your own gaming rules. What’s more, you can even host VIP events involving high-stakes games and special tournaments to earn luxurious rewards. 1 $LHUNT is currently available for $0.00138, but the price will increase by 10.5% as it enters the next stage of presale in just a couple of hours from now. Having already raised $1.1M in its ongoing presale, $LHUNT’s official website mentions that its potential listing price will be $0.005, which is more than 260% of the current price. Bottom Line While there’s little doubt that the above-mentioned crypto presales can go to the moon in 2025, it’s important to mix caution with chaos and only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. There will be ups and downs, so make sure you do enough cardio to prepare your heart! Also, none of the above is financial advice, and we highly recommend doing your own research (DYOR) before investing.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Will Solaxy Be the Next Presale to Explode While the Solana Bulls Are Winning?,2025-01-23 15:01:07+00:00,"Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana have held their support levels even when the global crypto market fell by 1.7%, now sitting at a market cap of $3.5T. Bitcoin ETFs have seen four consecutive inflow days led by BlackRock. The investment giant has gobbled up $3.2B worth of BTC. CEO Larry Fink suggests that BTC can reach $700,000 if funds increase allocation to 5% from 2%. This ETF influx stems from the hopes of Solana ETF getting approvals in 2025. Market data suggests a 97% probability of that happening, too. Solana has also seen a significant surge since 15th January. It currently stands at 34% gains from the lows of $181.88 on 14th Jan. During this time, it reached a high of $295.83, gaining almost 60% in 5 days. The price has since stabilized at around $240. XRP also saw a similar price boost as it rose from $2.3545 on January 1 to a high of $3.4 on 16th Jan – a gain of almost 62%. XRP’s price has also since been steady and is now trading at around $3.0886. Ever since Trump won the presidential elections, the crypto market has seen quite a significant boom. Bitcoin reached an all-time high, crossing the $109,000 mark. Trump’s pro-crypto approach and promises to bring in crypto-friendly legislation have kept the hopes of crypto enthusiasts high. There are already early signs of that happening. For instance, Trump’s decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht is being viewed as good news for privacy-preserving technology advancement in the crypto field. The launch of $TRUMP, the US president’s official meme coin, has also drawn the attention of investors. Soon after its launch last week, $TRUMP quickly shot up by over 12,000% overnight. With the influx of various projects, the meme coin market looks bullish for the next year. If you’re looking to ride this upcoming bull run, we’ve got a project you can invest in – Solaxy ($SOLX). What is Solaxy? Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s first Layer-2 solution that looks to solve the issues of failed transactions, congestion, and scalability bottlenecks in the Solana Layer-1 chains. With time, Solana has become slow as the traffic has increased, leading to longer wait times. Solaxy looks to solve this through bundling transactions. Another unique thing about $SOLX is that it’s a one-of-a-kind multi-chain solution that works on both Solana and Ethereum networks. This way, $SOLX combines the best of both networks – Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s transaction speeds, easily making it one of the best meme coins. Having already raised over $13M, the $SOLX presale is off to a flier; here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX if you want to grab some for $0.001612 per token. The next price increase is set to take place within 2 days from now. So, this is the lowest you may get $SOLX for — a coin that could potentially make you a crypto millionaire in 2025. Why Can Solaxy Be the Next 100X Meme Coin? For starters, Solaxy isn’t just another hype-based meme coin. It solves a very important issue faced by crypto investors. By sharing the burden of Solana 1 layer, it batch processes transactions, leading to lower costs and quick turnaround time. This utility puts it in a unique position, making it one of the hottest meme coin presales in January. Also, a new Bitwise report has predicted that the price of Solana ($SOL) can reach $6,636 by 2030 – a massive 3,000% increase. The same report states that Solana’s Layer 1 is far more efficient than the Layer 2 Ethereum chain. Going by the indications, if Solana is able to draw a price prediction this huge, Solaxy soaring by 100x doesn’t look a far stretch. With 30% of the token supply reserved for development and 10% for listing, the developers have shown signs of long-term commitment. Solaxy’s official X page currently has 62.5K followers, which is in line with its aim of building a strong investor community. If you’re looking to take advantage of the crypto and meme coin bull run that’s to come, buy $SOLX now from its official website. However, please note that investments in crypto assets are subject to market conditions. It’s important to do your own research and only consider the above as our well-calculated opinion (and not financial advice).",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Catching The Next Quick 5X: Why The Dogecoin Price Should Be On Your Radar,2025-01-23 15:00:21+00:00,"Recent developments suggest that crypto investors looking to catch the next quick 5x should be keeping an eye on the Dogecoin price. This is based on both technical and fundamental analysis, which proves that DOGE could record a 500% price surge from its current level.  Analyst Predicts 500% Surge For The Dogecoin Price In an X post, crypto analyst Javon Marks predicted a 500% surge for the Dogecoin price, representing a 5x increase from its current level. The analyst explained that Dogecoin is back showing strength, and by its historical performance, DOGE can be set for an over 432% gain at the least from its current level. Related Reading: Dogecoin ETF Filing Takes Market By Storm, Can Positive Sentiment Trigger 200% Rise To $1 ATH? Javon Marks further remarked that the Dogecoin price could rally above the 1.618 Fib extension, which is currently at $2.2. In line with this, the analyst added that market participants could still be early, considering that DOGE could witness a 5x price increase from its current level. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $2. In an X post, the analyst stated that the meme coin had formed a bull flag on the 2-day chart. According to the analyst, this DOGE bull flag pattern puts a target of over $2 for the foremost meme coin.  The crypto analyst had previously predicted that the DOGE price could even rally as high as $8 if it mirrors the 2017 bull run. He added that DOGE could also reach $30 if it mirrors the 2021 bull run. These projections further prove that the foremost meme coin could at least record a 500% price surge from its current level. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi has also previously predicted that Dogecoin could rally to $2 in this cycle and top around $3.  Bullish Fundamentals Also Support A 5x Increase For DOGE The Dogecoin price also boasts bullish fundamentals, which support a 5x increase from its current level. One of the fundamentals includes the potential launch of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Asset manager Bitwise recently filed for a Dogecoin ETF in Delaware, indicating that an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be next. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Power Of 3’ Pattern Enters Distribution Phase: Massive Bull Run Incoming? Asset manager REX Shares, in collaboration with Osprey, already filed with the SEC to offer a Dogecoin ETF. This is bullish for the Dogecoin price, considering the amount of institutional funds that could flow into the DOGE ecosystem if the SEC approves these funds. There is also a huge likelihood that the SEC will approve these funds, considering the pro-crypto climate under Donald Trump’s administration.  It is also worth mentioning that there has been a huge accumulation trend among DOGE whales, which is also bullish for the Dogecoin price. IntoTheBlock data shows there has been a 41% spike in the meme coin’s large transactions, with $23.35 billion traded in the last 24 hours. Another bullish fundamental is Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which puts the foremost meme coin in the limelight.  At the time of writing, the DOGE price is trading at around $0.35, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,XRP koers klimt nav hoop einde Ripple rechtszaak – wat gaat Ripple doen dit weekend?,2025-01-23 14:08:15+00:00,"De recente speculaties rond de Ripple vs. SEC-zaak hebben de XRP-koers opnieuw in beweging gebracht. Investeerders anticiperen op een mogelijke schikking of afwijzing, wat voor een koersstijging zorgt. Ondanks een lichte daling vandaag blijft de markt optimistisch, mede door sterke whale-activiteit en voorspellingen van analisten die wijzen op een potentiële stijging richting $3,50 of hoger. Met de zaak in een cruciale fase blijft de vraag: wat gaat Ripple dit weekend doen? Kan de Ripple vs SEC-zaak deze week worden afgesloten? De speculaties over een mogelijke afwijzing of schikking in de Ripple vs SEC-zaak zijn recentelijk toegenomen. Vooral nu de Amerikaanse SEC haar eerste besloten vergadering houdt onder de nieuwe waarnemend voorzitter Mark Uyeda, verwachten velen in de XRP-gemeenschap een belangrijke uitkomst in de lopende zaak uit de vergadering. Het is echter vermeldenswaard dat ex-SEC-advocaat Marc Fagel dergelijke beweringen onlangs heeft afgewezen. Desondanks bleven de marktliefhebbers vertrouwen houden in het positieve nieuws dat eraan komt, wat op zijn beurt de XRP-prijs aanzienlijk zou kunnen verhogen. In een verhitte discussie op X deelde ex-Ripple-functionaris Sean McBride zijn perspectief op de langlopende Ripple vs SEC-zaak, wat speculaties over de oplossing ervan aanwakkerde. In antwoord op de vraag van een XRP-liefhebber suggereerde McBride dat de zaak binnen een week kon worden afgewezen of geschikt. Opmerkelijk is dat hij neigde naar een schikking, verwijzend naar de alomvattende aard ervan en het potentieel voor vertrouwelijkheid. “Ripple, Garlinghouse en Larsen hebben allemaal recht op compensatie,” merkte hij op, eraan toevoegend dat Ripple ‘letterlijk het script had omgedraaid voor de SEC.’ Zal de XRP-zaak worden afgewezen of geschikt? Het gesprek ontvouwde zich verder toen McBride mogelijke uitkomsten belichtte als de zaak zou worden afgewezen. Hij suggereerde dat Ripple de SEC zou kunnen aanklagen voor schadevergoeding, maar hintte erop dat een schikking waarschijnlijk dergelijke zorgen discreet zou aanpakken. Ex-SEC-advocaat Marc Fagel bestreed deze beweringen echter, en stelde dat een tegenvordering geen juridische grond zou hebben vanwege eerdere gerechtelijke uitspraken tegen Ripple. Hij verwierp ook het idee van achterkamerschikkingen, en benadrukte de transparantie die vereist is bij SEC-resoluties. Wat gaat XRP dit weekend doen? De XRP-prijs daalde vandaag bijna 2% en werd verhandeld op $3,11, terwijl het handelsvolume 3% daalde naar $8,3 miljard. Opmerkelijk is dat de crypto schommelt tussen de $3,27 en $3,11 in de laatste 24 uur. Ondanks de prijsdaling steeg de XRP Futures Open Interest met 1,3% naar $6,9 miljard, wat het sterke vertrouwen van de investeerders weerspiegelt. Ondertussen heeft analist Meesku een voorspelling gedaan: zo verwacht hij dat XRP op korte termijn zou kunnen stijgen naar $3,50 of zelfs hoger. Hij gelooft dat recente whale activiteit en de verwachting van nieuwe financiële producten deze groei zouden stimuleren. Ter ondersteuning van deze visie merkte hij op dat XRP donderdag een abrupte prijsstijging van 5% in slechts enkele minuten ervoer te midden van berichten over ETF’s. De opwinding zorgde kort voor een rally van XRP naar $3,30, maar sindsdien is de prijs gedaald naar $3,13. Hoewel volatiliteit een belangrijke factor blijft in de korte termijnvooruitzichten, gelooft Meesku dat de markt zich positioneert voor potentieel opwaarts momentum, vooral nu de Ripple vs. SEC-zaak dichter bij een definitieve oplossing komt. Met de zaak die mogelijk tot een einde komt, lijkt dit een bullish moment te creëren voor de hele markt. Dit biedt kansen om te ontdekken welke tokens hier mogelijk van kunnen profiteren. Hieronder benoemen we drie presales die volgens ons aanzienlijke groeipotentie hebben. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) heeft zich ontpopt als een rijzende ster in de wereld van meme coins, met een indrukwekkende opbrengst van ongeveer $57 miljoen in iets meer dan een maand sinds de presale begon. Door humor, community-initiatieven en een focus op winstgevendheid te combineren, creëert WEPE een unieke plek in de drukke meme coin markt. Achter de speelse branding met Pepe-thema streeft Wall Street Pepe ernaar om gewone handelaren te versterken en de invloed van Wall Street’s zwaargewichten uit te dagen. Tokenhouders krijgen exclusieve toegang tot crypto trading-signalen, zorgvuldig geselecteerde meme coin-aanbevelingen en een collaboratieve chatroom die is ontworpen om het succes van de community te vergroten. $55M raised.

Nu de presale bijna ten einde loopt en de vraag blijft toenemen, wordt Wall Street Pepe snel een belangrijke speler in de cryptomarkt. Naar de officiële website van Wall Street Pepe Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy (SOLX) is een pionier in blockchain-efficiëntie als de allereerste layer 2 solution speciaal ontworpen voor Solana.

Naarmate de activiteit op het netwerk toeneemt, wint SOLX aan intrinsieke waarde, wat zorgt voor een duurzame cyclus van groei en vraag. Een van de opvallende kenmerken van Solaxy is de aankomende Ethereum Solana bridge, waarmee naadloze interactie tussen twee toonaangevende blockchain-ecosystemen mogelijk wordt. Deze cross-chain-compatibiliteit positioneert Solaxy als een belangrijke speler in de gedecentraliseerde toekomst, met een nut dat verder reikt dan alleen het Solana-ecosysteem. Met een prijs van slechts $0,00162 tijdens deze fase van de presale biedt SOLX een aantrekkelijke instapkans voor investeerders.

Reddit,solana,I top blasted my life savings into memecoins,2025-01-23 16:34:01,"That's right. I went full retard into Trump, Melania, and Vine. Results? I'm up over 100k. This is the most amount of money I've ever made in my entire life. Literally all I did was chase hype halfway through a meme's launch, I didn't get in super early, but I made good profits. 

However I wouldn't have had the money to invest in shitcoins without my bag of SOL I held since $23. honestly I've just been really lucky. 

My (non-financial) advice would be: don't be afraid of selling some of your alts if you find a meme coin with huge hype early. I sold my SOL to ape into those 3 coins and I've rotated my bags back into SOL. 

For now I think I've had enough adrenaline, I might just stake my SOL again and wait it out. I don't want to lose it all. ",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,solana,Working on a new coin for the working class,2025-01-24 00:25:07,"Our coin would be called blue collar dollar, for now based on the solana network. l'm not particularly new to crypto but only have as much knowledge as buying and selling. But wanted to make a coin that would benefit the lower classes by offering protecting from negative whaling tactics and rug pulls.


By doing this we would implement a unlimited buying of the token, but have limited selling capabilities to prevent whales from pulling large amounts out, and dropping the value of the coin,


Limited in a sense that you could only sell x amount of coins a week and as the value scale and supply drops the amount the holder would be able to sell sould also increase/decrease with market fluctuations. This how ever is still a draft example of what we hope to achieve with this coin.


Another protection is adding Location spoofing, and vpn software detection and banning to prevent people from creating mass amounts of wallets to work around the limited selling protection, and our coin would only be offered on exchanges that could back that like coinbase for example, where you have verification requirement for signing up.

I understand we will probably need a team and funding but just wanted to get sole ideas on what where we could improve with just the idea of the coin its self.

We also wanted to add the ability to stake, and offer other features based on community feedback.

We want the coin to be community driven and to benefit those who keep the world moving",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Now i want to tell you that i always make this mistake (i have tried daily trading for week. But each my decision is in 80% terrible. If i reach small profit at least 2 usd i wanna wait for more 10 for example but what happen next. Candle get red color and value start decreasing.

  
I remember a day of Trump Inaguration when i hope for additional growth, but happened opposite. I lost around 60 usd this day. Overaall I lost around 120usd on all crypto what i ever tried to trade since december last year.

Before a few moments around 9:45pm CET i reached some profit around 1.5 usd after i started a position on bad trend. You know what? Me idiot hope for another hype. But i saw a shape of W but rotate on 180 degrees after growing. In this position i had to close position. But i did not do that. After a few minutes the position started falling.

I know my bad. But i need some punch to my face because i need to realize that also small profit is profit.

Shame on me, my mistake, but just not be like me newbies. I am one of us.

If you do not understand each sentence structure i am so sorry. CET means Central European Time and I am basic Slavic guy from Slovakia.

I know some other crypto chains have support options to help reversal of some transfers, I've been searching the web and github and found nothing so far with that as an option. I lost nearly $1200 as a result of this transfer from my main wallet. I imagine there isn't an option but I'm holding out on a prayer that there is. Thanks in advance if anyone can provide any help.

# 🎊 Market-Driven Emissions Proposal

Solana's current inflation mechanism uses a fixed emissions schedule to reward validators and stakers who maintain the network's security. 

This schedule began with an 8% annual inflation rate at the network's launch, designed to incentivize early participation. This rate decreases by 15% each year and is expected to stabilize at 1.5% around 2030.

Validators play a key role, receiving newly issued SOL for validating transactions and sharing these rewards with stakers who delegate their tokens. 

These rewards are composed not only of emissions but also of transaction fees and Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which validators earn by strategically ordering transactions.

The fixed emissions schedule, while providing predictability, has limitations. It doesn't adapt to changing network conditions, meaning token issuance remains constant regardless of the economic climate or staking levels. 

This rigidity was less of a concern when Solana was nascent and needed to attract validators. However, as the network matured, validators became less reliant on token emissions for income, supplementing it with MEV and transaction fees.

The current model continues to benefit stakers through emissions but dilutes the value of SOL held by non-stakers. This has raised concerns about inflation's impact on SOL's overall utility and attractiveness.

The proposed governance change, [SIMD-0228](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/5c9c06daddfb35b6dd9a9317bfa58ac2e52aee0f/proposals/0228-market-based-emission-mechanism.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org), introduces Smart Emissions, aiming to make inflation rates more responsive to real-time network conditions. 

The proposal sets a target staking participation rate of 50%, calculated as the total staked SOL divided by the circulating supply.

* If staking participation falls below 50%, the network would increase token emissions to incentivize more staking and bolster security.
* Conversely, if staking participation exceeds 50%, emissions would decrease to mitigate inflationary pressure and reduce staking rewards.

This adjustment would be programmatic, automatically responding to changes in staking levels.

The proposal includes upper and lower bounds for emissions. 

The upper bound would align with Solana's current inflation schedule, preventing excessive emissions. The lower bound would allow emissions to temporarily drop to zero if staking participation consistently surpasses the target. 

This flexibility allows the network to adapt without over-issuing tokens.

If implemented, this proposal could significantly alter Solana's economic dynamics. Validators and stakers might experience reduced rewards, especially if MEV revenue doesn't fully compensate for lower emissions. 

However, overall inflation would likely decrease, and SOL could even become deflationary over time, mitigating dilution for non-stakers and potentially improving $SOL's utility in DeFi.

This shift would mark a significant evolution in Solana's monetary policy, transitioning from fixed schedules to a more flexible and responsive model.

# 🤖 Solana Virtual Machine

This deep-dive into Solana's SVM compares its multi-threaded, parallel processing capabilities to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), highlighting their fundamental differences and implications for developers.

It also talks about the key role of Sealevel, the technology that enables Solana to process transactions concurrently, and explains how localized fee markets further distinguish Solana from Ethereum’s global fee model.

For Solana developers, understanding the SVM is key to appreciating how its architecture supports dApps with unmatched efficiency.

By utilizing the full capacity of validator hardware, the SVM offers a game-changing alternative to the single-threaded EVM, which struggles with bottlenecks during peak demand.

This article will help deepen your understanding of what sets Solana apart from other blockchains and how the SVM opens new possibilities for dApp development.

# 💰 Multicoin's Solana Thesis

Multicoin Capital’s latest thesis, authored by Kyle Samani, examines how Solana can play a central role in building what they describe as Internet Capital Markets. 

The report focuses on how Solana’s technology and ecosystem have matured to address challenges in finance, with an emphasis on efficiency, accessibility, and scalability.

Since its early days in 2018, Solana has grown significantly, now valued at $100 billion. 

It has one of the fastest-growing developer ecosystems and has surpassed Ethereum in several key metrics, including trading volumes and daily active addresses. 

Multicoin views Solana as a platform capable of outperforming TradFi systems, not just on cost and speed, but also by retaining blockchain-native features like permissionless access and composability.

A central argument is that Solana has the potential to reduce financial services fees by up to 99% while still increasing its market cap to exceed major financial incumbents.

The thesis explains that while payments are not a primary revenue driver for blockchains, they are essential for adoption.

Solana’s transaction fees are extremely low, making it far cheaper than traditional payment systems. This affordability, coupled with its ease of use, encourages the growth of wallet adoption and ecosystem engagement.

Some of the key factors that Kyle highlights in this report are: 

* Introduction of Conditional Liquidity to tighten spreads and reduce risks for market makers
* Implementation of Multiple Concurrent Leaders to decentralize price discovery and reduce latency
* Capable of handling traditional assets, crypto-native assets, and new financial instruments
* Revenue and Value Growth Through MEV
* Expanding Total Addressable Market 
* Expected to play a larger role in global finance as blockchain adoption grows

The report describes Solana’s broader goal as creating a permissionless financial system that integrates low fees, global accessibility, real-time auditability, and composability. 

While Solana serves as the infrastructure, its ecosystem is designed to support  both traditional and crypto-native assets while enabling new market opportunities.

I did my 9-5, went to the gym (almost skipped because I was so excited), came home and finally had the chance to begin my first evening trading crypto. 

  
I got all my wallets created, security phrases stored properly, got BullX going, watched some videos once more to refresh my mind, and decided it was time to purchase some SOL and go to work. 

  
I purchase SOL and get it on my Phantom wallet. I do a small test transfer from Phantom wallet to BullX wallet (SOL) - SUCCESSFUL. Okay, perfect. Lets do this one more time, but with enough money to get my feet wet for the night. Same process - just copy and paste the wallet link from BullX into Phantom and send my SOL. SUCCESSFUL. I check refresh BullX - nothing. I refresh a few times. Nope. I take a break hoping if I give it a few minutes, considering how weird SOL has been, then hopefully it will show up soon. 

  
TWO HOURS LATER and still nothing. I begin to look into forums, join live streams, googling - there is nothing on this really. The only thing I got was about a dozen scammers trying to get me to join their website to resolve the issue. Ok, I began to investigate the transaction details on Solscan. I compared the previous successful transaction to the second transaction.. after several minutes I finally found the issue.

When i went to solscan to check what happened, i found that right before the buy, 0.012 SOL was transfered, then my 0.01 SOL were exchanged for the coin, and then another 0.012 SOL are transfered again.

When the sell order fulfills, i get two transfers to the wallet, one of 1.05 SOL (which i assume are the sold coins), and another one of 0.0125 SOL (which i don't understand), and then 0.02 SOL are withdrawn from the wallet.

I made a withdrawal via Moonshot (actually via Paypal). Well, the money never got there. Obviously, the money was transferred to a Solana wallet. I can view the wallet but not make any transactions. It is also only this one transfer to be found on this wallet.

Can someone who knows something like that can help me? I must have some way to get this money.

I also never specified a recipient wallet in the transaction so I absolutely do not understand how this could happen.

And yes, I have written to the support several times. It's as useless as a steak knife for vegans.

So Im digging into meme coins, trying to understand the process, but one thing that is hanging me up is the ""Liquidity Pool."" I get that its important and related to something called slippage, but I cant wrap my head around what it actually does. Perhaps Im too bound to the idea of liquidity in a traditional asset, which is just a measure of how many market players are interested in the asset: No one needs to light $1M on fire to make sure IBM can trade.  

I guess Im expecting two players: one wants to sell 1000 SampleCoin for 1 SOL, while another wants to buy 1000 SampleCoin for 1SOL. They find each other somehow, presumably through a DEX, the transaction is put on the blockchain and boom fixed.  Yes, thats simplified, the DEX is taking a fee and maybe its actually several transactions with several people to get the amount you want, but where does the liquidity pool come into it, and how does that produce slippage?

Reddit,solana,Meme Trading For Noobs,2025-01-21 21:35:56,"I keep seeing people lose money on memecoins because they don’t know when to buy/sell or what research to do.

I’ve had my fair share of successful 2x plays, so I thought I’d share five key tips that might help you navigate the memecoin frenzy. Here’s what to check before buying any memecoin:

# 1. Liquidity Matters

* **Locked Liquidity:** Ensure the coin has locked liquidity to reduce the risk of developers rug-pulling your funds. Without locked liquidity, the risk of losing your investment skyrockets.
* **Liquidity Size:** Check how much liquidity is available. For example, if you invest $10K in a coin with only $4K in liquidity, you will only be able to cash out $4K, leaving your $6K in the token.

# 2. Community Sentiment

* Memecoins thrive on narratives and memes. Check how strong the community hype is.
* Are influencers or public figures discussing the coin? Does it have a catchy story like $PNUT or $LUIGI?
* Platforms like Twitter are great for gauging community vibes and tracking sentiment.

# 3. Creation Date

* Older memecoins (from previous cycles) rarely perform as well as new ones created during the current cycle. Exceptions exist (e.g., Elon Musk hyping an old coin), but generally, the best opportunities lie with fresh narratives emerging now.
* Beware of influencers trying to revive old coins to exit their positions—they may be pumping their bags at your expense.

# 4. Market Cap

* Market cap helps you gauge how early (and risky) you are in the cycle.
   * **High Risk/High Reward:** Low market cap coins (like early [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) tokens).
   * **Lower Risk:** Higher market cap coins that are affiliated with blockchains like $HYPE, $SUI, $BTC, or $SOL.

# 5. Top Holder Distribution

* A coin is more likely to get rugged if a large percentage of tokens are concentrated among top holders.
* As a rule of thumb, I avoid coins where the top holders own more than 20% of the supply.

I hope these tips help you avoid common pitfalls and make smarter trades. Happy trading, and good luck in the bull market! 🚀

(i)    protecting and promoting the ability of individual citizens and private-sector entities alike to access and use for lawful purposes open public blockchain networks without persecution, including the ability to develop and deploy software, to participate in mining and validating, to transact with other persons without unlawful censorship, and to maintain self-custody of digital assets;

(ii)   promoting and protecting the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide;

(iii)  protecting and promoting fair and open access to banking services for all law-abiding individual citizens and private-sector entities alike;

(iv)   providing regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent decision making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries, all of which are essential to supporting a vibrant and inclusive digital economy and innovation in digital assets, permissionless blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies; and

(v)    taking measures to protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States, including by prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States.

Sec. 2.  Definitions\*.\*  (a)  For the purpose of this order, the term “digital asset” refers to any digital representation of value that is recorded on a distributed ledger, including cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, and stablecoins.

(b)  The term “blockchain” means any technology where data is:

(i)    shared across a network to create a public ledger of verified transactions or information among network participants;

(iii)  distributed among network participants in an automated fashion to concurrently update network participants on the state of the public ledger and any other functions; and

(iv)   composed of source code that is publicly available.

(c)  “Central Bank Digital Currency” means a form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.

Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Blockchain Co-Founder for Nonprofit AI Language Startup (2000+ African Languages),2025-01-23 10:02:59,"**The Problem:**  
OpenAI, Meta, and Orange recently announced efforts to build AI for African languages. But here’s the catch: Africa has 2,000+ languages, many with little to no digital data. Without datasets, even the best AI models can’t bridge this gap.

**What We’re Doing:**  
We’re a nonprofit team building a blockchain and tokenomics-powered solution to crowdsource, validate, and incentivize the creation of African language datasets. Think decentralized data ownership, community-driven contributions, and equitable AI access.

**Who We Are:**

\- A team of **4 founders with 27+ combined years** in product development, startups, and AI/data systems.

\- Backgrounds: **AI engineer, Data Engineer, Statistician, Product Engineer, Non-profit and Funding**

\- Committed to impact over profit (**nonprofit structure**).

**We Need You:**

\- Blockchain/tokenomics expertise (Solana, Polygon, smart contracts, token design).

\- Technical enough to lead protocol development.

\- Aligned with the mission: Solve the data desert for African languages.

\- Comfortable with early-stage uncertainty (we’re pre-funding).

**No Fluff:**

\- This isn’t a “get rich quick” project, it is for the long haul. If you want hype, look elsewhere.

\- We’re not here to compete with OpenAI or any other AI war-lord—we’re solving the foundational problem they can’t ignore.

\- Remote work, no location preference.

**If This Resonates:**  
DM me with:

\- Your experience with blockchain projects

\- Why you would like to join us.

\- A brief intro about yourself

Let’s build something real.

P.S. Already working on African language datasets, blockchain for social impact, or decentralized AI? Let’s collaborate, not compete.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

$1800 in ETH straight up vanished 3 hours after I had received it and was sent to an unknown wallet. The $1800 in ETH came from a friend's coinbase and was sent directly to me. I've never bought anything on the Phantom wallet, I've only ever sent and received. I'm trying my hardest to figure out how the hell it's happened. Somehow the wallet is compromised, but I'm struggling to figure out how it's happened. The password is strong/generated by a password manager, I've not shared the private key or seed phrases (the wallet is a week old).

Nothing else was accessed, eg bank, email, any other accounts, just the Phantom wallet (which I have on a chrome extension and on my mobile, which I had downloaded last night).

The wallet that it went to has only seen IN transactions then whatever is the latest (explanations please)

https://etherscan.io/address/0xd924cC0A843a023ba07a436d779Ec1480Dc4c359

Anyone able to advise on where I went wrong?

Never been interested in nfts, airdrops (don't have a clue what they are), not been clicking or trying receive any free shit.

I've been trying to go over absolutely everything I did yesterday and the only thing I can think I went wrong was when I was researching the melania meme coin, I don't know if I had synced or logged in with the Phantom Wallet (that had $0 at the time) to a site when I was looking into ways to buy SOL. I had logged into ape.pro via the Phantom Wallet and I believe I had connected my wallet to uniswap. Something that stood out was there was a jupuary.jup.ag link in my history which I do not recall visiting and nothing prior to the website showing to indicate that I had purposely went out my way to visit.

Any ideas? Anyone able to look into the etherscan to find any clues as to who or what the wallet of the person who stole the money is?

Tl;dr: I'm new as fuck to crypto, have no idea how $1800 was stolen",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,ethereum,HELP - I Need Private Client Server Communication in Web3,2025-01-21 01:22:01,"I won't go into all the fine details here, but the basic problem is I need a way for a client to pass a message to a server and receive a response without the server learning the IP of the client. The message is small and can fit into a tx payload with ease, but I do not want to spam messages into the chain. The server can know the Ethereum address of the client. The solution does not have to be Web3 native. The solution must run in a browser env ( IE I can not handle raw TCP comms at the low levels ). 

I have considered OHTTP via Cloudflare ( not sure if this will actually work in a browser though )

I have considered passing the messages using Txns in chain but hate this idea since it is slow and wasteful in terms of user resources and server resources.

I have considered XMTP but this system is still early stage and highly centralized - meaning it could go offline at any time.

I have considered IPFS but this is a huge pain to say the least and I would prefer to not use it.

I have considered Whisper ( or Wagmu I think is the new name ) but Whisper had terrible support back in the day and I fear it still might.

I have considered Tor but this can not be done in a browser.

I have considered I2P but this can not be done in a browser.

Honestly, at this point I would be happy with paying for a reverse proxy that strips all of the client IP address info and blackholes the logs but I can not find any well established services like this. I did try routing through Cloudflare but for some reason their system always includes the X-Forwarded-For or some variant header no matter what worker stripping or rule stripping you set up...

So I come to you degens looking for something I have not thought about or an idea about how to do one of the above.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

2. Will layer 2s work with anything Ethereum?  I got into using Dex’s because I wanted some of the mid and micro cap coins I couldn’t find on exchanges.

i aleady loaded up more ETH but i it keeps telling me i need more for a transaction. In my understandings this has nothing to do wit gas fees cause they were like 0.0001 ETH so i dont understand where this is coming from and its frustrating.

Reddit,ethereum,Best Way to Stake Ethereum with a Small Portfolio?,2025-01-19 12:57:23,"Hi everyone,

I’m just starting to invest in Ethereum and exploring staking as a way to earn passive income. At the moment, the ETH part of my portfolio is really small—under $200. I’m doing DCA, so my holdings will gradually grow over time, but for now, it’s definitely modest.

I’ve done some research into staking options, but I must admit that I'm a a bit overwhelmed since I’m still a beginner. Having advice from experienced people would be really helpful.

What’s the best way to stake ETH with such a small amount? Should I simply stake it directly in the exchange until I have a bigger amount?

I want to choose a method that works well for small portfolios but I'm open to suggestions to transition into once it gets bigger. Thanks in advance for your insights! Looking forward to learning from you all.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum’s Scalability Paradox and the Forgotten Stakeholders: Investors,2025-01-19 10:37:51,"Let me just start by saying I am a big believer in the Ethereum ecosystem. I know that this post may be downvoted a lot, but I think it is important to raise these issues and constructively discuss them. That said, I am here to learn and I acknowledge that my understanding might be flawed. If that’s the case, I welcome your insights to help me understand better.

**1. Are L2s hurting Ethereum's tokenomics?**

Layer-2 solutions are critical for Ethereum's scalability, but they seem to be harming its economic model. L2s inherently designed to reduce Ethereum's base layer (or Layer-1) demand. Lower demand, means lower gas fees and by extension reduced burn rate with EIP-1559. Further limiting Eth's deflationary pressure. This can be visualized on Eth supply chart [here](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETH_SUPPLY/). 

With reduced demand, ETH’s price could stagnate or decline. This hurts all investors, validators included.

**2. Failing to understand that every Validator is Investor first.**

Validators are important for maintaining **security and decentralization** of Ethereum network. However, we fail to understand that every validator is an investor first (in a Proof Of Stake environment), and are only tied to the project until it is profitable for them. If Eth price continues to stagnate eventually they will move to other chains. Ultimately compromising Eth's Security and Decentralization. 

**3. Not enough focus on investors?**

I wholeheartedly agree and encouraged by changes in [EF leadership and goals](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1880635379771904423). However, would like to understand what does ""having a vested interest"" mean? Ethereum is a Proof of Stake network. Every validator, investor, developer and user have vested interest. 

I understand that EF is trying to eliminate any influence that large investors (institutional and individual) may have. However, they should be cautious not to ignore the role of the ""investor"" as an important actor contributing to the Ethereum network. 

**4. Community being too critical when investors voice their opinion on price movement.**

While there is a dedicated sub to discuss price movements r/ethtrader, sometimes it isn't that straight forward. When fundaments are not supporting price movements they should not just be discussed but should be encouraged. Often, people here who discuss price are looked down upon despite having very valid points. Community should understand that Ethereum is **Proof of Stake**, and ""Stake"" i.e. Eth as token is integral part of consensus mechanism. 

My hope with this post is to spark constructive discussion and, hopefully, bring about necessary changes if/where they are needed.

Edit: The post doesn’t discuss price increase/decrease, but rather discusses how change in fundamentals are affecting investors (i.e. validators, developers and users) in Eth token.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum Blobs - Calls for upgrades vs FUD,2025-01-18 17:25:54,"I'm seeing a lot of confusion and misunderstandings on other platforms regarding blobs so I thought I would cross-post this here.   
  
**Previous FUD** = There wouldn't be enough demand for Ethereum DA (blobs)  
**The Truth** = There is more than enough demand and it's growing  
  
**New FUD** = Ethereum won't be able to cope with demand and will either lose out to alt DA or (much) worse alt L1s.   
**The Truth** = Both the devs and the community are aware of the demand and have; Short/Mid/Longer-term solutions. Calls to action are not FUD but many are unaware that there are solutions and this is where the FUD is coming from. Layer 2s can also make trade offs and use ALT DA whilst still paying Ethereum Layer 1 for proofs this is still far better than users going to alt L1.   
  
Before I get into solutions let's cover the **basics of Blob vs Block Storage:**  
Blocks = Persistent = \~90KB on average   
Blobs = Temporary = 128KB Max  
Blob Market (current) = Target 3  / max 6 (per block)  
  
**- Short-Term Solution (Mid/Late March):**  
Pectra: Blob Market = Target 6  / max 9  
  
**- Longer-Term Solutions:**  
PeerDAS - using data availability sampling for blobs will dramatically increase supply to the blob market. Other solutions are being discussed with even longer time frames but these will evolve over time.   
  
**- Mid-Term Solutions:**  
Between Pectra and PeerDAS blobs and the blob market can be upgraded with a soft fork and/or a hard fork that only focuses on blobs requiring less testing and overhead (quicker to implement). These mid-term solutions will likely depend on the community pushing for them. Alternative DA options can still be Ethereum-aligned and will be part of the overall mix of solutions different use cases will likely require different solutions and implementations.   
  
**The Oversimplified Debate:**  
L2s don't pay enough vs L2s need to grow to compete  
  
**More thoughts from Intern:**   
This debate is often framed as 2 opposing ideologies but perhaps it is also 2 different time horizons. While it is true that Layer 2s are currently paying less than they have done historically whilst serving more users it is also true that the market has changed and expects cheaper transaction fees which are available outside the Ethereum ecosystem. Right now the Blob market is highly reactive but once the Blob market grows changes in demand will lead to a more proportionate change in costs and may ultimately result in more being paid to the Layer 1 over the long term. Put simply if fees paid to the L1 per transaction have been reduced by 1000X then if L2s can grow their transaction count by over 1000X then they will pay more overall but growth takes time, investment, and builders. ",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650
Reddit,ethereum,Make Blob sizes dynamic ?,2025-01-19 01:51:08,"Perhaps a noob question but:

Pectra is supposed to increase Blob sizes to accommodate more throughput and lower fees, however this will hurt the holders (less burn until more througput comes in).

**Why can't we make Blob sizes dynamic?**

\- Increase in size (automatically) when demand is needed and decrease it when demand is low in order to strike a balance to allow a healthy - constant burn of Eth.

Wasn't Ether supposed to be **Ultra sound** money?

I know we need to attract more projects to join in as L2s (by having lower fees), but if other L1s take ""our cake"" before we achieve our objective, we won't attract more L2s either ways.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,ethereum,What is the current state of Eth?,2025-01-19 16:18:32,"Hi,

I used to mine Eth and was a staunch advocate for the project from about 2018-2022. I loved the project! There was always a new drop or project launching on the network and it seemed like Eth would be the project to lead the decentralized DeFi future that I was invested in. I am not a miner that just quit because they went PoS, I was excited and bought the reasons why PoS was a positive. I do miss the insane profits I was getting from mining it, but I had accrued decent number of coins that I was ready to stake to continue the ecosystem. Then, it happened. PoS mainnet upgrade occurred and not only could I not mine, but it took two months for me to find a reputable staking pool.

Fast forward to 2022 and I had completed staking some coin and was left with very small gains in reference to the time I locked the coins up. No big deal, but what was the state of the project? Basically dead. What happened to PoS and the DeFi revolution that I believed in? Well, the insane amount of coin required to run a validator node led (everything from here on is my opinion/perception) to a situation where majority of node owners were the same financial institutions that I was hoping to stick it to. The rich now controlled block validation and the average joe's only option was to buy small amounts of coin and stake it on a pool, hoping it didn't get stolen. Feeling disillusioned with the project, I sold my coins.

It doesn't seem like the PoS move has done any of the proposed goals. The price is stagnant and I don't see the enthusiasm for projects and when I think about nodes I can't help but picture rich people just watching their holdings grow.

I still hold out hope, so what's going on? Anything exciting?",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,ethereum,Bridged USDC ETH/USDC SOL & Cannot find it.,2025-01-18 21:46:40,"I'm somewhat new to crypto, so I'm really seeking some help. I have previously made the mistake of sending crypto to the wrong wallet way back in 2020. Last night in my attempts to convert USDC ETH to USDC SOL, I tried using Soflare to bridge my USDC. While I think it went through, I cannot for the life of me understand what is happening. Today my Coinbase Wallet shows I still own USDC ETH with the same balance, and Metamask shows the same. However when I try to send it, sell it, etc. I'm unable to do so. I THOUGHT the transaction went through, but was in such a rush to purchase the $TRUMP coin last night I had to go ahead and use a different app to get that purchase through. Today however I cannot seem to move my USDC, sell it, or do much of anything and I'm trying to understand what the heck happened. At this point I've spent several hours trying to figure this out, and would really appreciate some help.

Under my transaction history, I have something called a ""Smart Contract"" but I don't understand if I still have my USDC (It does show up) or if this is just an issue with Coinbase Wallet where I temporarily can't do anything with my USDC. If you need any other information to find out what happened, please by all means let me know so I can include that. I would be willing to send someone a small fee to help me here, I'd also like some understanding for future reference so I can further my understanding of Crypto.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

I just read this about DeSci  nd wanted to share because it’s actually kinda cool? Can blockchain really fix it?

# Funding is broken 

Getting money for research is like a nightmare -  bureaucracy, not enough transparency. With DeSci, they’re talking about using DAOs to fund research projects and share research quickly. 

# Turning research into real stuff

Getting from ""cool discovery"" to ""real-world product"" takes forever. Smart contracts could make it faster and ensure researchers actually get paid for their work instead of just getting a ""thanks"" and a handshake.

Plus there is the blocked papers (Journals charge a fortune from what I know to get a paper published)

Reddit,ethereum,Does Ethereum Foundation Really Doesn't Care About Numbers Go Down?,2025-01-18 21:23:46,"In this community people often shame me for only looking at the numbers and care about making profit, and their argument is always we have superior tech, more L1L2 usage, or metrics that doesn't help with profit.

The Ethereum dev circles are like a bunch of people that doesn't talk much about numbers, it seems like they don't care if the numbers go up or down, and to them building ""better"" product is the only thing important.

This entire community seems to force people to be ""in it for the tech"" and largely ignored investors and think they are shortsighted subpar human that are filled with greed and only care about profit.

From my perspective, Ethereum Foundation and dev circles see themselves as a higher tier elitist because they know the code, have higher moral standard and have the ability to build on the project, so they only communicate within themselves.

They also don't care about if other entity want to build project on Ethereum and not willing to give them even a little bit of recognition, and rarely talk about projects being built by third party on the network, for comparison look at Solana tweeter, they are actively interact with projects build on their network.

BUT the fact that Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum are able to grow to this size is largely because they benefits from numbers going up, Ethereum started with an ICO, crowdfunding from investors, and without numbers going up, they won't be able to grow as fast, won't be able to sell their ETH to pay their employee, fund their projects.

There's no tech company or tech project in this capitalism world doesn't care about numbers going up are able to sustain, to grow, to hire more talent, to increase adoption, to promote awareness.

If the numbers stop going up, eventually the funding will be dried up, talents will not waste their talent to build on the network if it won't be rewarded, and it will just slowly fade into irrelevance.

I think Ethereum Foundation should start allocate more fundings on their marketing department, and their business development department. Start talking to more businesses to consider building their project on the network, talking to more developers to build, interact more with anyone still have any interest in Ethereum, be it just investors that only cares about profit or businesses or coders, do more sponsorships, be more aggressive in marketing.

Attract more capital to expand and grow, provide more grant to promising project, etc

Stop shaming people only care about profits and numbers going up, these are investors, the only people still believe in the project and invested their money into project, stop telling them to fuck off because they complain about the numbers going down, in real world do we see tech company telling their VC to fuck off because their VC complain about non-performing?",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,ethereum,What if we made a crypto with AUTO Trickle Down: free money for new users and tax write-offs for the rich?,2025-01-18 17:43:15,"I had chat GPT write it but basically inactive wallets, and whale wallets would get taxed a tiny amount each month if the qualifying triggers don't change.

And new users with no funds automatically gets part of that pool of money. So the incentives are equal. 

Also unspent money or inactive wallets (forgotten passwords), will automatically get taxed so over time eventually cleared out, and put back in circulation. It solves that problem too.

Reddit,ethereum,To Pump The Gas Or Not: Analyzing The Ethereum Gas Limit Debate,2025-01-17 20:56:20,"As Ethereum continues to evolve, one of the key topics being discussed is the proposal to increase the gas limit. This proposal has garnered a ton attention among the community for its potential to scale the network, reduce transaction fees, and enable new types of decentralized applications (dapps). However, a higher gas limit also raises important concerns about decentralization, validator hardware requirements, and overall network stability.

In this post, I’ve shared an article that delves into the origins of the proposal, potential benefits, and the challenges that come with it. The article covers:

- The history of past attempts to raise gas limits on Ethereum 
- How the gas limit could be gradually raised without a network fork
- Predictable effects of a higher gas limit, like lower gas fees and improved transaction flows
- The potential for new types of dapps, such as on-chain AI and large-scale token operations, to emerge if network capacity increases 
- Risks to decentralization and security, including validator hardware requirements and MEV disparities, and other potentially negative byproducts of higher gas limits

If you’re interested in a deep dive on the topic, check out the article and share your thoughts. What do you think about the gas limit increase? Could it help Ethereum scale without compromising its core principles?

Read the full report here: https://research.2077.xyz/to-pump-the-gas-or-not-analyzing-the-ethereum-gas-limit-debate-1

PS: We've also written a thread breaks down the gas limit and explains (at a high level) what raising gas limits could mean for scalability, fees, dapp developers, and network health: https://x.com/2077Research/status/1880343190412103870.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,ethereum,Questions About Layer 1’s,2025-01-17 04:40:01,"Hi everyone! I just got into self custody of my coins and swapping for newer/smaller tokens that aren’t listed on exchanges yet. 

This drove me to really want to understand how layer 1’s prices are driven up by the layers 2’s. For example, does Ethereum’s price go up because people are buying the layer 2’s and holding them? Or does it go up because of people holding stack of Ethereum’s to pay for gas fees? 

This is also making me wonder for example why Solana’s price has gone up compared to Ethereum (besides Ethereum gas fees), because even though Solana has cheaper gas fees, I don’t see the amount of legitimate projects on it compared to Solana. For example, every time I see a video on an up and coming AI project, gaming or any other hot niche it’s almost always on Ethereum. Is Solana just getting its boost in market cap off meme coins and/or big investors holding SOL just to hold combine with the narrative on better speed and gas fees?? 

This is NOT me hating on Ethereum. I’m just genuinely curious because Ethereum’s ecosystem is bigger and still continuing to get projects from my understanding.

Reddit,ethereum,Response from United States Senator to my email,2025-01-16 19:13:08,"I filled out one of those automated Coinbase ""Stand with Crypto"" emails and sent it to my Senator- Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire.

Response from her/her office below:

**""Dear XXX,**

**Thank you for contacting my office regarding cryptocurrency. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this important issue.**

**As you know, a cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that can in limited circumstances be used for purchases of goods and services, but can also be used for a variety of other purposes, including speculation. Unlike the dollar, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, cryptocurrencies use a distributed online ledger to secure and account for transactions. This means that users of cryptocurrencies have limited recourse through the traditional legal or financial system if, for example, an item purchased with cryptocurrency never arrives, or if the value of a particular cryptocurrency declines significantly.**

**Due to the rapid development of this new technology and proliferation of new types of cryptocurrencies and tokens, federal regulators have not yet taken meaningful steps to ensure that increased adoption of cryptocurrencies does not result in criminal or fraudulent use or threaten the stability of our financial system. While I believe it is important we allow for healthy innovation in this new technology, it is also important that we protect consumers against cryptocurrency fraud and scams and prevent criminal activity like ransomware demands or money laundering.** 

**Most legislation that would make changes to the regulation of cryptocurrency would be referred to either the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs or Senate Committee on Finance. I am not a member of either committee, but I am carefully monitoring developments in this nascent technology and should relevant legislation come before the full Senate for consideration, rest assured that I will keep your thoughts in mind.** 

**Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, and please do not hesitate to contact my office in the future.""**

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

I'm currently in a position where I can invest $2,000 a month to whatever I want.  My options are buy more BTC, pay off my house in 8 yeas instead of 26 years or apply it to traditional investments (S&P, IRA..etc).  

I believe BTC will do great in the coming years, but as it gets more expensive, my $2K buy less and less.  I don't know if I'll be able to own enough BTC by the time I ready to retire...I also wonder if bitcoin is a great retirement strategy?

Reddit,bitcoin,Inflation in numbers: How much harder are we working? Comparing 1970s and 2025,2025-01-23 13:45:43,"How things have changed since the 1970s in terms of how much we work to afford basic things like housing and rent.

**Spoiler: We're working harder and earning much less for it!**


---

**1. Wages:**

1970 Average Hourly Wage: \~$3.50/hour

2025 Average Hourly Wage: \~$25.72/hour (U.S. national average)

Now, $3.50/hour in 1970 should be equivalent to around **$123/hour today**, based on the money supply increase (M2), which grew by a **35x factor** from 1970 to 2025.

In simple terms, to keep up with inflation and money supply growth, wages should have grown by about 35x times, not just 7 times as they have.


---

**2. Housing Affordability:**

1970 Average Home Price: \~$17,000

2025 Average Home Price: \~$374,900


Working Hours to Buy a Home:

1970s: 4,857 hours (at $3.50/hour)

2025: 14,580 hours (at $25.72/hour)

Home prices have increased by about **22x** since the 1970s, but wages have only increased about 7x.

If wages had kept pace with the 22x increase in housing prices, wages should be around **$77.18/hour**.

And these are just averages, we're not even looking at the ridiculous cities like: Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Miami, SFC, London, Sydney, Ottawa.


---

**3. Rent Affordability:**

1970 Median Monthly Rent: \~$108

2025 Median Monthly Rent: \~$2,000


Working Hours to Pay Rent:

1970s: 31 hours/month (at $3.50/hour)

2025: 78 hours/month (at $25.72/hour)

Rent has increased by about **18x** since the 1970s, while wages have increased by 7x. To match 1970s affordability, today's wage would need to be closer to **$64.50/hour**.


---


**4. The Changing Nature of Work:**

Today’s jobs are far more complex than in the 1970s, especially in fields like technology, finance, and engineering. For example:

Computer Engineers and Software Developers must not only possess years of education but also continually upgrade their skills to keep up with rapid technological change.

Stock Traders and Investment Bankers are under immense pressure to beat market returns and take on more risk to justify their pay. This requires constant analysis, long hours, and a high level of mental stress.

Many of these jobs have become headache-inducing as the demands increase and the pressure to perform is relentless.

These roles can often come with long working hours, high stress, and little downtime, but the pay doesn't reflect the level of education, output, or stress compared to the 1970s.

So for example, earning $55/hour as a Software Engineer, you are still making less than a Grocery Bagger in the 1970s, because you must work more hours to pay rent or buy a house.

Higher education vs. uneducated, high responsibility vs. no responsibility, and yet, you're working longer hours for less purchasing power.


---

**Key Takeaways:**

Money Supply & Inflation: The money supply (M2) has increased 35x from 1970 to 2025. If wages had kept up with that growth, today's wages should be about $123/hour.

Housing & Rent: While wages have increased by 7x, housing and rent prices have far outpaced that growth, making them much less affordable today than in the 1970s.

Working Harder for Less: Despite the increased complexity and higher educational demands in today’s jobs, we're still working harder, producing more results, and receiving less. Wages haven't kept pace with the mental and physical demands of modern jobs.

**What is a Fair Wage?** To compensate us for the higher complexity and greater output, we should be earning **MORE THAN** $123/hour today. The average salary should be closer to **$250/hour** to make all that education, experience accumulation, increased productivity and its related stress worthwhile.


---

**So in conclusion,** IF YOU ARE EARNING LESS THAN $250/hour, you are right to feel EXHAUSTED and CHEATED.

Considering that I'm a software engineer earning less than 1/5th of that, it explains and makes sense why I feel absolutely exhausted all the time, and can't even come close to owning a home or feel financially safe enough to start a family.

At the time, I wasn’t even considering the possibility of Bitcoin being recognized as a strategic reserve by companies, states, or even countries.

Now, it seems that’s exactly what’s unfolding. The President of the United States, cabinet members, senators, congressmen, bankers, and industry experts are all starting to grasp the strategic advantage. I never imagined this when I began buying.

And yet, the most surprising part? The market remains unmoved. I feared that as this recognition grew, I’d find myself paying 50%, 100%, or even 500% more for the same amount of sats.

But here we are—a clear path ahead, and Mr Market is asleep. ",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,bitcoin,Exit strategy?,2025-01-23 22:23:18,"What is your (short term) exit strategy?

Here is mine. Any feedback welcomed.

Once Bitcoin reaches $150k, I plan to DCA out by selling 1 BTC per week so long as it remains at $150k or higher.

At this sell point, I would be able to pay off the mortgages on 2 rental homes that bring in approximately combined $300k per year in rental income (plus pay the gains taxes, which would be long term since I've held for 5 years). 

Once the mortgages are paid off, I will use all of the rental income to DCA back into Bitcoin over time. 

I consider this a short term exit strategy because i would plan to DCA back in. My conviction is strong, but after living through November 2022, I'd rather have the real estate paid off, which guarantees a monthly return in the case that shit hits the fan and everything goes to hell in a hand basket. The peace of mind is quite valuable to me.

I realize that over the long term, holding the BTC is likely the best choice and would yield  a higher return. However that comes with significant risk as well, especially regarding self-custody and potential points of failure there. 

Open to any thoughts/feedback I may be missing. This has been my strategy since 2022 and I hope to see it through.

Reddit,bitcoin,Mistakes & What This BTC Mom Did Right Hodling for 10+ years,2025-01-22 20:00:13,"TLDR: Put in what you can afford, don’t obsess over price or even check if you can help it, continue investing. Don’t let your ego stop you from increasing your cost basis.

First of all, in 2013 when I got into BTC, this was one of the first places I came to find out what it was all about. Thought I’d write some thoughts that may or may not be helpful to a newbie. 

I came across Bitcoin in late 2013 when I had a newborn and was home with small children. I’m the type of person who researches things to the death and kind of go on kicks when I find something interesting. I put in a lot of reading and came to the conclusion it would either go to nothing or 1 million+. I got my husband on board by explaining it as best I could and by convincing him to put an amount we could afford to lose. He agreed to let me put some money in and it would be up to me to decide how to manage.

The best thing I ever did was consider that money spent and not obsessing over the price.  When it tanked I was able to say “oh well. Let’s see how it turns out.”  I honestly only check the price when I hear about bitcoin on the news or others talking about it and it has turned out how to be an excellent top indicator for sure. With a long term strategy I never panicked that the top was over because I was in it for the longterm.

I sold some one time to get some expensive equipment for a business/hobby that has brought me great enjoyment and been really great for my family. I don’t regret taking that amount of profit but I would only have done it this once, and again I should have kept investing after. I live like I did before. I drive a 15 year old vehicle, live in modest house, and work full time.

The worst thing I ever did is that I didn’t keep on buying after initial investment. Due to me promising my husband I wouldn’t keep putting more in after initial investment, I missed out on a ton of gains. We could be financially free now instead of just having a really good amount saved. I’m glad I kept my word to him but I could have found other amounts to put in and he would have agreed over the years. Don’t let pride of your entry price stop you from continuing to invest what you can afford (and what you can afford to not touch minimum 4 years).

Now, I have a strategy that I will never go below a certain percentage of my holding, and I will only do so for a couple reasons:

1- to see my husband leave his high stress physically demanding job. He is the hardest worker in the world and I lucked out on him more than I ever did finding bitcoin early. I would love to surprise him by paying off the mortgage without him knowing in advance! I will do this for 20% of my holdings when it gets there. I know it would be better left and the mortgage paid off with fiat, but time with him gained would be worth it.

2- My kids are the best. The oldest is a talented and hard working teen. She spends hours and hours as a ballerina and also earns straight As. She wants to be a surgeon one day and I hope that my investment will be enough to send her to a good university. Right now she is under impression she will have to pay for it all. One other thing is I want more than anything to take her to see her favorite ballerina live before she retires. She also is obsessed with ancient history and particularly Ancient Rome. One day we will do an epic trip to see ruins and different sites. But I will only do this if I can do this with a very small percent of my holding. My other kids are young enough I’m hoping I can have enough when they get to university age.

Best of luck to you all. Keep stacking sats! I’m working on increasing my cost basis and putting in what I can afford.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

As Bitcoiners, we firmly believe in the principles of a free market. We recognize that Bitcoin is the superior asset and that it will naturally prevail over time—but we understand that adoption cannot, and should not, be forced.

This is why I support the idea of a Strategic Crypto Reserve rather than exclusively a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Such a treasury allows the world to transparently observe the U.S. government’s crypto holdings and witness how every asset they hold, apart from Bitcoin, inevitably trends to zero in value against it.

Moreover, it'll show everyone the weaknesses inherent in centralized cryptocurrencies with foundations. These projects will collapse under their own weight, as Machiavellian founders and stakeholders vie for power and control, leading to internal implosions.

Ultimately, this is all part of the process. The free market will reveal Bitcoin’s enduring strength and resilience, while altcoins die off. ",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Get your Strike API here: [https://docs.strike.me/account/dashboard](https://docs.strike.me/account/dashboard)

Download Python and install the requirements from the requirements.txt

create an .env file in the root of the project and add your API key like that:

STRIKE\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key\_here

run both the main.py and worker.py

main.py will initiate the server, while the worker.py will check for paid invoices

I get it if it’s an unusual situation but it feels like people are doing every day tasks while carrying around cold storage wallets.

I bought a Trezor and moved my BTC to it. I put it in a safe place and have never had to get it out again. I send the BTC I purchase weekly to it. I put the seed phrase in a safe spot and I memorized it. The cold storage wallet interface doesn’t matter a whole lot to me cause I rarely ever have to interact with it.

Reddit,bitcoin,Begginer advice,2025-01-24 00:08:49,"First of all, I already know the answer to this question is biased (asking for advice on BTC on BTC sr), but..

I've been following crypto and specially Bitcoin for several years now, but I've never had enough money or courage to invest seriuosly, there was always something coming up that required money from me.

Over the past 6 months, I have accumulated some savings (like 9k). I have already bought 0,01 BTC a few days ago outside from those 9k, just to break the ice and finally get in.

I should also say that I'm completelly new to investing in general, since this is my first investment, and also that I feel really represented by the phylosophy of Bitcoin.

With all that said, what advice/s would you give me? Should I buy more now agressivelly or wait till it comes down a bit? Would you DCA it a fix ammount each month?

Any insights are welcome,
Thank you very much!",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Thoughts?,2025-01-22 10:25:30,"I'm 24 and started DCA'ing 100 EUR/month into Bitcoin for a year now and the more I learn about Bitcoin the more I start to think why I even bother investing in stocks. My stocks are worth around 10K and I'm not doing anything with that money. I still DCA 300 EUR/month in my stock portfolio. Got an emergency fund still on my savings account.

So now I'm thinking to sell it all (or a portion) and put that into Bitcoin, while still DCA'ing, or leave it and swap the amount I'm DCA'ing in stocks into Bitcoin. I could also continue to DCA and wait for a correction to put a big lump sum from my stocks into it.

I'm just not sure if this is my FOMO talking and I'm making a mistake. I see a lot of people here claiming they are 100% in Bitcoin, and a lot of people not believing any of that.

Edit: Didn’t expect so many replies! Thanks a lot to those that took my post seriously and to those that didn’t at all, for a good laugh. I decided I won’t be selling anything, I’ll just switch up my DCA amount between stocks and Bitcoin when the bear market arrives.

school ends in February and I’ll get a job, so I’d put some percentage of my salary in here, like many experienced people online said.. around 10%..

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht might still have around 430 Bitcoin worth over $47 million across several wallets.,2025-01-22 21:42:58,"Recently pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht might still have around 430 Bitcoin worth over $47 million across several wallets. According to blockchain researcher Conor Grogan, he has identified several wallets associated with Ulbricht holding the BTC.

Grogan shared the news on X, noting that these wallets have not been touched in the last 13 years, a sign that the US government did not confiscate them. The US government had recovered around 50,000 Bitcoin from Ulbricht when he was arrested in 2013 for operating the darknet marketplace.

He wrote:

“I found ~430 BTC across dozens of wallets associated with Ross Ulbricht that were not confiscated by the USGovt and have been untouched for 13+ years. Back then these were probably dust wallets, now, collectively, they are worth about $47M.”

However, Grogan added that Ulbricht likely does not have the keys to those wallets, which is why the government could not gain access to them. Still, the uncovering of BTC connected to Ulbricht has led to speculations as to what impact the selling of BTC could have on his pardon. Some users noted that he cannot sell the BTC even if he has the keys since the assets are proceeds from a crime.

Meanwhile, others have criticized Grogan for disclosing the information, noting that the addresses should be kept private. In response, the researcher noted that the addresses are already public as they were cited in the trial documents, and many people are likely tracking them.

Crypto community praises Ross Ulbricht’s release

Still, the crypto community has been celebrating Ross Ulbricht’s release since President Trump announced his full pardon. For many, the decision represents Trump’s commitment to the crypto industry and also vindicates the use of decentralized and privacy-oriented applications. The pardon coincides with the US Court decision to lift the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction on crypto mixer Tornado Cash.

Bitcoin advocate Ben Sigman noted that the Ulbricht release is a major win against government overreach and a well-deserved justice. In a long post on X, Sigman, who wrote the Big Bitcoin Book, defended Ulbricht, noting that while Silk Road might have been problematic, the punishment against him was also disproportionate.

He wrote:

“This isn’t just about Ross or a marketplace—it’s about government overreach and the state’s power to crush individuals with vague laws.”

Others, such as early Bitcoin adopter Jameson Loop, also thanked President Donald Trump for the decision. He wrote:

“Thank you, @POTUS. I hereby grant you a full and unconditional pardon for all past and future shitcoinery.”

With Ulbricht now released, many people have started donating funds to him as he attempts to restart his life. Over $130,000 has been raised through the official Free Ross campaign, with one person recently donating one BTC to the cause. Strike also launched a merch in his honor, with 100% of the proceeds after expenses donated to him.

Meanwhile, not all reactions to his release have been positive. There are several people on X who have questioned his pardon, noting that Ulbricht indeed committed crimes. Some bad actors have also tried to exploit his release to launch memecoins but a statement from his official X account already denied any affiliation with a memecoin.

It had its peak and I didn’t sell. It then went on to fall and has appeared to do pretty much nothing ever since. If it’s likely to be over I’ll probably move it over to another coin.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Algorand Staking Rewards go live tomorrow (1/23/2025). You can now run a node and get rewarded! No slashing risk! No lockup period! Real-time, auto-compounding rewards! Every block proposed will pay out 10 ALGO + 50% of block transaction fees.",2025-01-23 02:10:19,"Tomorrow marks a titanic shift in the future of Algorand and decentralization. This is one of the biggest updates in Algorand history. The network will now reward participants who propose blocks! Algorand is unique because of the following:

* **No slashing risk**
   * Staked Algo is not subject to slashing. Instead, ineffective nodes are algorithmically removed from consensus and simply forgo rewards.
* **No lockup period**
   * On Algorand, independent validators maintain control of their Algo at all times. Staked tokens remain in a user’s wallet while securing the network as part of consensus.
* **Low cost**
   * Running a node on Algorand is extremely cheap. All you need is a computer with 16GB of RAM, fast SSD, and 1 Gbps internet connection.
* **Real-time rewards**
   * The initial rewards for block proposers are 10 Algo + 50% of txn fees per block. On Algorand, rewards are paid out as each block is finalized, every 2.8 seconds, and your stake automatically compounds, instantly increasing your voting power.

**Why is this huge?**

This will make Algorand one of the most **egalitarian**, **democratic**, and **decentralized** blockchains in the world. You don't need a data center or crazy hardware to run a node. Anyone can run one on a mediocre laptop or minipc! Algorand to me lives up to the ideals of Satoshi, anyone, anywhere can help secure the chain and liberate themselves from the shackles of traditional finance. This brings us one step closer to the dream of a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Now, lets get into the weeds!

Recommended system specification for **participation** nodes is:

* 8 vCPU
* 16 GB RAM
* 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
* 1 Gbps connection with low latency

Personally I run my own on a Beelink Minipc and it runs flawlessly (https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs). Please note, this is above the required specs and you can find cheaper ones that will run flawlessly.

There will be many options for node running depending on whether you have access to the required hardware and ALGO requirements.

1. **Solo staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * By running an Algorand node you become an active contributor to this decentralized system. Your node, acting as an independent validator, helps prevent fraudulent activity and ensures only valid transactions are added to the blockchain. Node runners contribute to ensuring the robustness of Algorand infrastructure which benefits developers, applications, and users across the ecosystem.Participating nodes also have voting rights on network proposals, allowing you to have a direct say in Algorand’s future development.
2. **Liquid staking (any Algo amount)**
   * Liquid staking applications allow users to stake their Algo while maintaining liquidity. While each platform is unique, the typical process asks users to deposit Algo and mint new tokens that represent the ownership and value of the staked Algo and can be used across the [DeFi ecosystem](https://algorand.co/ecosystem/defi). 
3. **Staking pools (any Algo amount)**
   * Staking pools enable groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to stake their Algo to a validator and get rewarded based on the rewards the validator receives. Unique staking options are also available, such as staking via DEX liquidity pools (which requires committing Algo plus another asset). 
4. **Delegated staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * Delegated staking involves utilizing a third-party to run a node on the your behalf while your Algo remains your wallet at all times. This provides an option for users who want to help secure the network and collect rewards, but don’t have the knowledge or resources to run their own node.

If you choose to run your own node, there are many different options for getting your node up and running. From command line interface purism to one-click solutions. Currently, I use FUNC, which is a one click option for Windows that is extremely simple and easy.

* https://algorand.co/run-a-node
   * Nodekit (https://nodekit.run/)
   * FUNC (https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func)
   * A1C (https://github.com/AustP/austs-one-click-node/releases)
   * Manuel Installation (https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/)

The minimum amount needed to run your own node and get rewards is 30,000 ALGO. Keep in mind, you can still run your own node with a lower amount, **as little as .1 ALGO**, you just will not get rewarded.

If you don't have the required 30,000 ALGO you can put your ALGO in a liquid staking pool and get rewards. There will be many different platforms to do so. Below is a non-exhaustive list.

* Pera Algo Wallet (https://perawallet.app/?download=true)
* Folks Finance (https://app.folks.finance/liquid-staking)
* Tinyman (https://app.tinyman.org/liquid-stake)
* Pact (https://www.pact.fi/)
* CompX (https://app.compx.io/staking-pools)
* Messina One (https://messina.one/liquid-staking)
* Valar (https://stake.valar.solutions/)



You will also have the ability to setup your OWN pools and let people stake to your pools via Reti Pooling. The Réti Pooling protocol facilitates the creation of decentralized staking pools on the Algorand network, enabling groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to trustlessly stake to a Validator and earn yield based on the rewards the Validator receives.

* [https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme](https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme)
* [https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti](https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti)



I also assume the major exchanges will allow you to earn a percentage back on any ALGO you keep on an exchange.

Help be a part of decentralizing Algorand and get paid in the process!

**Exciting times are ahead! I hope you're Reti!**

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Future of AI in Fintech: HPL and mAInd - A Bullish Outlook,2025-01-23 21:03:10,"I recently stumbled upon an intriguing X (formerly Twitter) thread between TheRoaringAI and fintechjunkie discussing the potential of Human Programming Language (HPL) and its application within an AI system called mAInd. Here's why I'm absolutely bullish on this development:

1. **Innovative Approach to AI**: TheRoaringAI's work on HPL isn't just about programming AI to influence human behavior; it's about understanding human actions to predict future trends. This bidirectional approach could revolutionize how we use AI in fintech for predictive analytics, making investment decisions more informed and proactive.
2. **Real-World Application**: The conversation highlighted that HPL is not just theoretical. TheRoaringAI pointed out that fintechjunkie's engagement serves as a practical example of HPL in action, proving its viability. This real-world application signals that we're on the brink of seeing AI tools that can shape financial markets by anticipating consumer behavior and market trends.
3. **Potential for Market Disruption**: With mAInd, AI doesn't just react to market trends but shapes them. Imagine AI systems that can guide investment strategies, optimize trading algorithms, or even influence consumer financial habits towards more sustainable or profitable outcomes. This is game-changing for fintech, offering a competitive edge to those who adopt this technology early.
4. **Community Engagement**: The interaction shows a vibrant community of experts like fintechjunkie who are eager to discuss, debate, and develop these concepts further. This level of engagement from industry insiders suggests a strong foundation of support and interest, which bodes well for the technology's adoption and evolution.
5. **Investment Opportunity**: For investors, this could represent a significant opportunity. Companies that leverage HPL and mAInd could lead the next wave of fintech innovation, potentially becoming the next big names in the sector. Watching this space could be crucial for those looking to invest in cutting-edge technology with broad applications.

I'm super excited about where this could go. The blend of AI with human behavior analysis through HPL could redefine financial services, making them more personalized, predictive, and powerful. Let's keep an eye on TheRoaringAI and fintechjunkie for more insights, as their work might just be the catalyst for the next fintech boom!

What do you all think? Could HPL and mAInd be the future of fintech? Let's discuss!",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Etherealize: The Catalyst Ethereum (ETH) Needs for Institutional Adoption - Could This Send ETH to New Heights?,2025-01-23 07:05:43,"Have you heard about the [announcement ](https://x.com/Etherealize_io/status/1882213980858642599)from Etherealize? Looks like a new initiative appeared in Ethereum ecosystem and that it could be a game changer for Ethereum! This initiative goal is to help TradFi to join crypto and accelerate Ethereum institutional adoption and position to become the backbone of the future economy. 

[Etherealize X account](https://preview.redd.it/296vioj70pee1.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d08dd10d2e8d6ccf2a38a611b4c59c89f299f2d)

In the thread they said that they are going to educate institutions, ETF issuers and expand to the worlds Ethereum's potential. They also claim that they are building a product for institutions to tokenize and trade assets on Ethereum. Quite big project because RWAs are the future and will bring a lot of adoption. They are also going to focus on adding more ETH vocal advocates to increase the momentum.

They also talk about the team which is quite impressive. All of them combined have 200+ years of Wall Street and crypto experience so they are not noobs and know and like the ecosystem.

I believe this is quite bullish because finally someone is going to start to do some ""real"" marketing with Ethereum convincing institutions to use it more that is where real money is.

So, I’ve decided: no more portfolio-checking until March 27th. That’s the day I’ll decide whether to sell everything or hold on. Until then, I’ll stick to Reddit, trying to guess whether I’m losing money or gaining, but I won't open any portfolio.

End of March might be a reasonable time in a bull market... or it might be way too early or even too late. Who knows? In the meantime, I’ll focus on training, bettering myself, and spending time with friends.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Do you think mass adoption is possible?,2025-01-22 23:14:41,"With the news of even further Bitcoin purchases by MicroStrategy, the Bank of America seeming to welcome getting involved with Cryptocurrency it’s got me wondering if it’s a step closer to mass adoption or if that’s never going to happen.

I’ve mostly used cryptocurrency as a way to make a little more money, in the same way as a stock or share. I’ve never seen a desire to use it to spend in any form and still think at the moment fiat is the option for that. If anything I’d lose money I think using it to spend with.

However having an establishment as big and integral to American society as the Bank of America getting involved in any sense for me is also a positive sign. Whether is because they want to make money or not, having an institution like that behind Cryptocurrency would add some trust to the general population over it.

I feel for any mass adoption it needs banks and governments (and really a bit Western nation, not El Salvador respectfully) to get behind it so that the population can have trust and also protection from scams which are becoming more of a thing. That said these players getting involved are directly against what the point of Cryptocurrency was created for as I understand.

But then I wonder, despite the technology behind it being fantastic, if cryptocurrency isn’t going to easily transform the day to day lives of a normal person over fiat, it will never  see mass adoption and I struggle currently to see as to why that would occur. It seems most people have it to basically get richer from it?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Very Bullish Forbes Article “Nations States Turn To Bitcoin As A Strategic Reserve Asset“. Quote from article: “Bitcoin has become more than an economic instrument; it is a symbol of progress, sovereignty, and the transformation of the global financial system.“",2025-01-22 15:56:41,">In 2025, Bitcoin has transcended its origins as a niche investment, emerging as a powerful geopolitical asset. Governments and central banks from Washington to Zurich are actively discussing its potential role in national reserves, seeing it as a challenger to traditional reserve assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin's limited supply, decentralization, and growing adoption have positioned it as a force capable of reshaping the global monetary order.

>Under the Trump administration, the U.S. government's stance on Bitcoin has undergone a significant transformation. Once skeptical, President-elect Donald Trump has expressed strong support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Plans for the creation of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve to bolster economic stability have been outlined, signaling a shift in how the administration views the cryptocurrency. Advocates within Congress, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, argue that Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it an ideal hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar. Although skeptics remain, the momentum behind this proposal is undeniable.

>Switzerland, renowned for its neutrality and financial acumen, is considering a similar move. The Swiss National Bank is exploring the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its reserves alongside gold. A public referendum may soon make Switzerland the first nation to officially adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This initiative aligns with Switzerland's tradition of innovation and financial independence, setting a potential precedent for other nations.

>The growing interest in Bitcoin by governments has led to what some describe as ""The Domino Effect."" Once one nation adopts Bitcoin, others may feel compelled to follow suit to avoid being left behind in an increasingly digitized financial landscape. This ""fear of missing out"" is no longer confined to retail investors but has become a powerful motivator for governments as well. Early adopters of Bitcoin stand to gain a strategic edge, solidifying their positions in a transforming global financial system.

>This competitive dynamic mirrors the nuclear arms race of the 20th century in its intensity and implications. While Bitcoin lacks the destructive potential of nuclear weapons, the stakes remain high: countries that fail to act risk being sidelined as Bitcoin becomes ingrained in the global financial system. Those who hesitate could find themselves at an economic disadvantage, unable to leverage the advantages of decentralized digital reserves.

>The interest in Bitcoin extends beyond the United States and Switzerland. Countries like Germany, Hong Kong, Russia, Brazil, and Poland are exploring its potential as a strategic asset, each driven by unique economic and political motivations. In Germany, former Finance Minister Christian Lindner has advocated for the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank to consider Bitcoin as a means to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Similarly, Hong Kong legislator Wu Jiezhuang has called for Bitcoin's integration into the city’s financial reserves, emphasizing its potential to enhance economic resilience and stability. Wu has noted that smaller nations and some U.S. states have already diversified their reserves with Bitcoin, suggesting a growing trend toward its adoption.

>Russia has also begun incorporating Bitcoin and other digital currencies into its international transactions, aiming to bypass Western sanctions and reduce dependence on the dollar. Russian companies have started utilizing domestically mined Bitcoin for foreign trade, and President Vladimir Putin has expressed support for digital currencies as alternatives to the traditional financial system. This move demonstrates Russia's effort to diversify its financial strategies and regain economic autonomy in a volatile global environment.

>In South America, Brazil has launched the Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (RESBit), a bold initiative to allocate a portion of its international reserves to Bitcoin. Brazil hopes to position itself as a leader in financial innovation, diversifying its reserves while enhancing economic independence. Meanwhile, Poland is considering the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve to strengthen its digital finance sector. Presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen has proposed transforming Poland into a hub for Bitcoin by implementing favorable regulations, low taxes, and strong collaboration with banks and regulators.

>Bitcoin’s significance extends beyond its role as a financial asset; it symbolizes freedom and decentralization. Its adoption by nation-states reflects a commitment to innovation and independence, challenging even authoritarian regimes to embrace its principles. As central banks face mounting pressures from inflation and debt crises, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset continues to grow. Although the Bank for International Settlements has imposed limits on crypto exposure, demand for decentralized reserves remains strong.

>The Trump administration, Switzerland, and other nations exploring Bitcoin reserves are laying the groundwork for a new financial framework. The race is on, and those who act swiftly may gain a lasting advantage. Governments hesitant to adopt Bitcoin risk being left behind in a world where Bitcoin increasingly sets the rules. This dynamic underscores the need for nations to seek alternative pathways to economic independence, moving away from complex and contentious traditional financial tools.

>As of 2025, the question is no longer whether Bitcoin will be part of national reserves or shape global geopolitics. Instead, the focus has shifted to understanding how much of a central role it will play in future economic strategies. Bitcoin has become more than an economic instrument; it is a symbol of progress, sovereignty, and the transformation of the global financial system. For those willing to embrace it, the opportunities are vast. For those who resist, the cost may be irrelevance in a rapidly evolving monetary landscape.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Questions on creating a crypto casino website,2025-01-23 02:54:54,"Sorry for the multiple posts but they were not showing up, so trying again without links...

I'm working on a crypto casino website and wondering how, or if I should, sync it to a blockchain for the bets to be publicly stored/shared. So maybe the question is, to DApp or not to DApp?

I have it working locally by storing bet information in a SQLite database and a work in progress local blockchain, but for production will need to use real currency synced to users wallets. **TL;DR** of how the website works:

* Users place their bets
* The bet amount is taken from the user and stored in a separate wallet
* Once the bet is resolved, the winnings are taken out of the separate wallet and sent to the winning user

Looking at other DApp gambling sites where you can connect a wallet to place bets and showing all the live bets with the win amount, or where you can enter your wallet address to place a bet. Both are examples of what I'm trying to do.

Since there are a lot of sketchy crypto casinos out there, I'm trying to include features to make people feel secure in using the site. So I guess my questions would be:

* Is this something that *should* be a DApp?
* If so, any resources/guides on how I would implement this? Including:
   * How to connect wallets and/or allowing to place a bet via entering a wallet address
   * Showing the live resolved and pending bets
   * Storing the users bets in a separate wallet and then sending from that wallet to users",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"With Solana doing everything better, faster and cheaper, what's the point of Ethereum?",2025-01-23 18:56:47,"Other than Bitcoin, no crypto can make the decentralized argument. Almost all of them either fail to differentiate from Bitcoin or have not proven to have a use case despite much hype and lot of marketing.

We have the neutral, mathematically sound, energy currency for the world. The question now is can crypto do something else? I don't think it's certain that tokenization is a legitimate use case beyond speculation. Remember that even the concept of tokenization and Dex originally came from Bitcoin layers like Mastercoin and Omni first and failed to find a market long before the altcoin bubble of 2017.

Since then, we haven't seen any new innovation in crypto. People just jump from one memecoin to next. One of the most innovative projects has actually been MOONS! It has some social use cases as a community token, is arguably more decentralized since Reddit burned its stake and simply lacks awareness at this time.

For those who believe tokenization and Dex have potential beyond memecoins, isn't Solana a FAR better alternative to Ethereum. Compared to Bitcoin, neither is even remotely decentralized but they shouldn't be compared to Bitcoin. They should be compared to each other based on usability. Solana is undeniably faster and more usable than Ethereum.

In this day and age, Ethereum just feels like a turgid outdated monstrosity caught between trying (and failing) to be ""world computer"" and then trying (and failing) to rebrand itself as a competitor to Bitcoin as sound money, which is a preposterous notion.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

I am wondering for any information on the security of SHA3 and its sponge function versus older hash functions like MD5, SHA1, SHA2.

What makes it more secure? How heavily studied has it been. The sponge function is still newer than the other constructions but its internal state is quite large.

I am looking for hash functions with good security margins.

BLAKE2 and SHA3 are so far the best looking but is there any reason I should look at SHA2 again because it’s well studied.

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,crypto,Storing libsodium private keys on disk,2024-12-27 19:31:38,"Hi everyone,

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

Reddit,crypto,How to apply Pohlig Hellman using a very limited set of auxiliary inputs in that case ?,2024-11-04 15:25:21,"So I was reading about [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1321). The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2025-01-24 00:51:29.537650

2 Private keys x1 & x2, corresponding Public Keys P1 = x1G & P2 = x2G.

Now P = P1 + P2 is also a public key with corresponding private key x = x1 + x2.

If I sign (Schnorr Signature) with x, does it only prove possession of the private key corresponding to P or does it also prove possession of the 2 individual public keys x1 & x2? Or if not proof of possession of both x1 & x2, does it atleast prove something more than just x?
