According to a popular crypto pundit, the meme coin appears not to be done yet, as it readies itself for another move to the upside. Here’s Why $0.169 Could Be Pivotal To DOGE’s Future In a new post on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has put forward an exciting outlook for the price of Dogecoin over the next couple of days. According to the market expert, the largest meme coin looks primed to cross the $0.2 landmark as the month of November drags on. This bullish projection is based on the formation of a bull flag pattern on the Dogecoin four-hour chart. The bull flag is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a period of steady upward movement (the flagpole) followed by a short period of price consolidation or slight downward movement (the flag). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Correction Triggers $296 Million In Liquidations – Can BTC Still Hit ATH? Typically, the bull flag is an excellent upward continuation pattern that could suggest the persistence of a positive run. The trick is to wait for the breakout of the flag (the price consolidation) before confirming the continuation of the upward trend. This breakout from the flag often results in a move higher, usually measuring the length of the prior flag pole. According to Martinez, this pattern appears to be playing out on the Dogecoin four-hour chart, with the trigger point lying around the $0.169 mark. The analyst noted that there is a major resistance around $0.168 and a successful close above this region could see the DOGE price run up towards its 2024 high. Using the length of the first flagpole, the price target for Dogecoin is placed at around $0.209, which would represent a 29% rally from the current price point. While a move to $0.209 would reflect a major leap in the meme coin’s price trajectory, DOGE would still be about 250% adrift of its all-time high price of $0.7316. Dogecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Dogecoin stands at around $0.1603, reflecting a mere 1.1% in the past day. While the meme coin seems to have slowed down in the last 24 hours, its weekly performance still places it amongst the best-performing assets in recent weeks. According to data from CoinGecko, the DOGE price is up by nearly 20% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH?

Ethereum Could Crash Over 60%, Analyst Says",2024-11-02 22:30:52+00:00,"Like most digital assets, Ethereum witnessed a correction this week by losing over 5% in the last 24 hours while trading just above $2,500. While the increased on-chain activity could eventually make the bulls bet for the bounce back of Ether, a few experts differ with this perspective. Crypto veteran analyst Peter Brandt predicts further downfall in Ether to the extent of loss of over 60% from its present price, with no indication of changing. Currently, Ether is trading at a 42-month low. While Bitcoin re-tested the $70k mark early this week, Ether maintains a sluggish price action and is too far off from the experts’ target of $4k.

Ether’s Strong Bearish Movement Ethereum trades at its 42-month low against the world’s top digital asset, which suggests a bearish momentum.

According to Brandt, Ethereum’s bearish sentiment will continue with no reassuring signs of reversal. Interesting to note that there was not a buy signal in $ETH In fact, chart remains bearish with unmet target at 1551 pic.twitter.com/sjkXyTQXU2 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 31, 2024 In a Twitter/X post, Brandt shared a graph saying there’s no but signal for Ether. He added that Ethereum’s chart is bearish, with the bulls making it difficult to hit the $1,551 target. The 1-day-chart highlights the asset’s continued bearish moment momentum that started last August, characterized by a descending channel. Ethereum’s bearish flag is terrible news for traders and holders, suggesting a continued downtrend. Analyst Sees Bearish Metrics For Ethereum Aside from the bearish signals on the graph, Brandt also noted a few discouraging metrics for Ethereum. For example, Ether has dropped by over 5% over the last 24 hours, registering a sharper decline than Solana, at -4.91%, and Bitcoin, at -3.87%. Also, Brandt noted that the ETH/BTC trading ratio dipped to 0.03613, a 42-month low, as BTC continues to lead the broader crypto market. Although Ethereum is currently priced at $2,507, Brandt sees the asset dipping even further to $1,551, reflecting a possible 62% decline from its current value. $1,551 As Ethereum’s Unmet Target Brandt sees $1,551 as the asset’s unmet target and a key milestone. In his analysis, this level serves as the holders’ point of capitulation. The recent dips in price have affected investors’ and holders’ confidence, with Ethereum struggling to sustain the $2,400 support.

However, Brandt offers a more bearish outlook for Ethereum, saying that the asset will go downhill unless a new set of technical indicators emerges.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Flashes Buy Signal After Price Closed 2nd Green Month Candle In A Row,2024-11-02 21:00:31+00:00,"The Bitcoin price enjoyed its second consecutive green candle in October after closing the month with a 10% price gain. Crypto analyst TradingShot revealed why this development was a positive going forward and is a good buy signal for those looking to invest in the flagship crypto.  Related Reading: Ethereum Claims Address Dominance With 43% Lead—Will It Keep Rising? Bitcoin Triggers Buy Signal After Price Hit Second Green Month Candle  TradingShot mentioned in a TradingView post that it is always a good signal to buy whenever the Bitcoin price closes two consecutive green monthly candles. He made this assertion based on the multi-year chart, which he also claimed shows that the market continues to rally whenever Bitcoin records these two straight green candles.  The crypto analyst revealed that the Bitcoin price recorded three straight green candle occasions and a clear accumulation phase in the 2021 bull run. Meanwhile, in the 2017 bull run, the Bitcoin price recorded numerous straight green candle occasions. This market cycle looks to be replicating the 2021 bull run pattern, as BTC recorded three straight monthly green candles between January and March earlier this year before it recorded an accumulation phase.  Therefore, as TradingShot explained, this is likely a good buying opportunity since the Bitcoin price could record a third straight monthly green candle in November. Another reason why Bitcoin would likely experience a monthly green candle in November is because the flagship crypto has enjoyed monthly positive returns most of the time it closed October in the green.  The Bitcoin price outlook for November also looks bullish because of the upcoming US elections. The aftermath of the elections is expected to bring certainty to the market, which could cause Bitcoin to rally. Economist Alex Krüger predicted that the BTC could rally quickly to $90,000 if Donald Trump wins. Meanwhile, he mentioned that there is a chance that the flagship crypto could drop to as low as $65,000.  Price Needs To Stay Above $69,000 In The Meantime In an X post, popular analyst Justin Bennett mentioned that the drop in Bitcoin’s price below $70,000 isn’t a good look, but the Bulls’ last line of defense is $69,000. He remarked that the $65,000 lows are next if that price level fails to hold on the high time frames.  Justin Bennett added that he doubts that the equal highs from March and October near $73,700 will go unchallenged. However, before that happens, he suggested that the Bitcoin price could retest the lows at around $65,000.  Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also revealed that the Bitcoin price needs to hold above $69,000 to reach a new all-time high (ATH). He predicted that BTC could rally to $78,000 if the $69,000 level holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,FLOKI Faces Downside Risks: $0.000110 Support Level Under Scrutiny,2024-11-02 19:30:46+00:00,"FLOKI is navigating a critical moment as technical indicators flash bearish signals, raising concerns over its ability to maintain support at $0.000110. With downward momentum building and sellers gaining strength, this support level has become a focal point for traders watching for signs of stability or further decline. As the market turns cautious, the strength of FLOKI’s support will be crucial in determining its next move and whether it can withstand the current downtrend. This analysis aims to assess the current technical indicators signaling bearish pressure for FLOKI and evaluate the potential resilience of the $0.000110 support level. By examining key indicators and market dynamics, this piece aims to provide insight into whether the meme coin can hold steady at this critical threshold or if further downside risks loom. Is FLOKI’s $0.000110 Support In Danger? On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI is exhibiting negative momentum, trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward toward the $0.000110 support level. A continued descent toward this support suggests that selling pressure is intensifying, and if the support fails to hold, FLOKI could experience more declines. Also, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for FLOKI indicates bearish movement, with the signal line crossing below the SMA line and dropping below the zero line. This shift suggests increasing selling pressure, favoring sellers and raising concerns about potential further declines in price. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details On the daily chart, the meme coin displays significant downward momentum, highlighted by a series of bearish candlestick patterns that have emerged following a failed recovery attempt. The inability to sustain upward movement after the recovery attempt suggests a lack of buyer confidence and a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. As FLOKI trends toward this support level, the pressure from sellers could intensify, raising concerns about the possibility of a breakdown. A thorough examination of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that the asset is positioned for possible extended losses. The signal line has crossed below the SMA line and is trending downward beneath the zero line, signaling a notable shift in momentum toward the negative. If this downward trend continues, FLOKI may face substantial challenges in regaining upward traction, leading to an extended period of diminished price movement and increased bearish sentiment in the market. Testing Times Ahead For FLOKI FLOKI is nearing a pivotal point as it approaches the $0.000110 support level. If the asset breaks this critical threshold, it could trigger an additional decline, potentially leading the price down to the $0.00005381 level and other subsequent support areas. Related Reading: Floki Bullish Breakout Ignites: Could A 96% Surge Be Next? Conversely, should the meme coin manage to hold the $0.000110 support level, it could establish a base for a possible rebound, paving the way for a price increase toward the $0.0002105 mark and other resistance levels.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Analyst Reveals Why Bitcoin Price Crashed From $73,000 To $69,000",2024-11-02 18:00:08+00:00,"November began with an unexpected downturn in the crypto market as Bitcoin, which had gone on a bull run in the last week of October, rapidly lost its momentum. The highly anticipated “Moonvember” kicked off with an unexpected crash, plummeting from $73,000 on October 31 to $69,000 on November 1 to essentially wipe out $296 million in liquidations, with the majority of them being long positions. Despite the bulls managing to steady a Bitcoin price support at $69,000, the rapid downturn stirred questions among many crypto traders. Related Reading: Ethereum Claims Address Dominance With 43% Lead—Will It Keep Rising? According to crypto expert Ash Crypto on social media platform X, this quick crash in the Bitcoin price can be attributed to four major factors.  Key Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Price Drop According to Ash Crypto, the recent Bitcoin price isn’t a straightforward result of crypto-specific events but rather a reflection of the broader economic landscape. As he noted, there are currently multiple reports suggesting that Iran may be planning a military action against Israel from Iraqi territory. The potential escalation of conflict in the region seemed to have created uncertainty among Bitcoin investors, and many might have opted to exit from the markets. “As we all know, war is bad for Bitcoin and crypto,” the analyst said. Aside from the brewing conflict, Ash Crypto also highlighted the recent earnings reports from tech giants as another factor in the Bitcoin price crash. Major tech companies like Microsoft and Meta recently posted earnings reports that, despite beating expectations, showed rising AI-related costs. This led to a downturn in many other tech stocks, which spilled over to other financial markets, including the crypto industry. Another factor Ash Crypto highlighted is the recent climb in US Treasury’s bond yields, specifically the 10-year note, which is now trading above 4.3%. Higher yields make government bonds a more attractive alternative, making investors less likely to invest in more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies.   Lastly, the latest Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) reading increased slightly above 2.7%. Ash Crypto noted that this rise in core inflation could push the Federal Reserve toward a more hawkish stance. This could lead to the Fed adopting higher interest rates or delaying rate cuts. Both scenarios could dampen demand for Bitcoin, which thrives in low interest rates, as shown by the September 18 interest rate cut. Looking Ahead: What’s Next For Bitcoin? Like many other crypto analysts, Ash Crypto remains confident that Bitcoin’s latest dip is only temporary. He drew parallels to October’s initial market dip, while anticipating that November, or “Moonvember,” will follow a similar trajectory. Interestingly, the analyst believes Bitcoin still has the momentum and market interest needed to push past $80,000 before the end of November.

This level is pivotal for SOL, as losing it could trigger a deeper correction, putting the altcoin at risk of further downside.  However, prominent analyst Carl Runefelt has shared technical analysis indicating that Solana may be primed for a brief correction before staging a rally to retest local highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? Runefelt’s analysis highlights signs of renewed strength for SOL, suggesting that the altcoin is preparing for a move that could challenge recent highs within the next few days. This bullish setup depends heavily on Solana maintaining support at $165, which could act as a launchpad for further upward momentum.  As the crypto market closely watches Bitcoin’s bid for a new all-time high, Solana investors are bracing for potential volatility. In this uncertain landscape, Solana remains a focal point for investors who see an opportunity if support holds steady.  Solana Holding Key Demand Level Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the stronger-performing altcoins this cycle, drawing significant attention as it tests a key demand level that could drive it toward new highs. Prominent analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, indicating that SOL may briefly dip to around $160 before staging a push to retest its recent high at $180. According to Runefelt, this $160 level represents a critical support zone for Solana, as holding above it is essential to sustain the altcoin’s bullish momentum and confirm its ongoing uptrend. Runefelt’s analysis emphasizes the importance of this support level in fueling Solana’s potential for gains, suggesting that it could serve as a springboard for a substantial rally.  If SOL successfully holds above $160, a surge to test local highs would not only reinforce confidence among investors but also set the stage for Solana to push into new territory if broader market conditions remain favorable. The coming week could prove pivotal for SOL as the market braces for heightened volatility with the US election on the horizon (Nov 5) and Bitcoin nearing its all-time high. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? As investors monitor macro events and Bitcoin’s movements closely, Solana’s technical setup around $160 will be a focal point for those seeking to capitalize on the altcoin’s potential gains. If Solana maintains its bullish structure, it could play a key role in leading the altcoin market forward in this cycle. SOL Technical Levels To Watch Solana is trading at $166 after a slight rebound from the $163 level, maintaining a strong position above the critical $160 support zone. This level has proven to be a vital threshold for SOL, as a sustained hold here could set the stage for a rally toward higher resistance levels.  If buyers successfully defend $160, it may serve as the foundation for a climb to $183 and potentially beyond, with higher supply zones likely to be tested. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Near ATH – Volume Suggests A Big Move Ahead Analysts are watching this level closely, as it could either reinforce SOL’s bullish structure or signal the need for further consolidation. A breakdown below $160, however, would likely lead to a deeper correction, prompting traders to recalibrate their expectations as Solana seeks lower support levels. The next few days will be crucial as the market evaluates SOL’s strength at $160 and prepares for potential moves to new highs.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin ETFs Crucial To Sustain Current Buying Pressure – Details,2024-11-02 15:00:07+00:00,"The price of Bitcoin recorded significant leaps in the past month rising by 14.74% according to data from CoinMarketCap. During this price rally, the premier cryptocurrency came close to establishing a new market all-time high, reaching a local peak of $73,149 on October 29. Interestingly, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has stated a certain condition needed to sustain this price gain. Related Reading: Tracking Bitcoin’s Profit Cycles: Could A New Market High Be Near? Low Stablecoin Exchange Reserve Provides Need For Bitcoin ETFs In a series of X posts on November 1, Ki Young Ju stated that stablecoins currently provide an insufficient amount of liquidity to sustain the present buying pressure on Bitcoin. This observation is particularly important as traders commonly rely on stablecoins to acquire volatile assets such as Bitcoin, due to their fixed dollar value. Therefore, a higher stablecoin exchange reserve translates into significant potential for an impending price gain via wide-scale purchase. However, According to Young Ju, crypto exchanges currently hold only 21% of the total stablecoin market i.e. $34 billion of $166 billion, as most of these tokens are currently being used for storage or remittances. This development represents a slow rise in the stablecoin exchange reserve of $30 billion recorded in September 2021 during the last bull run, despite a 33% growth in total stablecoin shares in the same period. Currently, the Bitcoin-to-stablecoin reserve ratio is 6.05, similar to the value seen at the last ATH. Therefore, in order to maintain BTC’s present upward trajectory, Ki Young Ju postulates that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, alongside Coinbase USD reserves, have to provide much-needed market liquidity.  Notably, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs can be said to be behind Bitcoin’s current rally considering their impressive inflows record of over $5 billion in the past three weeks. Of this figure, BlackRock’s IBIT has led the market recording investments of $4.44 billion in this timeframe. Ki Young Ju states that it is important the Bitcoin ETFs maintain this momentum as a breakdown in pace will reduce buying pressure, especially from brokerage firms such as Coinbase Prime, which may result in Bitcoin falling back into consolidation.

However, the asset’s trading volume is up by 25.61% and is valued at $51.56 billion. For the premier cryptocurrency, a return to above $73,000 remains much on the card, especially with the potential of sustained ETF flows and the upcoming US elections. If pro-crypto Donald Trump secures a victory on the ballot, Bitcoin should definitely establish a new all-time high with expectations of reaching $90,000-$100,000 at the end of 2024.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL?,2024-11-02 13:30:09+00:00,"Bitcoin is showing resilience, holding firm above the $69,000 mark after a slight pullback from recent local highs at $73,600. Following weeks of bullish momentum and nearing its all-time high, BTC has settled just below the critical $73,794 resistance, a key level that, if surpassed, would push the cryptocurrency into price discovery mode.  According to data from CryptoQuant, short-term holders are experiencing a net profit-to-loss of negative 20 BTC, indicating a wave of panic selling among retail investors. This type of behavior, often driven by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), can precede a significant price surge as stronger hands accumulate BTC at lower prices. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? Historically, similar sell-offs by retail investors have been followed by renewed upward momentum as longer-term holders seize the opportunity to enter or reinforce their positions. If Bitcoin can maintain support above $69,000, the odds of a breakout past its all-time high increase substantially.  Market watchers are now closely monitoring the resistance level, as surpassing it could trigger a wave of buying interest and push BTC into new highs. The coming days may prove crucial, setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next big move. Bitcoin Weak Hands Selling Bitcoin recently attempted a breakthrough to new heights but failed to breach its all-time high of $73,794, entering a consolidation phase as the market eyes key events: next week’s U.S. election and the Federal Reserve’s anticipated interest rate decision.  CryptoQuant’s recent data, shared by analyst Axel Adler on X, points to a noteworthy trend among short-term BTC holders. The net profit-to-loss ratio for these holders shows a negative balance of -20 BTC, indicating a wave of panic selling following Bitcoin’s struggle to establish new highs. This sell-off among short-term investors, who tend to react more quickly to market volatility, suggests some caution amid uncertainty. Adler emphasizes that in such turbulent times, a long-term “HODL” (hold on for dear life) approach can be the most beneficial strategy. Holding strong through market noise has historically rewarded BTC investors who keep their positions intact during periods of retracement and heightened volatility.  With Bitcoin’s all-time high in sight, a successful breakout would likely signal the beginning of a broad market bull run. The coming days are critical as Bitcoin sits at a pivotal point in its cycle, balancing between strong consolidation and the possibility of explosive growth.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? The influence of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, paired with potential election outcomes, could create the market conditions needed for BTC to push past its all-time high. If this level is breached, it would not only affirm a bullish outlook for BTC but likely set off a rally across the entire cryptocurrency market.  BTC Holding Above Key Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $69,620 following a retrace from its recent high near $73,600. Despite this pullback, bulls remain in control as BTC holds firmly above the crucial $69,000 support level—a price point that acted as resistance since late July. This level has now transformed into strong support, bolstering bullish sentiment in the market. If Bitcoin holds above $69,000, a renewed push above all-time highs seems likely. Breaking this resistance would propel BTC into uncharted territory, potentially sparking a fresh wave of bullish momentum and price discovery. However, if the price dips below this mark, it could signal a need for a more significant correction to gather enough buying power for the next move up.

For now, Bitcoin’s price structure remains strong, and as long as this support holds, the market anticipates further upside momentum in the coming days. Bulls are closely watching this level, as it may define the next phase of Bitcoin’s bull run. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum Must Stay Above $2,480 For This Bullish Signal To Hold True – Analyst",2024-11-02 12:00:20+00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) exhibited a dual-phased market movement in the last week rising by over 9% to reach a local peak of $2,711 on October 30, before declining by an almost similar measure. As the prominent altcoin now hovers around the $2,500 price mark, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted an important market condition that could ignite a price rebound. Related Reading: Ethereum Blobs Are ‘Insanely Bullish” For ETH Price: Breakthrough Research Ethereum Buy Signal Subject To Vital Price Support In an X post on November 1, Martinez stated that TD Sequential has indicated a buy signal on the ETH 4-hour chart. For context, the TD Sequential commonly used trading indicator to signal potential turning points in price trends and provide signals for trend exhaustion or potential price reversals.  Following Ethereum’s decline over the past 48 hours, TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal, indicating a possible price recovery on the horizon. However, Martinez states that for this bullish signal to prove true, Ethereum must remain above the $2,480 support zone. A potential price drop below this support level would result in a further decline to $2,200, indicating a potential 12% decrease from the token’s current price. However, Ethereum is expected to rebound to around $2,700 if the specified support zone holds.   Interestingly, fellow market analyst Michaël van de Poppe has provided some valuable insights into Ethereum’s price if this successful price recovery occurs. In a post on X, van de Poppe applauds the resilience of Ethereum despite the rise in US permanent job losses as revealed by the recent unemployment data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He also notes ETH has been a range-bound market oscillating between $2,200-$2,700 since August. However, van de Poppe states that if Ethereum returns above $2,700 in the next two weeks, the altcoin may surge to around $3,200 in the next few weeks, finally breaking out of consolidation. In addition, the crypto analyst continues to reiterate his projections of Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in the coming months as the latter approaches its peak dominance level. Ethereum is expected to lead the “altcoin season” with predictions of hitting a five-digit value next few months.

Meanwhile, the altcoin reports gains of 2.09% and 6.06% in the last seven and thirty days, respectively. ETH’s daily trading volume is also up by 4.70% approaching a value of $20.85 billion.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,BNB Token Burn: $1 Billion Of Tokens Sent To ‘Black Hole’ Address — Impact On Price?,2024-11-02 10:30:42+00:00,"On Friday, November 1, the BNB Foundation announced the successful completion of the 29th quarterly burn by the BNB Chain. This latest event of the routine token burn reiterates the project’s commitment to a deflationary approach in order to ensure growth. A total of 1,772,712.363 BNB tokens (worth approximately $1.07 billion) were automatically burned in this quarter’s event. According to the foundation’s blog post, this quarter’s burning was (and subsequent token burning events will be) performed directly on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with the burn amount sent to a “black hole” address. Can The Latest Burn Event Propel BNB’s Price To $600? Token burning, a process in which tokens or coins are purposely and permanently removed from circulation, is carried out to trigger an increase in a token’s value. Similarly, the quarterly token burn can have a significant impact on BNB’s price by decreasing the total supply, thereby creating a deflationary effect. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeezes Tighter Than It Was Before 2021 Rally, What This Means Moreover, the consistency of the quarterly BNB burns shows the dedication of the foundation to the long-term growth and success of the token. This positive trend could favorably impact general market sentiment, as it strengthens investors’ trust in BNB’s potential as a stable investment. However, it is worth looking at the impact of previous quarterly burns on the BNB price to be able to gauge the potential effect of the latest event. Notably, the 28th token burn, which was completed on July 22, 2024, didn’t exactly have a bullish impact on the value of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of the BNB token sat just above $600 as of July 22. Unexpectedly, the token’s price fell more than 22% to a low of $464 about two weeks after the burn event. BNB’s value seemed to have crumbled under the bearish climate of the general market. The BNB token has mostly been in a consolidation range over the past few months, mirroring the state of Bitcoin and the general crypto market. Fortunately, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be back in the bullish zone after returning to $70,000 for the first time since June. If the strong positive correlation between BNB and Bitcoin plays out, it means that investors could see Binance’s native token resume its upward trend. Hence, BNB seems to have a positive outlook and could soon reclaim $600, especially if the flagship cryptocurrency remains bullish. BNB Price At A Glance As of this writing, the value of BNB stands around $571.8, reflecting a 0.6% price dip in the past 24 hours.

Reddit,solana,🚀 Wen Bull Run? I Built a One-Stop Dashboard for Degen Market Research,2024-11-02 11:48:26,"Hey anon degens, I got tired of jumping between 69 different sites and pages to check the market vibes, so I built a fun little site called [wenbullrun.com](https://wenbullrun.com/) as a side project – a no-bs dashboard that tells you if we're still eating ramen or if lambos are back on the menu.

Essentially, I've carefully picked some of the most reliable bull run indicators and put them all in one place. Every metric on here serves one purpose: helping you figure out if the bulls are finally back or if we're still hibernating with the bears.

What you get:

* Price action for BTC/ETH/SOL with historical comparisons (7d, 30d, 90d)
* Market dominance tracking (is BTC still king or are the alts gaining ground?)
* Quarterly Crypto VC data showing total deals and investment volume (is it crypto funding winter or summer?)
* Google Trends data (are normies searching ""bitcoin"" again?)
* Coinbase app ranking (tracking retail FOMO in real-time)
* Fear & Greed index with key values and historical averages (because emotions rule over degens)

Everything is automated except the VC investment data (which I update manually because degens need fresh hopium).

No signup required, and no ads, just charts and vibes where you can focus purely on the trend.

📈 Coming Soon:

* M2 Money Supply tracking (money printer go brrr?)
* More suggestions from you degenerates

This is just v1, and I'd love your feedback. What other features or metrics would help you ape more intelligently? What features would make this your go-to dashboard?

Build in public, learn in public. 

Let's make this thing actually useful for everyone.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Heads-up: I've noticed a few quirks, like some native Solana tokens showing up where they shouldn't and a couple of minor display issues with smart wallet counts. I’ll be cleaning up those bugs when I get the chance, but for now, this dashboard should still offer a ton of valuable info.

There is a recurring advice on finding more suitable memecoins to trade: check the team behind the meme! And see if they have had success before, or if they are serial rugpullers. I have had some success with trading lower cap memes, and now I want to slow down and trade memes that last more than a few minutes!

My question is, how to find the team behind the meme, and how to check their credentials (for the lack of a better word!)

Reddit,solana,Stacked BNSOL in Binance Earn,2024-10-31 08:09:04,"Hello,

I stacked some Solana in Binance (without using the Web3 Wallet). As I understand, the stacking rewards are induced by the increasing price of the BNSOL relative to the SOL. But automatically, my BNSOL was sent to the Earn wallet in a flexible simple earn plan with an \~10% APR.

I'm a bit confused as for me, I don't need to put the coin in an earning plan to earn stacking rewards and if the \~10% APR represents the stacking reward, the logic is contrary to what the LST technology wants to offer as it is ""locked"" in a plan (I know it's flexible but still in a plan as I cannot lend it for example).

Can someone enlight me on this topic ? TY",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

I create my meme token currently at $6K MC and ATH $8.5K MC, I know its not a lot but hey Im actually pushing every day for 22 days now. I won't give up as people have bought in and I won't let them down. 

I paid for DEX, I created TG around 150 members now, I created X going to start raiding it soon! 

I've got a plan which states what I  will do when Im on Raydium.  I have stated in the group at $50K MC I will publish those details its all to do with marketing. I have also a big give away at certain MC but I will be doing small surprise give aways, I have to look after my community.

I've primarily traded options for the past number of years, but recently have done some fun trading in the Solana ecosystem. 

While memecoins are fun and all, I'm thinking about seriously launching an on-chain decentralized options trading mechanism protocol on Solana. I've already mapped out most of the mechanisms and I've even started carving out the protocol already. 

I just wanted to see what the level of interest of such a protocol is from r/solana?

Initially, I'd probably just start off with Solana options, but eventually they could be expanded to any SPL token. Writers could stake underlying tokens and sell the exercise premium.

Reddit,solana,How to snipe your own token in the first second after it bonds on Ray from Pumpfun?,2024-10-31 00:31:53,"So here's the thing. Some devs I know tested doing a bundled launch, to get directly to Ray from pumpfun and to hold all the supply in order to avoid the dumping of the chart when jeets sell on bonding. The only problem is that a sniper got in the first second after the LP got created, he bought 9million tokens with 3.6 sol, and then fullclipped at 800k for 35sol, making a big red candle and scaring the people away :/  The token didn't die from this, but it sure didn't help...

I was thinking that one way to solve this problem would be if you could snipe your token when it hits Ray, buying in with another 50-100 sols, in order to raise the price high enough that other snipers can't buy too much supply for cheap. Could this be a good strategy? Also does anyone know some good bots that can do this? And do they require custom RPCs?

Please explain what am I missing?  I do understand that when you swap bigger amount you make a bigger price impact. but overall does it mean that less bigger transaction will impact the price of coin and Markcap less then a multitude of small transactions?

Reddit,ethereum,Market risk of a 51% attack on Polymarket,2024-11-02 22:18:06,"Over the past few days, I did a deep dive into Polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. Here’s what I’ve found:

UMA is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'Trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'Optimistic Oracle'. An 'Asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved ERC20 token) alongside the assertion. Anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'Disputer') may do so, typically by matching the Asserter's stake. If a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'Data Verification Mechanism' (DVM). When it reaches DVM, the tokenholders of UMA decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the Asserter or the Disputer receives the staked currencies). They do this with one vote per UMA token.

Polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with UMA. The API allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. The Polymarket API also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. If there is a dispute, it gets escalated to UMA's DVM system. Disputes rarely happen because the DVM works. Typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. This clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down.

However, the market cap of UMA is only about $200m as of writing this post. A 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. It is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of UMA could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on Polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the DVM for each of them, and win every bet. Doing this would destroy their $100m of UMA, but they'll potentially make more from the bets.

A quick browse of Polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). It's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on Polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. But a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""Presidential Election Winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ):

* Buy ""Yes"" on Chris Christie. $0.001. Buy 72 million shares right now for $72k.
* Buy ""No"" on Trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m
* Buy ""No"" on Kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m
* Accept the loss of $100m worth of UMA due to the price collapsing

**This would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** They could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. There's only about $670m of USDC on the Polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts.

At the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that Chris Christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on UMA.

There is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack UMA, and that would be to gain favor with Trump by using their 51% to decide Trump wins on the betting markets. It could be used to help the publicity battle that Trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election.

I would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on UMA, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). If anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. I'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%.

So, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. If UMA's market cap doesn't rise as fast as Polymarket's betting markets, Polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused.

Reddit,ethereum,I would like to make my final year university project related to Ethereum but I'm struggling to think of ideas,2024-11-02 16:58:29,"Specifically, my supervisor has instructed me that my project has to be related to the theme of cryptoeconomics and ""to analyse and extract information about the strategic behaviour of users and miners to help with the design of more efficient market-regulating mechanisms"". More specifically, it was suggested that I could do a project on PBS but this is a suggestion more than a rule.

That being said, past year's projects have related to credit ratings, fraud detection and someone else this year is doing a project on the correlation of cryptocurrency prices to traditional finance indicies (I was thinking of proposing this but it appeard too simple).

I had proposed the building of a basic MEV bot but I'm not sure if this would be too complex an undertaking over 2 semesters (6 months) and my supervisor didn't have a lot to say as this was an area that he wasn't too familiar with. Furthermore, while the project isn't prohibited and I won't lose marks or anything, there was the idea that the project would be a bit more research oriented and this is more on the developer side. One thing my supervisor mentioned is that novelty isn't a requirement and if I were to proceed with this project, I don't need a crazy original strategy.

I have a few other ideas too: Something to do with climate i.e. comparing emissions of various currencies or investigating the environmental effect of the Ethereum merge.

I hope that makes sense, I'd appreciate any feedback on the feasibility of the above ideas and if you guys had any suggestions of your own.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,ethereum,18 days activation queue on Holesky?! Something big is brewing in ETH staking 🤔,2024-11-01 13:56:14,"https://preview.redd.it/kwfa1wk1payd1.png?width=2824&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf194f89d8043bde3deb46912a04e4eb4cbbaffb

Okay, this is weird. I just tried to set up a validator on Holesky testnet and noticed I'd have to wait 18 DAYS for activation. Double-checked the queue - there are [32,033 validators ](https://holesky.beaconcha.in)waiting. On a testnet! Something's definitely cooking...

What's even more interesting is that this massive queue started forming right after EIP-7002 (the beacon state root in the EVM proposal) hit the testnet. For those not familiar, this proposal essentially enables smart contracts to verify beacon chain state, which is crucial for many staking innovations.

Looking through some GitHub discussions and Discord channels, I've noticed a lot of activity around:

* DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) implementations
* Restaking protocols
* Liquid staking solutions
* New staking pool mechanisms

I'm particularly intrigued by the DVT testing activities because of the recent Lido simpleDVT and CSM discussions about implementing validator splitting into DVT solutions. Seeing projects like SSV and others actively testing on Holesky makes me wonder if we're closer to seeing production-ready DVT implementations than we think.

Anyone else noticed this unusual testnet activity? What do you think is being tested at such scale?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,2024-10-31 14:25:40,"# Here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. 

**First a bit of context:**

I guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like MetaMask). So you don’t use crypto the way you’d use Cash App or Revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day.

But the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling YouTube, Instagram, or WhatsApp. So, if we want Ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. Plus most people in Asia and Africa are mobile-first. 

**Why do I even talk about it?**

So we've been building Kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. Our idea has been to stay open and Ethereum-aligned. This means that we haven’t set up “Sign in with Google” or embedded wallets powered by Privy, Capsule, and others. We haven’t even built an Android or Apple app - we have a PWA app so that everyone can use it.

Since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing Ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. But unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work.

I've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from Istanbul to LA and saw people getting onboarded to our app. They used Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask and many other wallets. 

Metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. Rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. Coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing.

And it’s not only Kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like Zora. Some just say: “Ah yeah, it’s normal. I will figure it out once I get in front of my laptop”. Can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances?

Last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753)

And it’s not that the Ethereum community doesn’t care about the UX. Vitalik even said at one of his talks: “We should be as decentralized and open as Linux and Android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as Apple.”

But if Steve Jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from AppStore forever.

Wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. You can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. But this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder.

And the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. But it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. And the whole idea is to have your ENS and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. 

The question is, why does it keep happening? Maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from Firefox, through Chrome up to Opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. But then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time?

If we had solved the Merge, I imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. But it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,ethereum,Best practices for Anonymous Crypto Payment System With User Tracking and Minimal Gas Fee,2024-10-31 08:42:02,"Hello! I'm looking to implement a crypto payment system where users can deposit funds without logging in—ideally through a simple QR code scan or by pasting a wallet address. However, I still need a way to track each user and monitor their total deposits. 
The main requirements are: 
1. Users deposit anonymously without requiring login. 
2. The system needs to associate each deposit with a specific user ID for tracking purposes. 
3. I want to know how much each user has deposited over time. 
4. Ideally, I’d like to minimize gas fees and avoid dust deposits. 

Questions: 
1. Has anyone implemented a similar system or found ways to make anonymous deposits work while tracking users reliably? 
2. When scanning the QR code in MetaMask, the metadata field appears empty. Has anyone encountered this issue, and is there a workaround to pass data reliably with the QR code?
3. Would using smart contracts be feasible in this context? If so, how could I reduce gas fees and avoid creating dust amounts? 
4. Alternatively, is there a way to generate unique deposit addresses for each user and avoid dust completely?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Insanely high gas fees for a single transaction using Trust Wallet,2024-10-30 17:23:51,"Yesterday I tried to make a payment, so I bought some USDC on Ethereum network and sent it to my Trust Wallet. I moved $650$ worth of USDC and paid about $4-5 in gas fee for the transaction. No biggie.

I decided to not make the payment after all, and now I want to send back the USDC so I can sell them, but TrustWallet wants over $130 of gas fees. (UPDATE: IT'S OVER 270 NOW.)

How is this possible? Am I doing something wrong? How could the transaction cost about $4 yesterday and over $130 today? 

Btw I checked multiple times during the day and the cost was always insanely high.

I mean I understand gas fees are dependant on congestion of ETH network but $130 for a single transaction?

How can I get my money back to Revolut without losing almost $140 just for sending it back and forth? This is insanity.

On Trust Wallet there are multiple options of selling my USDC directly but I don't know if they are trustworthy(MoonPay or Ramp).

https://imgur.com/a/ffBjxVK


EDIT:
The fee is about $270 now. 😂😂 
Seriously, is Trust Wallet a scam? Am I overlooking something?

Even Swapping my USDC to ETH costs about $270. How could it cost 5$ yesterday, same ETH network, and today 270?

If someone has any idea how to help me get my money back without paying these insane fees, I will send him/her like $20 or so. Thank you.

Reddit,ethereum,Zerion Wallet SWAP Redirected My Funds to an Unknown Address – Intentional Scam or Security Flaw?,2024-10-29 14:52:09,"I’m posting this because **Zerion** wallet just cost me funds in what looks like either a major UI failure or worse: an intentional setup to siphon funds. After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.
* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse.
* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,ethereum,Liberation from the taboo on price discussions,2024-10-29 06:07:30,"The Ethereum community still seems to ignore or taboo discussions on price.

Even after the transition to POS, the equation of 'price = security' has been established for Ethereum.

In the debate with Bitcoin maximalists, the Ethereum community, including Vitalik, argued that the burning mechanism is better for increasing value than the fixed issuance amount.

This is also why Justin Drake's 'Ultra Sound Money' meme was born.

I think we need to discuss more seriously how to gradually increase the price of Ethereum. This is not just about making money. The goal is to make Ethereum the network with the strongest security and censorship resistance.

What Bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity. The belief in the immutable issuance rules. In the case of Ethereum, the policy on the total issuance amount seems too vague. I think this is Ethereum's worst selling point.

I thought about several monetary policies.

1. Increase the burn fee when the target total issuance exceeds 100 million, and reduce the burn fee when it falls below, maintaining 100 million.

2. Burn all fees including MEV to create endless deflation. When the total issuance decreases to 50 million, split the coin in half. Then, the number of Ethers will be 50 million -> 100 million -> 50 million -> 100 million repeatedly. People get excited when companies like Tesla and Nvidia do Stocksplit.

3. Set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,ethereum,"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared Vision",2024-10-26 11:41:15,"I’ve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. On the surface, they may seem like separate communities—one focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology—but at their core, they’re both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society.

Both UBI and Ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. They’re about creating a world where we don’t have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we’re looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. It’s about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society.

Money, when you think about it, is political. Every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. In a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper—into the structures that uphold our shared reality.

For those interested in diving further into this vision, here’s a bit of inspiration from popular culture:

- **Arrival** – A film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens.
- **Outlander** – A story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today.
- **Mad Men** – A look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception.
- **Devs** – A glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself.

These themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. Basic Income and Ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future.

Reddit,ethereum,I can't understand L2 networks no matter what,2024-10-21 12:27:28,"So my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular L2 right and if I make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? 


If say bob sends 1 eth to Alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? 


And how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn?


please help, I can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are L2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues.



---




Edit: It finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/DepartedQuantity for helping me out.


So here's my understanding:

Till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the L1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the L1 as a single transaction with some proofs. And some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. 


But the thing is that the L2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. Connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. And all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network    are transactions details(or whatever) in L2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered.


And not L1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,ethereum, Ethereum builder centralization and your contribution,2024-10-18 22:13:25,"In recent weeks, more than 90% of Ethereum blocks have been built by just two block builders: beaverbuild.org and titanbuilder.xyz. This trend is growing, and it’s likely these two will dominate nearly all block production soon, profiting massively from users transactions MEV. [https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d](https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d)

The driving force behind this centralization is XOF (private orderflow), as explained by Toni Wahrstätter on X: [https://x.com/nero\_eth/status/1846786871998759141](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1846786871998759141)

So, where does this private orderflow originate?

For [titanbuilder.xyz](http://titanbuilder.xyz), it partly comes from BananaGunBot (https://x.com/BananaGunBot), as seen in blocks like this one: [https://etherscan.io/block/20959121](https://etherscan.io/block/20959121)

For [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org), it comes from platforms like [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (https://cow.fi/mev-blocker). Their FAQ states they submit to all major builders:

>MEV Blocker submits to all major block builders, including Builder0x69, f1b, Flashbots, rsync builder, Titan Builder, Gambit Labs, and Beaver Build.

But there is a catch: who created MEV Blocker? according to their FAQ:

>MEV Blocker is jointly formulated and maintained by CoW Protocol, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is open to all searchers and block builders.

The last part seems questionable. With control over the order flow, who would rationally share most profitable or important transactions with competitors?

It gets worse: a bot operated by beaverbuild uses the same calldata as the notorious jaredfromsubway MEV bot (https://x.com/MevRefund/status/1835666845547815067), suggesting beaverbuild likely operates the jared bot. jaredfromsubway is known for sandwiching pretty much everything and everyone (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f2f10d1c40777ae1da742455c65828ff36df387).

So, what’s my point? Avoid trading shitcoins, especially with BananaGun. And don’t use [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (rather make sure you have set your slippage tolerance correctly), which appears to be little more than a hypocritical frontend for beaverbuild.

Reddit,ethereum,Lido's Simple DVT Module Surpasses Expectations—A Deeper Look at Distributed Validator Technology's Future in Ethereum Staking,2024-10-18 11:50:36,"I’ve been keeping an eye on the recent developments with Lido’s Simple DVT module, and the numbers are impressive. Just recently, the module hit 2,250 validators and over 72,000 ETH staked, surpassing its initial 0.5% share limit, as noted by u/LidoFinance. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) now powers around 0.75% of the entire Lido protocol. What’s even more interesting is how these DVT clusters are outperforming 8 out of the top 10 staking entities, according to u/ratedw3b.

This got me thinking: What does this mean for the future of Ethereum staking? 🤔

For one, the decentralization of staking is clearly on the rise. DVT allows for a more robust and fault-tolerant staking infrastructure, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure. Projects like SSV Network and Obol Collective are really pushing the envelope here, making Ethereum staking more accessible and secure for both solo and community stakers. It’s awesome to see over 140 new solo and community stakers becoming node operators via DVT—this is a huge step toward decentralization.

But it also raises a bigger question: Could DVT be the key to breaking the dominance of large staking pools and making Ethereum more decentralized at the protocol level? 🤔

SSV Network, in particular, has been at the forefront of this movement. By enabling secure and distributed validator setups, they are changing the game for both small-scale stakers and large operators. I can’t help but wonder how this will impact the wider Ethereum ecosystem, especially as staking becomes more fragmented and democratized.

Would love to hear what you all think—are we on the verge of a decentralization revolution in Ethereum staking, or is it too early to tell? ",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

TLDR in the title. The idea of tracking Coinbase's rank on the App Store as market sentiment isn't new, I read about this here on Reddit and other places.

I got inspired by this and made a page to monitor Coinbase and other popular apps (see image below) in one place + I'm transforming all ranks to a simple composite index. Later, we'll be able to compare it with the BTC, ETH price correlation.

Reddit,ethereum,Domain Registrar Based on Smart Contracts,2024-10-17 17:05:22,"# Project Concept

We propose creating a new type of domain registrar that uses smart contracts instead of traditional accounts to determine domain management rights.

# How It Works

1. When transferring a domain to this registrar, functions in the smart contract are called to add the new domain.
2. The address of the smart contract that has the rights to sign changes related to this domain is specified.

# Advantages

1. **Decentralized Management:** Domains do not depend on an individual's email.
2. **Flexible Management:** Ability to use multi-signature or DAO voting for decisions on DNS record changes.
3. **Security:** Use of cryptographic protection methods instead of passwords.
4. **Transparency:** All changes are recorded on the blockchain.

# Technical Implementation

1. **Integration with Existing DNS:** The service functions as a regular centralized registrar, fully compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure.
2. **Support for Popular Domains:** Ability to transfer and manage top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.).
3. **Auto-Renewal:** The system automatically renews domain registration by deducting funds from the smart contract.
4. **Open Balance Top-Up:** Any user can top up the contract balance for a specific domain without the need for authorization.

# Potential Applications

* For DAO projects
* For collaborative business projects
* For personal use (using a wallet instead of email for ownership confirmation)

# Questions for the Community

1. If such a project were implemented and announced by one of the top 10 existing domain registrars, would you use it for your new project?
2. Would you consider using this service for your personal domains?
3. What additional features would you like to see in such a service?
4. How do you assess the potential of this technology for managing digital assets in the future?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Been following it since.

Really threw myself down the rabbit hole, enough to debunk critiques or outright incorrect statements.

All through 2022 and 2023 mainstream media was dancing on bitcoin's ""grave""

Making ridiculous statements

""Bitcoiners are psychopaths""

""Bitcoin is only used for criminal activity""

""Bitcoin is harmful to the environment and a drain on our power infrastructure""

If I had not done my own research, I would have probably just accepted what the talking heads on TV say.

I wholeheartedly believe the media intentionally lied about bitcoin.

Maybe so Blackrock could scoop it up in their ETF.

Where's the skeptics now? Where's the experts scolding bitcoiners? Where's the man in the expensive suit telling me I'm wrong and stupid?

I have absolutely ZERO trust in the media.

Fuck these people.

They knowingly lied to your face about inflation.

What else do they lie about?

What else do they exaggerate or gaslight to the public.

American citizens lost 25% of their purchasing power over these four years.

""Teehee oh I guess since Larry Fink endorses it now you dumbasses can have our seal of approval""

If people understood what the media did, we would have guillotines outside CNN, CBS, MSNBC.

25% gone.

The previous epoch’s block reward was 6.25 BTC. So, how would that look drawing a modest $60K per year for a single individual? (just for funzzies).

Well, using [](https://twitter.com/bitcoinhornet) ‘s BTC FIRE calculator the worst case scenario (Photo 1) you‘d eventually end up with a perpetual 1.5 BTC / $5M total capital minimum never really running below that level for life and at the recommend neutral power-law band scenario (Photo 2) you’d eventually end up with minimum 3.7 BTC / $18M total capital which, of course continues to increase in value.

6.25 BTC costs about the same as the average American home sale price right now.

Also for reference, MicroStrategy’s bear case for 2045 is $3M, base case $13M, and bull case is $45M. Photo 1 says $4M and Photo 2 says $10M. So i’d say both of these hypothetical scenarios run between MicroStrategy’s bear and base case e.g. conservative. ",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,bitcoin,Two Common Barriers to Understanding Bitcoin,2024-11-02 18:31:48,"Are you hesitant about Bitcoin? There are likely two reasons:

*Reason 1: Past Experience*

1. You previously invested in Bitcoin, sold too early, or tried leverage trading and lost money. Your feelings are hurt, making you want Bitcoin to fail because you missed the boat. Your ego is holding you back. Consider a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

*Reason 2: Lack of Understanding*

1. You're unfamiliar with Bitcoin or haven't done sufficient research. Watching YouTube videos is a good starting point, but explore educational books and articles too. Bitcoin is complex; studying it takes time.

*A Lifelong Learning Journey*

Bitcoin is a rabbit hole. Despite years of study, I'm still learning. This technology is relatively new and challenging to grasp. Your first Bitcoin investment should be education.

Remember, losing money is an opportunity to learn, a ""cost of tuition"" in understanding the space. ",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930
Reddit,bitcoin,PSA Your Old Blockchain.info wallets ARE recoverable,2024-11-01 20:45:59,"A while ago I searched in my email and realized I had a email from Blockchain.info circa 2014. I ended up contacting Blockchain.info as the only info it had was a login link that no longer works. Blockchain info told me there is no way to recover it without my recovery seed. 

I forgot about it and a while ago Gmail sent me a notification that an email was going to be closed because I hadn’t logged into it for a few years. Turns out I had use that email in 2014 to set up a Blockchain.info wallet and nothing else. 

I again reached out to blockchain to make sure there was no way to recover it and again was told without my recovery seed there was nothing to be done. 

I didn’t give up this time and found a Reddit thread from a few years ago that had the info I needed. 

The email will have a URL similair to below 

https://blockchain.info/wallet/1b729495-43e2-41c8-9cdc-00000000f

Everything after wallet/ is your username. You just need to guess/remember the password and login here

https://login.blockchain.com/beta/auth/login?product=wallet

But it gets worse!

That link above will save you a lot of time because on the main login page If you guess the wrong password it just says invalid login. However when you get the right password it will tell you to it’s invalid but “you should try our legacy site here”

Finally logging in on the legacy site(which I linked above) will work

Fuck you blockchain.info for not just having bad customer service but customer service so bad it will literally cost people money. 

My 0.01 Bitcoin is safely back in a utxo I control the key to. 

EDIT: After looking into it further, there no longer appears to be a legacy site and login on the main wallet page works as expected. Support will still tell you “ it is not possible to login with your recovery seed” which is false. You can login to any wallet ever created with blockchain.info, their support is just doesn’t know how to do their job which is a reflection on management. ",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,bitcoin,"Don’t make my mistake, just hold for the long term",2024-11-01 06:01:55,"I have been an investor for around 11 years and I have never had an issue holding companies for many years because I can follow their progress and see them get stronger and increase earnings. Also a lot of the companies I own pay dividends which is nice and comforting. 

With Bitcoin I don’t get any of that and therefore it makes it very hard for me to hold on to. Even though I feel like I ‘understand it’ and can see its value it’s hard for me to get a true conviction.

This has led me to become a terrible market timer instead of a long term holder.

I bought Bitcoin for the first time in 2017 when it was around $4500 and later selling at $12.000. Bought in again at $18.000 in 2020/21 and sold after the crash at $40.000. And last time I bought in again at the beginning of 2024 around $35.000.

This might not look too bad but the problem is that I did not increase the invested amount a whole lot with each new purchase. So in 2017 I had a whole coin but right now it’s only a fraction of that. 

Anyway that’s enough rambling. I hope this post can be a turning point for me and I will do my best to just hold on from here on :)

Cheers and happy hodling.

Reddit,bitcoin,What would your ideal Blockchain look like to replace Web 2.0 ?,2024-11-02 19:31:07,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been diving deep into blockchain technology and thinking about what an ideal blockchain would look like if it were to truly replace Web 2.0 and even the traditional monetary system. It’s such an exciting and complex concept, and I'd love to hear what others think.

Here's how I envision it:

**1. Scalable and Interoperable Infrastructure**

**2. Decentralization with Flexible Governance**

**3. Privacy and Data Protection**

**4. High Performance and User-Friendly Experience**

**5. Global and Stable Digital Currency**

**6. Responsible and Sustainable Data Use**

A robust DApp marketplace would offer everything from social media and messaging to e-commerce and content management, all on a decentralized foundation. With ethical AI and analytics, data privacy would be a priority, respecting user rights and making sure people control their own data.

This is just one vision of a ""dream blockchain"" that could transform Web 2.0 and traditional finance. But I'm curious—if you could design the ultimate blockchain, what features or innovations would you prioritize? How would you approach the challenges of scalability, sustainability, and mass usability for billions worldwide?

I’d love to hear your ideas and see how they compare. Looking forward to a great discussion!",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,bitcoin,"10,000 Plebs Can Change The World",2024-11-02 01:23:05,"With institutions and nation-states getting involved in Bitcoin, it can feel like the humble pleb is no longer relevant. But I'm here to tell you that **dedicated plebs can change the world**. Let's imagine a ""doomsday"" scenario: every single current holder begins to sell bitcoin in order to suppress the price, while a rag-tag group of 10,000 plebs each buys 10 USD of BTC per day. If we run this through a simulation, we get the chart below. The orange line is the amount of BTC held by sellers, and the black line is the theoretical price of bitcoin at which the plebs' buy pressure would match the sell pressure from sellers and the block subsidy. As we can see, the sellers can keep a lid on the clearing price by continuously selling (note: each large jump upwards coincides with a halving, since the sell pressure from the block subsidy gets cut in half):

And it's possible that the sellers can keep this up for a long time! Below is the same simulation extended until just before the sellers run out of BTC. As we can see, the sellers successfully keep a lid on prices the whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/obboa4m02eyd1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=b477257a53a7ae820f587df762d41ea3fac34766



But once those sellers run out of BTC, then the plebs are buying straight from the tiny amount of BTC available for sale from the block subsidy, and the theoretical clearing price soars instantaneously:

Obviously, this is not financial advice, and this simulation is for a completely unrealistic situation. But the point is: **even with all the new entrants in the space, the humble pleb still matters.**",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

So I have planned something different and I am here for a double-check to ensure it will work:

- Generate a private-public key pair offline using Electrum on a USB Live OS.

- Use a steel device to store the private key (you can easily find these online).

- Copy the public key and use it to receive transactions.

- When I want to move the funds back to my exchange, I can create and sign the transaction offline, then go online only to broadcast it.

The reason btc is going to eventually go away is because it is relatively obsolete. There are better ""coins"" that transacate faster, more efficiently (aka less fees when transacting/trading with it). Idk what coin that will be but I know there are much better. I think eventually when that coin comes out BTC will likely lose a lot of its value as users unload their product to trade for that newer innovative better product and when that happens a lot more users will panick dump to avoid losing equity. 

But also the issue is that large portions of BTC value are already stored by governments. And when I say large (I'm too lazy to look up the numbers, but I wouldn't be surprised if govts could short if they wanted to) they can likely manipulate the price of btc with what they are able to sell?(Afterall the BTC was purchased with the dollar, they can print more and buy again, maybe some laundering scheme). 

And I imagine more and more innovation happens and eventually people will trade away their BTC, and the die hard will hold their coins and maybe make a few shekels but eventually BTC will fade into obscurity. Who knows when But the shift could  start as abruptly as tomorrow or whenever that ultimate innovation becomes known and trusted by the public.

First and foremost, halving events reduce the block reward for miners, cutting the new supply of Bitcoin generated. This decrease in supply, while demand remains stable or increases, typically leads to upward price pressure.

Historically, previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 were followed by significant price increases. Market participants often anticipate similar patterns, creating positive sentiment that can drive demand. Additionally, as Bitcoin matures, each halving garners more media attention and interest from both retail and institutional investors, which can further increase participation in the market.

Furthermore, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. The halving event emphasizes its scarcity, attracting more investors looking for alternative assets. Finally, traders and investors often speculate around halving events, leading to increased buying activity that can drive prices higher both leading up to and following the event.

Overall, the 2028 halving is anticipated to reinforce Bitcoin's scarcity narrative and boost investor confidence, contributing to potential price appreciation.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,bitcoin,Recovering a 2013 blockchain.info aes encrypted wallet,2024-11-01 13:21:29,"Hello,

  
I have a wallet.aes.json that was created on March 2013 by [blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info) as a backup emailed to me. I had at the time toyed with bitcoin mining for 2 months but didn't preserve anything from that time other than the email backup and transaction records that all came via email. 

I do not have the recovery mnemonic, and I've tried all my passwords including using btcrecover to try all possible combinations and typos to no avail. I can use my wallet identifier and start to login into [blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info) where it will ask for a password and at that point everything i try fails.

I'm wondering if based on the age of the wallet a few things:

1. Was password creation on [blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info) at that time stringent about certain characters, or length of password that may help me steer my memory as to why all my normal passwords fail?

2. Is something about the aes encryption not standard or broken about the wallet that will require a different routine to decrypt it? I saw on a btcrecover youtube that some wallets this age may be missing leading zeros which I thought the python tool took into account. For reference the encrypted wallet contains a 512 character string that includes symbols like / and + in addition to numbers and letters.

  
Any help would be appreciated. ",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Monthly Optimists Discussion - November 2024,2024-11-01 09:04:07,"Welcome to the Monthly Optimists Discussion thread. As the title implies, the purpose of this thread is to promote discussion which is guardedly optimistic about cryptocurrency topics. This thread is intended to be a counterweight to the Skeptics Discussion thread and will be pinned when the markets are bearish.

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence. For example, announcing an obscure online store is adopting coin X for payments and then speculate Amazon will adopt it next without evidence. Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator. Please report shilling or any comments which violate the rules.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What is required for crypto to be the future?,2024-11-02 01:11:58,"This is a rant!

I've recently discovered crypto in a more deep sense. I absolutely love the idea of decentralized finances and trustless systems. The technology of block-chains is fascinating. However I have one issue, if we want to use crypto like we do cash, (buy coffee, a house, new shoes, etc.) what is needed to make that happen?

Crypto is extremely volatile right now. So it doesn't make sense to me to pay for things with (lets say Litecoin) when the Litecoin could be worth 70 USD one day and 35 next month. (I understand that the perfect scenario is everyone uses crypto derived from limited supply currencies like bitcoin, and thus we have a decentralized, low fee, hard money system.) But let's be realistic, crypto will not replace fiat money in our lifetimes. So if the (ex. US) is still based on the USD, and inflation continues to occur, how does crypto help us fight that? You would essentially need your L1 currency of limited supply to increase in price equal to that of inflation, otherwise your currency has just succumb to inflation. So how do we deal with this?

Ideally, in a world of fiat and crypto, I should be able to hold an appreciating base currency that grows equal to or greater than inflation of fiat money, and then swap some of the base to a stable coin whenever I need to make a purchase or just convert it to fiat money.

So how do we get to a point where the L1 currencies are appreciating at a rate greater than or equal to inflation in an given moment. If I buy into bitcoin and convert 70k USD to 1 BTC, and I want to buy something that costs 70k USD (1 BTC), but then BTC is worth 65K the next week, I can no longer buy that 70k USD item. If I were to put 70k USD into a stable coin worth at 1:1, I would succumb to inflation as I directly need as many stable coins as dollars. But if I use a coin that is some set ratio of an L1 coin then we have a hard money system. But that hard money system is still attached to fiat inflation and other movements.

So how do we preserve value in crypto while connecting fiat movements while preserving peoples purchasing power.

I don't know I feel like I've been thinking in loops. I think I understand crypto and I do understand the US federal reserve and the gold standard, I'm just having a lot of difficulty connecting the two and making it make sense. I'm liking missing something.

Like if I buy into bitcoin at 70k and wanna buy a house for 700k or 10 BTC but then BTC went down, well fuck I guess I just lost my purchasing power. But then oh wait I can now afford a 1.7 million dollar house with my 10 BTC? How is that a good store of value?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

I'm looking to incorporate Tether (USDT) into my portfolio as a way to manage liquidity. I already invest in other assets, and I self-custody my Bitcoin, but Tether is new to me. I’m hoping some of you can offer guidance on the basics here.

1. Where to buy Tether – I know it's widely available on many exchanges, but I'm looking for recommendations on secure platforms, especially those that make it straightforward to transfer USDT to a personal wallet.


2. Best wallet options for USDT – For Bitcoin, I use a hardware wallet, but I'm unsure which wallets are reliable and offer good support specifically for Tether.


3. Choosing the blockchain for USDT – With Tether available on multiple blockchains (Ethereum, TRON, etc.), I’m not sure which one would be best for long-term storage. Are there trade-offs between security, fees, and convenience?


I'm looking to manage this safely with a long-term view, so any advice on these points or other Tether-related insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Form 1099-DA Explained: How New Reporting Requirements Will Impact Crypto Investors (USA),2024-11-01 15:13:53,"*The IRS Form 1099-DA is planned to take effect January 1, 2025 and will be required for all digital asset brokers.*

# Introduction

The IRS has drafted the first ever tax form specific to crypto and digital assets. This form, Form 1099-DA, will fundamentally change how cryptos are reported to the IRS and individuals, shifting much of the reporting responsibility off of the taxpayer and onto ""brokers"". More on that later.

# Background

In April 2024, the IRS released the first draft of Form 1099-DA with requirements for custodial brokers being released in July 2024 and a revised draft of Form 1099-DA in August 2024. This form and associated reporting requirements will bring more transparency and reporting to the crypto space than ever before. For the first time, crypto transactions will more or less be treated similar to traditional assets like stock and securities when it comes to brokers being required to report transaction activity to both the taxpayer as well as the IRS. Effective for the 2025 tax year, the IRS will be receiving an immense amount of data regarding taxpayer's crypto activity.

# Key Points

1. **This form aims to standardize reporting requirements over digital assets, requiring all ""brokers"" to submit a 1099-DA to the IRS and taxpayer**. The IRS defines a broker as an entity that “regularly provides services effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person”. This includes exchanges, digital asset wallet providers that facilitate trades/transfers, and can even potentially include crypto ATMs. This, of course, raises a lot of questions for wallet providers and crypto ATMs that are not KYC. It is very possible that those brokers who do not collect the adequate information from the taxpayer to complete the 1099-DA will be out of compliance and could face legal action if they continue to serve US taxpayers.
   1. There has been some confusion around whether or not noncustodial wallets will be classified as brokers for purposes of these reporting requirements. [In the final requirements Rule published by the IRS in July 2024](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/09/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for#:~:text=Proposed%20§%E2%80%891.6045%2D1(a)), the IRS specifies that a facilitative service includes any service that ""directly or indirectly effectuates a sale of digital assets, such as providing a party in the sale with access to an automatically executing contract or protocol, providing access to digital asset trading platforms, providing an automated market maker system, providing order matching services, providing market making functions, providing services to discover the most competitive buy and sell prices, or providing escrow or escrow-like services to ensure both parties to an exchange act in accordance with their obligations"". While this language suggests it is very likely certain unhosted wallets *could* be subject to the 1099-DA reporting requirements, it is also important to note that ""unhosted wallet providers"" has removed from the explicit definition of ""broker"". This continues to be a grey area and we are eagerly awaiting more clarity from the IRS.
2. **The 1099-DA will provide proceeds, cost basis, and gain/loss details for each transaction** facilitated on the platform, as well as additional details. More on cost basis later.
3. **There is a new section for ""wash sales""**. The instructions read: ""Shows the amount of nondeductible loss in a wash sale transaction involving digital assets *that are also stock or securities for tax purposes*."" This is particularly confusing as we know [the IRS currently defines crypto as property](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets#:~:text=For%20U.S.%20tax%20purposes%2C%20digital,%2C%20owned%2C%20transferred%20or%20traded). This likely means that, as expected, new guidance and regulation will be coming out explicitly disallowing wash sales for crypto. As mentioned in a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ge6i3r/what_to_know_about_the_wash_sale_loophole_tax/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), the wash sale loophole is still currently open for crypto in 2024, but is expected to be closed as early as 2025. This wording in the 1099-DA further solidifies these expectations. 
4. **""Noncovered Assets"" will be specifically identified and documented.** Noncovered assets are assets that the broker did not provide custodial services for or assets that were transferred into the platform and/or were acquired prior to 2026. If the box is checked indicating it's a non covered asset, certain fields in the form may be blank INCLUDING THE COST BASIS FIELD. This is extremely important to understand as the proceeds may appear as 100% capital gains unless you provide the accurate cost basis on the asset. This will result in taxpayers paying substantially more tax than they might actually owe. Taxpayers should not rely on 1099-DAs with missing cost basis data for tax owed.
5. **Brokers must attest to relying on customer-provided data.** There is a section where the broker will indicate if they have relied on customer provided data, such as cost basis. The ability to submit data such as cost basis will vary on a broker by broker basis. For example, Coinbase may create a feature to input your own cost basis on assets transferred into the exchange which will then be included on the 1099-DA. If that is the case, this box will be checked.
6. **Both stablecoins** **and NFT transactions are allowed to be aggregated (separately)**, as long as total proceeds is less than $10,000 annually. All other digital asset transactions will have to be reported separately.

# Implications For Taxpayers

Taxpayers can expect to receive 1099-DAs from various different exchanges and wallet providers. The forms received will also be reported directly to the IRS. However, for assets purchased prior to 2025 as well as all assets transferred into a qualifying exchange/wallet provider, cost basis data will not be accurate and will be left blank on the form. As a result, it is imperative that taxpayers maintain accurate cost basis records on their own and continue to report their transaction using Form 8949 (these 1099-DA forms do not replace the requirement to report using Form 8949 and Schedule D). 

# Comments

While the 1099-DA is going to help streamline data requirements, there are still many issues this will not solve. For one, there are various cost basis accounting methods available to taxpayers. The 1099-DA will default to First-In-First-Out (FIFO). However, a taxpayer may elect to utilize Specific Identification (assuming they meet the data requirements), allowing them to elect more favorable methods such as Highest-In-First-Out (HIFO), which may result in differences in what is being reported on the Form 1099-DA vs what the taxpayer is reporting on their 8949. While the 1099-DA will help bring a lot more transparency to crypto trading, it will not necessarily result in fully accurate tax reporting for taxpayers. 

Additionally, it is very important that taxpayers do not solely rely on the 1099-DAs, especially if transferring assets between wallets and exchanges. As mentioned, if an exchange receives an asset from an outside source, it will assign a blank/$0 cost basis to the asset on the 1099-DA. If this was provided to a traditional CPA or filed into turbotax, this would wrongfully result in 100% capital gain. Instead, the taxpayer should identify the cost basis on the assets transferred in and ensure they are correctly reporting it on their 8949. By maintaining accurate records for all crypto activity, taxpayers can ensure they have the proper paper trail to back up their numbers as well as ensure they are optimizing and minimizing tax due while remaining compliant. 

# TLDR

Starting January 1, 2025, brokers dealing with digital assets, including exchanges and certain wallet providers, must collect and report taxpayer transaction data to the IRS via Form 1099-DA. This form will detail proceeds, cost basis, and gain/loss, though gaps in cost basis (for non-covered assets) can impact tax liability. Taxpayers should keep independent records, especially for assets transferred between wallets,  to ensure accurate tax reporting.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Jesse Eckles, Lady Crypto, etc. Most do not say specifically why but infer they will have made their money and are ready for the next challenge. What is the communities opinion on this? 

Is Crypto evolving into something else and would require different skills or knowledge and smart people recognize this and choose the smart thing to do is leave? Is the next bull run going to lead to even more successes than Crypto has generated?  Or has the days of 1000X gone and the adrenaline rush will follow and Crypto shall evolve into just another market (if is not already)?

I personally am leaning towards the latter and analyzing historical stock market lessons that may inform my Cryptp speculation.  What say you?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

###Guidelines: 

 * Share any uncertainties, shortcomings, concerns, etc you have about crypto related projects.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"MicroStrategy's $9.91 billion investment is now worth $18,330,383,597, by only holding and not giving into FUD",2024-10-30 21:36:55,"MicroStrategy currently holds approximately  252,000 Bitcoin.


Their average purchase price being $39,200, their investment of $9.91 billion is currently worth $18,330,383,597, as of October 31 2024, Bitcoin being worth $73,000.


We've seen people say it was a bad investment, that MicroStrategy was going to fail, and million other things, while they never cared and kept buying. They've doubled their money into $18 billion by purely DCAing and holding.


And we have no idea how high Bitcoin will keep going, as it's just getting started, and their profits might become even more.


Both MicroStrategy and El Salvador have made crazy amount of gains while both were criticised for their decision initially.


And the first few days of October had everyone thinking we won't get anywhere near the ATH, but it seems the market doesn't really care about TAs and what we think.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, *maybe, eventually,* someone will need to *start thinking about* migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack.

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations?

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems.

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,crypto,Falcon vs. Dilithium vs. SPHINCS+,2024-08-30 17:39:49,"What do you believe is the best choice.

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

This is more of a Falcon vs. Dilithium post as they seem to be the more commonly used.

Why should I prefer Dilithium over Falcon? Any opinions?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930
Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-11-03 00:56:06.460930

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times
