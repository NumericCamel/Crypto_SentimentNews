SUI’s fundamentals also paint a bullish picture for the crypto and indicate that it could be one of the best performers in this market cycle. Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? SUI Eyes Breakout With Traders Going Long SUI could be on the verge of a breakout, with traders betting that the crypto will rise higher. Coinglass data shows that the long/short ratio is currently at 1.3, with 56.65% of traders opening long positions on SUI compared to 43.35% of traders with short positions. Trading volume for SUI’s derivatives has surged by over 33%, indicating that these traders are very confident about the crypto rising higher.  Meanwhile, open interest is also up by over 14%, further confirming the massive attention that SUI is currently gaining. These long traders already look to have the upper hand, seeing how the short terms have witnessed more liquidations. Further data from Coinglass shows that $5.14 million in short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours compared to $1.58 million in long positions.  This is bullish for the SUI price as the breakout could easily be achieved as more short traders get shaken out of their positions. Moreover, the coin has been rallying for a while, and its fundamentals and technical analysis suggest that this upward trend could continue. SUI has already rallied over 100% in the last month, breaking into the top 20 crypto ranking in the process. Fundamentals that support a further price rally for the coin include the surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the Sui network. DeFiLlama data shows that decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on the network has shot up over 50% this last week. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is also rising, as it recently crossed the $1 billion mark.  A Price Breakout To $2.50 Crypto expert Michael Van De Poppe predicted that the SUI price could rise to as high as $2.50 soon enough. He noted that the coin achieved a strong bounce at the $1.79 price level. In line with this, he expects the price to continue towards new highs, potentially reaching between $2.20 and $2.50.  A rally to this price range is significant as it will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the SUI price, whose current ATH is $2.18. Meanwhile, crypto analyst The Cryptomist indicated that the coin’s weekly close is likely to determine its next move. She claimed a break above $1.91 would lead to price discovery.  Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Falters 15% As Crypto Market Tries To Bounce Back At the time of writing, SUI is trading at around $2, up over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.   Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Expert Dissects $60 Forecast For XRP Price, Institutional Investors Are The Key",2024-10-12 22:00:45+00:00,"A particular crypto analyst has boldly predicted that XRP price could rise to $60, driven by the influx of demand and capital from institutional investors as it taps into the market share or daily volume of the SWIFT, a global messaging solution for banking and payment.  Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Falters 15% As Crypto Market Tries To Bounce Back XRP Eyes $60 With SWIFT’s Volume Boost In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Levi Rietveld proposed a unique scenario where XRP’s price could potentially surge to $60, marking a staggering increase of approximately 11,220% from its current value of $0.53. Firstly, Rietveld referred to a 2017 paper indicating SWIFT’s daily payment processes.  According to the paper, SWIFT typically manages about $5 trillion in daily transactions, accumulating to $1.25 quadrillion every year. Based on current market changes and more adoption of the network, the analyst suggested that the figure will likely rise in 2024. He disclosed that SWIFT’s daily transactions have possibly increased to $7 trillion, equating to $1.8 quadrillion annually.  The analyst also noted that SWIFT’s payment message volumes are usually about 11.5 million daily, with an average payment size of around $45,000. Moreover, he reveals that the current average payment size has increased to $60,000 per transaction, highlighting the staggering amount of fees it takes to execute just one transaction.   Taking these figures into consideration, Rietveld has hypothesized that if XRP can acquire just 10% of SWIFT’s overall market share, the cryptocurrency could see an “astronomical” increase in its price. Starting on a more conservative estimate, the analyst revealed that with a 5% market share which is about $239.4 billion in daily volume, XRP could see a 1,252.5X increase. This is equivalent to a 9,080.6% surge in XRP, pushing its value to new all time highs at $26.62.  Rietveld further estimated that with a 10% market share, XRP’s price could rise to $52, and even surpass $200 with 20% of SWIFT’s volume. The analyst has called on crypto investors to begin accumulating XRP, stressing that his ambitious projections for the cryptocurrency are not far-fetched, given its advantages over SWIFT in terms of cost, speed, and reliability.  Institutional Adoption To Drive XRP Price Even Higher While hypothesizing the extent of XRP’s price surge with a small percentage of SWIFT’s volume, Rietveld also disclosed that the cryptocurrency could see a massive price increase as adoption from institutional investors skyrockets. The analyst disclosed that the XRP market may undergo a significant supply shock when institutional investors begin accumulating the cryptocurrency.  Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? He revealed that over time, institutional investors will eventually need to buy XRP from the public supply, as the tokens locked in escrow would not be sufficient to meet demand. Considering XRP’s already limited supply, Rietveld has projected that the potential supply shock would trigger a massive price rally to about $200 in the next 10 years.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

The price of ADA started the week on a bearish note and spent the majority of the week trending downwards. Particularly, the ADA price fell by about 9.5% to bottom out at $0.33260. However, the crypto has rebounded and has increased by about 6% from this low.  This price rebound was accompanied by a large transaction volume, especially from large holders, also known as whales. According to data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), this transaction volume amounted to 17.33 billion ADA, worth about $6 billion. Major Uptick In Cardano Whale Activity The Large Transaction Volume metric from IntoTheBlock tracks details on transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, this metric puts the worth of whale transactions at $24.18 billion in the past seven days, a notable increase from last week’s readings. A huge part of these transactions were recorded in the past three days, with $6 billion movements coming on October 11 and $5.8 billion on October 10.  Related Reading: Ethereum TD Setup: Why The ETH Price Must Hold $2,250 The uptick in whale activity appears to be closely linked to ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. According to a recent report from InputOutput, Cardano has remained a major hub for blockchain developers, especially following the recent node upgrades to v.9.2.0 and the subsequent v.9.2.1. InputOutput’s data reveals that by the end of September, there were 1,376 active projects being built on Cardano, underscoring its popularity among blockchain innovators. Additionally, during September, the number of minted native tokens grew by 80,000, while the total number of transactions on the network surged by 1.34 million. ADA Price To Reach $0.5 Or Drop Again? ADA’s price action has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, and sentiment among investors has been more negative than usual, especially on social media. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed this sentiment on social media platform X. Hoskinson clarified that the negative outlook doesn’t reflect any failure on Cardano’s part, emphasizing that the project continues to grow. He also took the opportunity to criticize other crypto ecosystems, remarking that Cardano remains one of the few cryptocurrencies still committed to being a true decentralized currency, unlike those aligning with corporate giants like BlackRock and Wall Street. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Despite the pessimism, the ADA price has managed to hold a key support level at $0.33, which offers some relief to bullish investors. Additionally, on-chain metrics such as net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a more optimistic outlook. The recent uptick in whale activity could signal the beginning of a more sustained rise for the ADA price. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.354. The first target is a significant break above $0.40 before a return to $0.50. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Following this price rise, the altcoin moved its weekly profits to around 1.35% after what has been a turbulent trading week. However, certain market indicators signal the ETH market remains far from a bullish breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum TD Setup: Why The ETH Price Must Hold $2,250 Ethereum MVRV Far From Critical Bullish Level, Analyst Says  In an X post on Friday, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci shared an insight on the cyclical relationship between Ethereum’s price and its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which he states can be used to identify buy and sell signals.  According to Kesmeci, the last two bull and bear periods in the ETH market have revealed certain MVRV points i.e. 3.00 and 0.80 as vital to understanding price movement.  The analyst explains that an MVRV value above 3.00 usually results in Ethereum entering an overbought zone, presenting investors with an opportunity to sell in fear of a potential price fall.  Alternatively, historical data have shown ETH to be “relatively cheap” and undervalued when the MVRV value falls below 0.80, representing an opportunity for aggressive purchases by long-term investors.  However, In a more detailed analysis, Kesmeci highlights 2.25 to be a critical MVRV level in a bullish Ethereum market. The analyst states that significant price gains have been recorded whenever ETH moved past this MVRV value in the last two bull cycles. According to Kesmeci, Ethereum’s current MVRV stands at 1.22 following a decrease from 1.95 over the last 120 days. A continuous decline to below 0.80 would present a buy signal as earlier stated. However, investors should only anticipate a “serious rally” if the MVRV value moves upward and past 2.25.   Related Reading: Ethereum Could See a 53% Price Correction If This Happens—Analyst Key Ethereum Support Zone Revealed In other news, market analyst Ali Martinez has identified a key support level for Ethereum. According to data from IntoTheBlock, 2.4 million wallet addresses acquired $52.6 million worth of ETH at the $2,300 price mark.  Therefore a price fall below this region could trigger a panic market sale, resulting in a further price loss. At the time of writing, ETH trades at $2,458 with a 4.51% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the general market sentiment towards the altcoin remains largely bearish. This is reflected in the 13.21% decline in its daily trading volume currently valued at $13.45 billion. With a market cap of $293.36 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Featured image from The Guardian Nigeria, chart from Tradingview ",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Avalanche Rebounds: Eyes $29.35 Breakout And Further Gains,2024-10-12 17:00:11+00:00,"Avalanche (AVAX) has regained traction, showing signs of a potential bullish resurgence as it approaches a key resistance level at $29.35. After a period of consolidation, AVAX’s price action hints at a possible breakout, which could trigger a strong upward movement. With technical indicators showing signs of strength, the market’s focus now shifts to whether Avalanche can sustain this upward momentum and push past the $29.35 barrier for a sustained move higher. This analysis aims to evaluate Avalanche’s recent price rebound and assess whether it has the momentum to break through the key $29.35 resistance level. By examining technical indicators, market sentiment, and price trends, we seek to determine if the token is poised for further gains, setting the stage for a sustained rally in the coming sessions. AVAX’s Strong Bounce: Will Momentum Continue? Following the bullish comeback at $25, AVAX’s price on the 4-hour chart has continued to gain strength to surge toward the $29.35 resistance level. AVAX is also trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting a positive upward trend that could lead to a potential breakout. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that the signal line has risen above the 50% mark and is currently sitting at 74%, indicating strong bullish momentum. As long as the RSI remains elevated and buyers maintain control, the asset could experience additional gains with the possibility of reaching new highs. Related Reading: Can Avalanche (AVAX) Reclaim $30? Top Analyst Predicts A Dip Before A Bounce Additionally, the daily chart illustrates that AVAX is showcasing a significant upward push, characterized by a positive candlestick pattern following its rebound above the 100-day SMA. The asset is currently attempting to breach the critical resistance level at $29.35. Successfully overcoming this barrier would reinforce the prevailing upward trend and boost market sentiment, signaling heightened buying interest. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed examination of the RSI formation indicates that Avalanche may maintain its optimistic trajectory. The indicator’s signal line after dropping to 44% is rising again and is currently positioned at 59%,  indicating that buying pressure could remain strong and potentially drive further price appreciation in the near term. What’s Next For Avalanche If $29.35 Is Breached? If Avalanche successfully breaches the critical resistance level of $29.35, it could set the stage for a significant rally toward the $42 resistance mark. A breakout above this level could lead to a series of upward targets, pushing the price toward new highs as market confidence grows. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Ready To Target $28: Investors Expect A Reversal However, if Avalanche fails to maintain this strength and breaks above the $29.35 resistance level, it could result in a pullback, with the price sliding back toward the $18.85 support zone.

Notably, this price rise comes following a decline that saw the market leader trade below $59,000 on Thursday. While the market sentiment is currently bullish, certain conditions are needed to procure an actual bullish breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Bitcoin On The Brink Of Short-Term Bullish Run Following Bitcoin’s price ascent to around $62,000 on Friday, CryptoQuant analyst with the username Yonsei_dent shared a key insight on the asset’s potential price movement.  In a Quickake post, Yonsei_dent highlights $62,700 to be the key price level for short-term holders i.e. $62,700 represents the average price at which many short-holders acquired Bitcoin, which the analyst states has remained consistent for the last three months. Therefore, this presents a critical price level for BTC, a movement above which signals a change in a market shift and can spur buying activity from short-term holders. However, Yonsei_dent notes that Bitcoin needs to rise above $63,000 to initiate a significant bullish momentum over the coming weeks.   Since this price commentary, Bitcoin has traded above $63,000, albeit temporarily before retracing to around $62,300. This brief breakout can be traced to a lack of significant trading volume, a condition critical to the short-term bullish breakout deceived by Yonsei_dent. Currently, Bitcoin’s trading volume is valued at $30.75 billion, however, reflecting only a minor 2.94% gain in the last 24 hours.  If the price of BTC returned above $63,000 with a marked increase in trading activity, the premier cryptocurrency could rise to around $67,000, at which lies its next significant price resistance level.

Firstly, investors expect the Federal Reserve to implement a 25 basis points cut which would avail more liquidity for volatile assets such as Bitcoin.  Furthermore, the upcoming US elections have also gained significant influence in the crypto market with digital asset regulation becoming a major policy discussion.

Since early August, the price has struggled to hold above the crucial $0.36 level. This shift has left ADA in a precarious position, with investors and traders watching for signs of a potential recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Break Yearly Highs ‘Any Moment Now’ – Crypto Analyst Data from IntoTheBlock highlights a significant drop in whale activity over the past month, raising concerns about further downside pressure. The decrease in large transactions suggests that major holders may be stepping back, adding to the likelihood of a deeper correction for the altcoin. If ADA fails to break above the $0.36 resistance in the coming days, a 30% retrace to lower demand levels seems inevitable. Market participants are awaiting confirmation of either a breakout or further declines as the broader market remains uncertain. The next few days will be crucial for determining Cardano’s short-term direction. Cardano Whales Leaving Early? Cardano is at a crucial liquidity level, with on-chain metrics indicating a potential for further decline, especially given the significant decrease in whale activity. Recent data from IntoTheBlock highlights a concerning trend: ADA whales, or large investors, have increasingly sold their holdings over the past month. This trend is evident in the 100% fall in ADA’s large holders’ netflow, which refers to the balance between the amount of the coin these addresses buy and the amount they sell. Large holders are addresses with over 0.1% of Cardano’s circulating supply. When the flow declines, these investors sell more coins than they buy, signaling a potential loss of confidence in Cardano. This lack of confidence often trickles down to retail investors, leading them to sell their holdings. The drop in ADA’s whale concentration over the past month confirms this selling activity, raising concerns about ‘Smart Money’ potentially exiting the Cardano ecosystem. If this trend continues, it could push ADA below its current liquidity level, resulting in a deeper correction. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as the exit of large holders could signal a bearish sentiment that may lead to a significant price decline. As Cardano navigates this critical phase, investors will watch for signs of recovery or further weakness in the coming days. Key Levels To Watch  Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.35 after experiencing days of choppy price action below the critical $0.36 resistance level. The price is 15% below the 1D 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.40, a key area of resistance that bulls must overcome to reverse the prevailing downtrend. This crucial level was lost in April, and since then, ADA has failed to close above it four times. If the price continues to struggle, a deeper correction to fresh yearly lows at $0.25 could be in store. Such a move would represent a significant 30% retracement from current levels, further intensifying bearish sentiment in the market. Investors are aware of these critical price points, as a failure to reclaim the EMA and break through the $0.36 resistance may lead to increased selling pressure. Related Reading: Can SUI Fall To $1.40?

According to the pundit, the premier cryptocurrency looked set for a bullish breakout — albeit not in a straightforward move. In his forecast, Martinez said that the price layout (at the time) could see Bitcoin fall to the $60,000 level and then make a comeback to $66,000.

If a breakout occurs to the upside of the upper trendline, it may imply a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Meanwhile, a breakout across the bottom trendline is a trend continuation signal. In a new post on the X platform, Martinez provided an update on the $78,000 forecast, confirming that the Bitcoin price dropped to $60,000 before jumping back to $66,000. Following the latest correction to around $59,000, the next move for the premier cryptocurrency seems to be the breakout rally to $78,000. Contrary to general expectations, the price of Bitcoin has not exactly shined in the historically bullish month of October. However, this latest projection shows that the “Uptober” month could just be starting for the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin sits just beneath $63,000, reflecting a 5% increase in the past 24 hours. This latest rally represents a price recovery as the premier cryptocurrency has been under intense bearish pressure over the past week, falling as low as $59,000 at some point. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin is up by 1% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Over 52 Million ETH Bought At $2,300, Will Ethereum Bulls Defend This Support?

After a modest 5% pump on Friday, investors and analysts are increasingly optimistic about the direction Solana could take in the coming months.  One prominent analyst, Carl Runefelt, has shared a technical analysis predicting a 20% surge for SOL in the next few weeks, citing bullish patterns and favorable market conditions. His analysis suggests that Solana could reach $176 by the end of the year if current momentum holds. Related Reading: Dogecoin Targets $0.11 As Short-Term Traders Fuel DOGE Price – Details However, Solana still faces key resistance levels that could challenge its upward trajectory. Despite the recent surge, some market participants are cautious, given the overall volatility in the crypto space. If Solana manages to maintain its current support and break through resistance, the next few months could be pivotal for the asset’s long-term price action. Can SOL capitalize on its recent gains and reach new highs, or will it struggle to maintain momentum in the face of market headwinds? Investors are eager to see how this plays out as we approach the end of the year. Solana Testing Supply Levels Solana has been trading within a range of $210 to $110 since mid-March, leading to mixed opinions among investors. While some see this price action as a consolidation phase, others believe it could signal an upcoming breakout. Notably, top analyst and entrepreneur Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing a bullish triangle pattern forming for SOL. According to Runefelt’s analysis, if Solana breaks out of this triangle pattern, it could experience a sharp upward movement, potentially reaching $176 in the coming weeks. This would represent a significant surge from its current trading levels and a key milestone for SOL. The price has struggled to break through the $160 resistance level since early August, but Runefelt suggests that a breakout from the triangle could push the price well beyond this resistance. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Testing $0.34 Support – On-Chain Data Suggests Price Consolidation A successful break above these critical levels would mean a 20% surge for Solana, with bullish momentum potentially driving it even higher. Investors are closely watching these movements, as a breakout could signal the end of Solana’s extended sideways trading and mark the start of a new upward trend. If SOL can maintain support and continue this rally, it may soon test new highs and solidify its position as one of the top-performing altcoins. SOL Technical Analysis: Zones To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $145, following a 7% surge from local lows at $135. The price has managed to rise above the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $140, a key indicator of short-term trend strength. However, SOL is still 4% away from the crucial 200 moving average (MA) at $152, which represents a stronger, longer-term trend signal. A breakout above both the EMA and MA levels is essential for bulls to fully regain control and reclaim the trend. Surpassing these indicators could pave the way for a move to the $160 supply zone, where sellers are expected to be more active. This would signal a continuation of bullish momentum, with potential for further gains. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details On the other hand, if the price fails to hold above the $140 mark, this recent surge could be short-lived, and a deeper correction might follow. A break below this level could drive SOL down to $110, which is a significant demand zone that buyers may defend. Traders are keeping a close eye on these levels as the next few days will determine SOL’s s`hort-term direction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Trump-Backed DeFi Project Set To Launch WLFI Token Sale October 15,2024-10-12 07:00:50+00:00,"Former President Donald Trump foray into decentralized finance (DeFi) with his initiative, World Liberty Financial, has officially begun onboarding users, with a public sale of its WLFI token scheduled for October 15.  This announcement comes as the project aims to raise $300 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion through its initial token offering, which garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. The Trump DeFi Initiative In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), World Liberty Financial announced that the public sale will be open to individuals who qualify through a whitelist process. The governance token, WLFI, will have a non-transferable status for the first 12 months, although it will allow holders to participate in voting on platform decisions immediately. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? The initial phase of the project includes launching a DeFi lending platform, modeled after Aave, on Scroll, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. It will initially support Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, with future plans to introduce a stablecoin-focused credit card, facilitate integration with exchanges for seamless asset transfers, and fractionalize real-world assets like hotels and clubs. World Liberty Financial is presented as a key component of Trump’s vision to “Make America great again, this time with crypto.” The initiative aims to position the US as the leading global hub for cryptocurrency, enhancing financial security and enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries through decentralized finance.  However, specific functionalities and a definitive launch date for the platform have yet to be announced. Interestingly, a preliminary white paper for the project includes a disclaimer stating that World Liberty Financial is “not owned, managed, operated or sold” by the Trump family, although it notes that they may receive compensation from the initiative. This disclaimer aims to clarify the project’s structure amidst ongoing scrutiny. Political Polarization Ahead? The launch of World Liberty Financial has raised expectations among investors, but it has also raised eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community, particularly within industry leaders such as Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of the Ethereum and Cardano blockchains.  Hoskinson has expressed concerns that Trump’s DeFi venture could become a “political flashpoint,” exacerbating existing tensions surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in the US under Biden’s administration.  Related Reading: BNB Under Siege: Failed Recovery Sparks Fears of Deeper Losses Hoskinson also warned that the political polarization surrounding Trump could provoke a backlash from Democrats that could threaten the viability of the initiative. The Cardano founder indicated that if Democrats perceive Trump’s DeFi project as a significant threat, they might leverage governmental power to impose restrictions, potentially driving many crypto projects offshore to jurisdictions with more favorable regulations.  Despite his concerns, Hoskinson acknowledged that it has attracted influential investors and advocates. However, he remains skeptical about whether this support will translate into effective policy changes should Trump regain power.

Reddit,solana,Just launched: Jupiter On iOS!,2024-10-12 17:15:55,"Hey everyone, meow from Jupiter here! 

We recently finally launched our mobile app, and wanted to share a few thoughts with everyone.

For the first version, we focused on achieving 3 simple things:

1. The best mobile swap experience in crypto, with zero configuration, zero platform fees and auto retries
2. Focused onramp to Solana, with Apple Pay, Credit Card, etc
3. All the tokens you can possibly want to trade in Solana from the newest Pump tokens to the most OG coins - all sorted, verifed and easily searchable.

It certainly took much longer than we wanted to, with endless tweaks to make the decentralized swap as smooth as we wanted it to, testing out multiple onramp partners, getting the needed backend services to work well, building and dropping many features and of course getting it live.

We have a lot more work to get it to be more unique, usable and useful, but in the meantime, if anyone has any feedback, will love to know how we can do better and build it as a community!",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

I'm not aiming for 100x, but rather somewhat established coins that have high potential to double within like a few days. These coins can't have a marketcap as high or be as old as Popcat, but also can't have too low marcetcap either or just launched projects. I'd say I'm looking for SOL coins that are at least 1 week old (preferably multiple) to minimize the risk of rugpulls, and their marketcap must be high enough for the coin to be sustainable but still low enough for there to be doubling potential in value within a few days.

Reddit,solana,my observation of coins from which the Dev buys 100% bounding curve from the start.,2024-10-12 09:53:20,"So I periodically observe such launches several times a day on pumpfun. Dev buys up the entire curve and the coin is going to Raydium, the launch is always from new wallets, so there is no chance to snipe. But this dev is not a fool (but a scammer) and in TG bots there is an opportunity to snipe coins before entering Ray. Therefore, immediately after the listing, the coin is sold out (already from a large number of wallets) MK falls by 30-70%. Then again there is a purchase of the coin by many wallets (buyers are attracted), then again a dump, this can be repeated several times(so-called market making). As a result, the dev comes out in about 15 minutes and a new coin is launched in same way. What is interesting is that sometimes such coins make a market cap of 500-1000k, but more often about 80-100k. 
    All this is convenient to observe on [pumpscreener.online](http://pumpscreener.online), probably I would not have noticed it otherwise.

Reddit,solana,Executing Raydium swaps with Python,2024-10-12 07:34:32,"Hey everyone, 

Has anyone managed to figure out a way to systematically send orders to Raydium via python? I've done a bit of research and looks like there is an API but that uses JS/TS. 

It also seems that Jupiter has an API that can be used, but what are the benefits of using this? It seems like new tokens are slow to appear on there sometimes. Can I also just route orders directly to Raydium via Jupiter? 

Another option is to piggy-back off the various trading bots (Trojan, Bonk, etc). But this looks like I'd have to build a custom flow to interact with the TG bots - do any of these have an API like access? I don't mind the fees for now if its easy to implement. 

Thanks! ",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,solana,Improving transaction reception speed on a private RPC,2024-10-11 13:26:28,"I am running my own private RPC node with the Geyser plugin and Jito Shred Stream. I am monitoring some token accounts, and sometimes the transactions involving the token accounts I am watching are delayed for reasons I have not been able to determine.

I am logging the transaction handling timestamp (with milliseconds), and there is almost a \~1-second difference between the network's timestamp and when I handle it.

I know that transaction timestamps do not have millisecond precision. Let me provide an example to clarify:

Let's say a transaction occurred on the network at 12:00:00. According to my logs, I handled it at 12:00:01.750. Even if the transaction happened at the last millisecond of 12:00:00, it is still almost 750 ms delayed, which is equivalent to nearly 2 block times.

I would like to know what areas could be improved to reduce this delay.

I have been monitoring the server for a long time everything seems normal. no iowait, no swap usage, or memory congestion, cpu usage is around %50.

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-10-11 02:25:45,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Long story short, the launch didn’t go well and the project didn’t take off at all. I am a noob in the field and I just ended up selling all my coins and called it a day after an hour. In between time, some random guy with a big account on twitter (<100k followers) reached to me via the twitter account I had made for the project. He asked me if I wanted to relaunch it with his support. He says he likes the meme and thinks it could do well (I tend to agree). He says he has a specific strat in place regarding the launch itself and that he can help promote and market the project for free and that he is ready to work for his bag. I am supposed to have a call with the guy tomorrow but what do you guys think of this? I find this approach a bit sus myself and would appreciate your opinion on this.

That's all folks! The Solana 📡 Radar Hackathon has come to an end.

The Colosseum team is organizing all the submissions and preparing to start the judging process, which should take 3-4 weeks.

The total number of submissions and a public directory will be published soon.

Here's the rest of the news...

### 📜 State of Solana: Breakpoint Edition

At Breakpoint 2024 the Solana Foundation released its first-ever **State of the Solana Ecosystem** report outlining major milestones and exciting developments.

Some of the highlights include:

**Institutional Adoption and Tokenization:** Solana is seeing accelerated adoption by institutional players, with new tokenization projects from Franklin Templeton, Securitize (partnering with BlackRock’s BUIDL), and Societe Generale. 

**Mobile App Development:** 2024 is a breakthrough year for mobile app development on Solana.

Major new mobile apps include:

* Jupiter: A leading DeFi aggregator expanding to mobile.
* DRiP: A social app built on Solana.
* PhotoFinish LIVE: A mobile-based horse racing game.

Solana’s mobile focus is also growing with the release of [Solana Mobile’s Seeker](https://blog.colosseum.org/solana-seeker-encode-bootcamp-worldid/) phone and Jambo’s JamboPhone. These devices and apps are creating opportunities for developers to build mobile-first experiences.

**Cross-Border Payments and Stablecoins:** The Solana payments ecosystem continues to expand, with launches such as Sling for cross-border payments, PayFi, and debit cards powered by Solana-based stablecoins.

**Decentralized Energy Sector (DePIN):** The DePIN sector is still growing on Solana, focusing on solutions for the energy crisis. 

Notable projects like Project Zero (a decentralized renewable energy network) and Powerledger migrating to Solana, highlight the intersection of blockchain and renewable energy. 

**Funding and Hackathons:** Solana projects raised $173 million in Q3 2024, the highest since Q2 2022, signaling a strong commitment to early-stage development. 

Additionally, participation in developer events like Colosseum’s hackathons has surged, with a 36% increase in registrations for the Radar hackathon compared to Arena. 

With increasing funding, hackathon participation, and new opportunities, Solana continues to give developers a dynamic ecosystem to build the future of Web3.

### 🖇️ Blinks Action Chaining

Dialect has rolled out new Blinks capabilities, including Action Chaining, Advanced Input Types, and Multichain Compatibility across major wallets like Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, OKX, ByBit, and more.

Action Chaining is the star feature of this update, letting developers create multi-step processes within a single Blink.

For example, you can now guide users through filling in shipping details, making a purchase, and entering a follow-up email, all in one streamlined flow.

Developers just need to add a next attribute in the links section of the *ActionPostResponse*. This small change unlocks the power to build complex user experiences across any app or service, such as voting on governance, making purchases, or engaging in DeFi actions anywhere the link is shared.

For more technical details and a step-by-step guide, check out [Dialect's documentation](https://docs.dialect.to/documentation/actions/actions/action-chaining?ref=blog.colosseum.org).

### 🌐 Spherenet

Sphere has unveiled Spherenet, a permissioned, privacy-focused distributed ledger built using a modified SVM.

It's designed to provide a bridge between traditional finance systems and blockchains for financial institutions that must comply with regulatory frameworks.

By integrating compliance features directly into its architecture, Spherenet allows developers to create DeFi solutions that meet stringent global financial regulations, including KYC and AML requirements.

Another advantage for developers is the ability to build privacy-preserving apps, thanks to Spherenet’s integration of ZK proofs and other cryptographic technologies.

Spherenet also provides integration of fiat funding through stablecoin bridging mechanisms, allowing developers to create solutions that facilitate cross-border payments and settlements, and fiat on/off ramps that work with traditional systems in a compliant way.

For DeFi developers looking to build applications that bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, Spherenet provides the regulatory compliance, privacy, and stability required to attract institutional users.

Reddit,solana,Phantom Wallet  - Alert to Users -,2024-10-10 23:09:49,"This is for the Phantom Wallet users.  My Phantom wallet was hacked and I believe I discovered a big hole in that wallet's security.

\*\* I'm alerting users that have a Phantom Wallet to change the password immediately to something unique (a new password never used before). Apparently, PW is more important than your ""seed words"".

I contacted Phantom about the hack, and their technical team responded with a ton of typical questions about where I shared my seed words, who I shared them with... They also try to insinuate in these questions that my computer was hacked and the seed words were stolen that way. My seed words were on a piece of paper in my safe.

What got me was that one question they ask: ""Where do you store the seed words where someone could access them?""  

My answer was the Phantom Wallet.  The wallet itself. 

Please correct me if I'm off on the science. If you know about Sol blockchain code, put it on the chopping block.   But I think I was able to piece together how this hack was done.

I narrowed it down to two things ---> 1. An Inside Job or 2. A Password Hole.

The Hack:  My wallet fell prey to that scam we've seen on reddit b4, where the wallet gets hacked and they drain any sol that's in the account or sent to it. All sol deposits immediately get resent to the hacker's wallet address.  Since the sol balance always stays empty, any tokens on that wallet are stuck forever (or until the hacker gets around to it).  Luckily I only lost about $40 on this wallet.

The Password Hole: Since my seed words are in cold storage, the only way to access the wallet was using the password login. What I discovered is you can access your seed words and your private key in the wallet's settings.  You just need to re-enter the password.

The Method: I have hypothesized that hackers are buying PW lists off the black market (these are those stolen password breaches we hear in the news frequently). They initiate a crawl algo that runs every stolen password against every SOL address in the blockchain.  All they need is your stolen pw and the wallet address. If a hacker crawls millions of addresses, it could add up quite a bit. That then allows them to add the automated botcode/extensions/scripts to the wallet.

Stealing my password was the only way this could have happened. It could have happened through a Dapp, which is a possibility. 

To protect myself from this, I do things a little different. I now disconnect when not in use. Once I do my business, I immediately disconnect and ""unallow"" the Dapp access in the phantom settings.

Is it normal to have access to your seed words from the digital wallet's settings? I dunno, Davey.

I told Phantom this. I asked them to look into removing the seed words from settings in the wallet.  I also told them I now anticipate a 50/50 chance of my Phantom wallet getting hacked. They haven't responded since.  I think they might've got offended by my possible ""inside job"" theory.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,solana,My crypto were stolen from my phantom wallet. Please help,2024-10-08 19:33:21,"Good afternoon community

A couple of hours ago today I had 36000 Hammy tokens stolen from a phantom wallet. I never interacted with any malicious site or signed contracts from strangers. I also never opened any scam nft. So I can't understand how I was robbed and I am afraid that I will be emptied of more accounts from the same seed phrase. Although I already moved most of my funds to binance. I think it might have been through TG since 3 hours ago I decided to invest in the NOW token. Going to the Pumpfun website. I saw among the comments that someone posted the TG link of a supposed CTO of the coin, so I opened it to take a look.

[That is the comment](https://preview.redd.it/hmtmhpa81ltd1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=08a76a8615a422e5cbfc388505b275997a6567fc)

When I opened it, it asked me to do a verification like most TG groups, with the difference that in this one it asked me to scan a QR code, I was stupid and scanned it and I didn't get into any group, so I forgot about it. Half an hour later I started to check my wallets and saw that I was missing 36000 Hammy tokens and I feared the worst...so I checked my transaction history and realized that indeed they had been stolen.I couldn't explain it because as I explained before I always avoid misusing my wallet. So I guess it had to be because of the qr code I scanned from TG. When I checked the sessions I realized from telegram that I had an open session on a device in Paris, France (I am from Mexico). So I guess that's how they managed to steal my tokens, since the theft happened a few minutes after I foolishly scanned that QR code.

[This is the unknown session in telegram. Opened a few minutes before the robbery](https://preview.redd.it/ofvdbbbj3ltd1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5b615984c94348471949e0b73bbfd3e4d4f062)

I know it is impossible to recover the tokens. I just want to ask for help to know if the theft was as I believe it was done, or by some malicious software that slipped in without me realizing it. Right now I don't know whether to format my pc, delete my TG account. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Hello, I needed access to my Coinbase account so I could pull tax documents and filled out the form for someone to contact me because Coinbase don’t have a number listed. Within a minute I was contacted by someone by the name of Ryan Roy stating he was with Coinbase support. It seemed like he had quite a bit of information and nothing seemed out of place so he assisted us over the course of a week to get the issue resolved. He would help us get verified and walked us thru everything and said he needed to get the right computers linked up and that we had to many currently linked which is why we were always getting locked out of our account. He was able to name the computers connected to the account and we needed to make sure each computer was verified. He worked with us for a while for a week. 

Long story short- he stole all our cryptocurrency. 

There were so many red flags and I am so upset for not trusting my gut!!!

Reddit,ethereum,Can layer 2 scalability really undermine Ethereum’s value?,2024-10-12 08:15:40,"Lately, I’ve been seeing more and more posts, mostly on X, explaining why, in their opinion, it’s now certain that the price of ETH can only go down. 

Their argument is that Ethereum’s scalability, based on L2, leads to a growing reduction in users who rely on L1, and that the fees paid by L2s to L1 are extremely low (almost free), which translates into lower revenues for L1. So if the L2s roadmap plays out, it would basically result in a divergence between Ethereum L1 utility (increasing by number of users on L2s settling on Ethereum) and ETH price (decreasing by lower fees geenrated for L1).

Another argument that’s often heard is that the most successful L2s in the medium/long term will completely detach from Ethereum, becoming independent L1s and taking their user base with them.

Regarding this last argument, I find it unlikely since the value of Ethereum lies precisely in its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance, and that’s not something L2s can easily achieve overnight. So, unless an L2 wants to become a centralized L1 like others, it wouldn’t make sense to detach from Ethereum.

As for the first argument, the issue of fees paid by L2s to settle transactions on L1 is definitely relevant. Currently, they are very low, but that doesn’t mean it can’t change in the future. After all, Ethereum’s main value is to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant layer for settling transactions. Being the only chain with these characteristics, aside from perhaps Bitcoin, Ethereum L1 should charge appropriate fees to L2s for settlement.

Though, it's still sketchy how secured and valuable LST and LRTs could be. With the new Puffer protocol, however, LRTs model might have evolved to become an Integral part of the ecosystem.

an exploration of the commons scale goods that make Ethereum (network, asset, media), what underpins their integrity, and how [u/ProtocolGuild](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild) can help with that

*Thanks to* [*Barnabé*](https://x.com/barnabemonnot)*,* [*John*](https://x.com/jszcz_)*,* [*Josh*](https://x.com/TBSocialist)*,* [*Paul*](https://x.com/post_polar_)*, and* [*Tim*](https://x.com/TimBeiko) *for review.*

Ethereum is a commons like the natural + digital ones that precede it: fisheries, forests, the internet, Linux, etc. Commons are productive systems which create resources for collective benefit

Ethereum's three shared resources: network, asset, media

their confluence produces what we call Ethereum mainnet: they are deeply interdependent here, but altered forms make the edges of the broader commons

these resources are produced through protocols: technical, legal, economic, social, political

complete ownership of each resource is not desirable, as it destroys their integrity. therefore, actors engage in production for influence extraction

Protocol Guild gives us a transparent, legible, sustainable and accountable funding allocation mechanism for software media production. there are 5 main threads which make it unique:

1. narrow mandate
2. broad self-curation
3. members are individuals
4. 4yr onchain vesting contract
5. designed with time in mind

it holistically funds stewardship of the entire watershed - not rivers in isolation

Commons have had a rough go under capitalism - but there is hope in long-lived natural precedents: irrigation, fisheries, farming.

blossoming digital commons should practice the posture and develop the mechanisms necessary to ensure uncaptured longevity

Reddit,ethereum,What is the ethereum platform (in the context of purchasing goods on the internet) ,2024-10-10 18:26:32,"Hey guys, total newbie (although I am technically invested in ethereum lol) and I want to buy something on the internet that requires me to pay in ethereum, more specifically, from the “ethereum platform” itself. What does this mean? I paid via ethereum from
My coinbase wallet and that was not sufficient. 

“Hello Sir, Ethereum is the main network for ETH and is independent of any platform. You should be able to pay from any wallet but choose the Network -> Ethereum. This means that the transaction will appear in ETH blockchain here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x466D0713Fb2aE827751402f68f81BA2F7d5Ec5F0”

These were the instructions, but I’m unclear as to how that’s not the same as me paying via ethereum on the coinbase app. Do I got to this website to make the transaction? He said I could pay from any wallet…

Anyways if anyone is willing to explain this to me like I’m 5 so I don’t lose more money, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! ",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

I have never owned ETH, or had any coin account for that matter before this. I was reached out to my email by someone wanting to purcahce my artwork. The website they wanted me to mint on had a gas fee (0.1eth) but I wasn't able to mint because I didn't actually own any eth.

I told them this, and then I was able to get them to send 0.2 eth to my account to be able to mint these artworks online.

I keep reading that these sites ask for a fee and then the art never gets bought so then you just lose the money you paid for the ghas fee, but I didn't even pay for the minting fee, which is why i'm not sure if it is a scam or not.

Then I sent $62.71 and she received $48. It was night time in the USA so I don’t think the gas rates were crazy. But it’s wild that I bought $116 worth and she only received $84.

I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses and I was unable to really see what he’s doing because I was really feeling ill for the past month.

The story goes like this. Some guys scam him to invest in crypto and to withdraw the money he had to keep adding. I reported them to the police but they did nothing.

Fast forward he found a lawyer on facebook and the guy said he will help him out in return of 8% of the money he will get back. Same thing, he fooled him into investing into crypto, then he said he needed to invest another 1000$ because the money had to go into a mixer. My dad did. 

I got better and I did some research on this guy, he uses a fake name and a picture of a lawyer from canada but pretends he’s from the UK. 

Now he’s asking for another 1200$ for this mixer thing which I am sure is a scam. He left my dad broke and in debt and my dad is in a war zone, things are hard enough. 

I did some research but it is truly out of my area of expertise, I don’t know how trust wallet works, but I am not stupid.

The guy claims that revolut refused the money because they were dirty, but we were using my mom’s account which he couldn’t have had access to. So how would he know that? Except that it is a lie to scam my dad?

I am sure that the money that went into the mixer went into his wallet in fact. He also told my dad that he won 18000 $ somehow which is a far strech so he would invest more.

Please help me out here. 

What is this scam? How can I explain it to my dad? ",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781
Reddit,ethereum,Plans to reduce block rewards or raise the the burn rate?,2024-10-08 06:00:30,"Hey all,
Since blobs got introduced and regular users moved to L2s, there are way lower gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem. Time to celebrate, right?
The downside of this is a constantly increasing ETH supply and the fear, that ETH isn't seen as a good investment anymore. I know that inflation of Bitcoin is still higher rn but Bitcoins supply is capped, while ETHs is infinite.

Imo it is important for ETH to be seen as a store of value (besides all it's functionality) to attract new users. There is also the risk of the old users slowly fading away, because they feel this spiral of: less new users > more supply > falling price.

I am interested in the thoughts and discussions around this topic from the community, but especially the devs pov.

This is a follow-up to my post from about a month ago.

First, I want to clarify that I'm still bullish on Ethereum. I continue to dollar-cost average (DCA) into ETH, and I'm very close to setting up my own Ethereum node to help support the Ethereum blockchain.

My previous inquiry was about the number of developers building on the Ethereum platform. According to data from 2023, Ethereum is far ahead of other platforms in terms of developer activity, which is great news:

Read this: [https://www.developerreport.com/](https://www.developerreport.com/)

(Please let me know where I can find more up-to-date data for 2024). 

However, this leads me to a new question: While having numerous developers is positive, what tangible benefits will these developers bring to the ecosystem? In your opinion, what types of applications and use cases will they produce for the future of the project?

Reddit,ethereum,"When using Groth16 on Ethereum through ᴇɪᴘ‒197, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-05 21:22:04,"First remember Ethereum only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result… Otherwise I recognize this is more a mathematical problem but the place where I’m the most likely to find someone who do understand it remains on Ethereum as it’s partly cryptocurrency math specific.

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The trusted setup publishes

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

Reddit,ethereum,I got hacked and stolen $45K off my wallet,2024-10-04 07:37:30,"I’m a video editor/programmer who with another guy online started to develop an editing tool that we were planning on selling. We had already started developing the tool and I knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online).

About 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and I downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (I know it’s dumb I don’t need to be lectured about it I know). That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money. I don’t know what I’m gonna do from there, I’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and I was supposed to go to University next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone.

EDIT: I will try to take legal actions but I really don't expect anything, as for the people saying I should have had a hardware wallet, I know. I also saw a lot of people claiming I was rich which is hilarious, I'm an immigrant from Senegal to Canada my parents are middle class workers (Accountant and Oceanographer) that struggled to give us good life opportunities so yes $45K is a lot of money. This is a part of the money I've invested being a video editor and held in ETH since 2-3 years, I'm not rich. Thank you for everyone sending me nice words of support, I needed that.

EDIT 2: I bought a Ledger wallet to stock the BTC I had on another hot wallet, I’m not making the same mistake again. I want to thank you guys again for the nice/wise words my brothers and sisters, it has helped cope a bit better with my situation although I still feel horrible about the whole thing. As for the ETH it’s gone, I don’t think I’ll ever see it again and although I still have a bit of money left, I’ll have to make it all over again but as some of you guys said I’ve done it once I can do it again and better.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

🔗 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

But what would happen if it would be the cases as it’s happening on some implementation that use the Ethereum’s ᴇɪᴘ‐197 precompile ? There are clear examples on how to forge proofs when there’s no public inputs or they are allowed to be all 0 but are there security risk when public inputs are used and if yes how this can be done ?",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

I mean I don't think this would work:

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,ethereum,Does crypto arbitrage on dex even work?,2024-09-24 13:34:33,"I can not find a lot of tokens that are listed on multiple decentralized exchanges where I can make some lucrative money with.

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Im a fresh crypto/BTC beginner working on a rough draft explaining bitcoin to other beginners that reads - but mostly myself. Would someone point out any glaring inaccuracies in anything I’ve written so far? Much appreciate in advance! ,2024-10-12 21:47:27,"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, an intangible digital asset whose value stems from the demand of those who wish to possess the rewards generated by the solving of cryptographic puzzles, whether they are aware of it or not.

That’s right. The first bitcoins were produced when Satoshi Nakamoto’s computer solved a cryptographic puzzle. These initial coins served as a reward for providing computational power to create a new block in the blockchain (will expand on these terms later). Have you ever heard the phrase ‘mining bitcoin’? This is essentially what Satoshi Nakamoto and all other bitcoin miners have done to increase their bitcoin balance and fortunes. Simply put, mining is the process of using computational power to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. Successfully solving these puzzles and demonstrating their solution is known as ‘proof-of-work.’ 

We need to hold off on discussing blocks and the blockchain for now, as these are protective mechanisms implemented by the Bitcoin network to solve important problems. For now, let’s focus on bitcoin and their transactions. Imagine you are a bitcoin miner. When your computer successfully establishes a new block after solving a puzzle, you become the beneficiary and owner of a certain number of bitcoins. This allocation of bitcoins to you constitutes a transaction—the network (payer) has rewarded you (payee) with X number of bitcoin (good ole' money).

Let’s take a look at a more familiar example: Bob transacts with Alice. He initiates a transfer of $10 to her. Bob’s wallet is debited $10, and Alice is credited $10. This transaction has a few components: a debit and a credit. A bitcoin transaction has a similar structure, except debits and credits are referred to as inputs and outputs. Remember this distinction. 

Recall the first bitcoins mined by Satoshi; this involved a transaction where the network paid Satoshi, the payee. In this transaction, the bitcoin assigned to Satoshi is the output, but more specifically, it is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). These UTXOs are the bitcoins that Satoshi, or any miner/beneficiary, can spend and exchange for goods and services. In essence, UTXOs = bitcoin. Miners are given rewards that equate to UTXOs, which in turn represent bitcoin. Rewards, UTXOs, and bitcoins are all one and the same.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

we know this because of Bitcoin's pre determined supply schedule.

Currently there are 19.76M BTC in circulation. Every single one on those Bitcoin are owned and controlled by an entity. The entity either has control of the private key, or they do not. Meaning, that if that Bitcoin is to be accessed, it must be transferred or sold by the one who controls the private key.

There are no bitcoin sitting on the shelves, awaiting an owner. All coins are either owned or yet to be mined.

In 2026, we will reach the pivotal point of ""The Last Million"". It will be monumental. Please ensure friends and family know about bitcoin before this moment. Because if this doesn't wake a person up to the scarcity and continuity of bitcoin, then what will.

With 450 being released per day, we art set to reach epoch 6 in 2028. There will be a total mined supply of 20,343,750 BTC.

There will ONLY be 656,250 (3.125%) Bitcoin left to mine up to 2140.  

And whats crazy is that just half of that will be set to be released between 2028-2032.

* 328,125 over 4 years 
* 82,031.25 per year
* 225 per day.

An entire planet of people, positioned on the other side of the information game, fighting against a group of die hard bitcoiners who are already taking from the little pie that is left and still adding to their own. How unfair. 

The game only gets harder in 2032. Where we reduce to an epoch emission of \~ 164,062 BTC.

Only 41,015 BTC per year

What would you pay to be an owner of one of these 41,015? By then Bitcoin would have been around 23 years. Still undefeated. Still securing the wealth of network participants.

  
The ownership of bitcoin merely requires the passage of time. and time ticks on block by block..

By 2034, we will be at 99% supply mined.

Think fast. Be patient. Stack sats. Be humbled.

- I generated 1 address (Address A) and sent few BTC to it ;
- Then I generated another address from the same seed (Address B) and sent few BTC to it.

=> With this only information, is it possible to link my 2 addresses and know that they belong to the same person?
=> If privacy is not yet broken, will it be when I'll send Bitcoin out of one of the addresses? Is there anything I could do to prevent this?

Hello, I needed access to my Coinbase account so I could pull tax documents and filled out the form for someone to contact me because Coinbase don’t have a number listed. Within a minute I was contacted by someone by the name of Ryan Roy stating he was with Coinbase support. It seemed like he had quite a bit of information and nothing seemed out of place so he assisted us over the course of a week to get the issue resolved. He would help us get verified and walked us thru everything and said he needed to get the right computers linked up and that we had to many currently linked which is why we were always getting locked out of our account. He was able to name the computers connected to the account and we needed to make sure each computer was verified. He worked with us for a while for a week. 

Long story short- he stole all our cryptocurrency.

Reddit,bitcoin,A rational case for bitcoin,2024-10-12 15:55:47,"For those new to the scene thinking about bitcoin as an investment but who may be reluctant, let’s make a rational case for bitcoin. There is a lot of FUD floating around these days… the technology has stagnated, it’s zero sum game, etc. 

To start, let’s dissect the role of fiat creation, how this new money flows into the economy, and why investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against the impact of fiat creation. We can break it down into a few key points:

1. USD Creation and Federal Government Monetary Policy

The Federal Reserve controls the supply of USD, primarily through mechanisms like quantitative easing (QE), interest rates, and the purchase of assets like government bonds. In times of economic need or crisis, the Federal Reserve prints new money to inject liquidity into the economy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, trillions of dollars were created to stimulate the economy.

This newly created money is introduced into the financial system through various means, such as stimulus packages, lending facilities, or bond-buying programs. The idea is to spur spending, investment, and economic growth by making money more available and lowering borrowing costs. The result of this process is an increase in the overall money supply—often referred to as M2, which includes cash, deposits, and easily convertible short-term assets. We see M2 increasing now, due to current fiscal policy. 

2. Flow of Money into the Economy

Newly created dollars flow into the hands of banks, businesses, and individuals through lending, government spending, and financial markets. This money circulates throughout the economy, funding infrastructure, corporate investments, consumer spending, and more. Over time, the continuous injection of money into the economy can dilute the value of existing dollars, resulting in inflation. As inflation rises, the purchasing power of each dollar declines, meaning goods and services become more expensive relative to a dollar held today.

3. The Problem: Inflation and Currency Devaluation

Inflation is an inherent feature of fiat currencies like the USD due to the expansionary nature of modern monetary policy. While moderate inflation is considered normal, the risk is that large-scale money creation can lead to hyperinflation or a significant erosion of wealth. The value of the USD is not fixed but continually fluctuates based on policy decisions, economic factors, and government debt levels. Over time, this erodes the purchasing power of savings held in USD.

For example, the value of the dollar has decreased by over 95% since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, which means that what you could buy with $1 back then would now cost over $25.

4. Why Investors Turn to Bitcoin: A Hedge Against Monetary Expansion

Bitcoin, in contrast to the USD, has a fixed supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, as governed by its underlying protocol. Unlike the USD, Bitcoin cannot be printed or manipulated by central banks or governments. This limited supply makes Bitcoin deflationary in nature, meaning it appreciates in value over time as demand increases and supply remains constant.

Investors view Bitcoin as a store of value similar to gold. As more money is created, and the purchasing power of fiat currencies declines, Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature offer protection from inflationary pressures. Bitcoin allows investors to opt-out of the traditional financial system, which is heavily influenced by government policies. By holding Bitcoin, investors protect their wealth from the devaluation that occurs when more fiat currency is introduced into the economy.

Hedging against uncertainty: The continual printing of USD and the potential for future crises or unsustainable debt levels create uncertainty in traditional financial systems. Bitcoin, by contrast, is governed by code, and its supply is known and predictable, making it an attractive hedge.

5. Bitcoin is Not a Zero-Sum Game

A zero-sum game implies that for someone to win, someone else must lose. Bitcoin, however, offers an opportunity for individuals to participate in a system that grows over time, primarily due to M2 expansion. Additionally, As Bitcoin adoption increases globally, and as it becomes more integrated into financial systems, the value of the network itself grows (similar to how the internet expanded).

Bitcoin’s rise in value isn’t about taking wealth from others but about creating an alternative financial system where value is derived from its adoption, utility, and protection against inflation. The Bitcoin network is open to all, and those who invest early benefit from the long-term increase in value as its network effect grows.

Conclusion: Why Bitcoin?

The USD’s continual creation by the Federal Reserve leads to a slow erosion of purchasing power due to inflation. This isn’t inherently a bad thing for stimulating the economy, but for savers and long-term investors, it poses a risk. Bitcoin offers a hedge against this constant expansion by presenting an alternative that cannot be inflated away. Its scarcity and decentralized control make it an ideal asset for those looking to preserve their wealth over the long term. As Bitcoin adoption grows, its utility and value increase, making it an expanding system that rewards participants rather than a zero-sum game. 

Bitcoin is simple. The technology doesn’t need to evolve. It is sufficient to simply serve as a store of value. Fiscal policy will play out, and we will inevitably see fiat flow from the printers to the blockchain. So, grab yourself some corn. Be patient. We’ll continue to be surprised where this thing goes.

Been patiently waiting and buying for 4 years since 2020. 

Finally we are supposed to be entering the phase where good news take the price upwards and bad news are somewhat ignored.

Quantitative easing and dovish fed approach, presidential candidate saying he will add Bitcoin to US strategic reserves, countries mining Bitcoin, money printing, faith in dollar declining. Still the price is doing nothing for 8 months, even doing lower highs.

But when Iran launches an attack, a bad CPI print, one government sells or has permission to sell, we instantly erase what took us weeks to recover.

When S&P 500 dumps, we dump accordingly, but when it pumps, we are left behind.

October is where previous cycles started to climb, yet here we are unable to pass 64k.

Hashrate is at ATH, ETFs been buying like crazy, all bitcoiners I know are HODLING. What I am missing?

I know elections puts uncertainty, but we are being so easily manipulated to the downside that it's quite frustrating.

Everyone is screaming ""we are about to"", ""are you ready?"", ""Soon"", ""last time we go under"".

How crazy I am to expect the ""Soon"" finally arrives?

I won't sell, I've been waiting for 4 years and willing to wait more, but anyone else is having this same frustration?

It's so obvious Bitcoin is the solution to our broken monetary system, yet the price doesn't reflect that. I don't even mind the US dollar parity, I'm talking about straight purchasing power, which today is around 55k in 2021 dollars.

Reddit,bitcoin,Time in the market is better than timing the market ,2024-10-10 16:20:56,"I see videos of Plan B talking about how the best returns would have come from buying 6 months before the halving, selling 18 months after the halving, and then repeating that over and over again.

He claims doing this leads to far greater returns than just holding.

Here is why he is wrong and why holding is the superior strategy.

1) He doesnt take into account capital gains tax consequences from selling. When you sell you lose around 20% to 30% of all your gains on average depending on what country you live in.

2) Very smart investors have said after you take profits it becomes psychologically very hard to reinvest those profits back in again. No one wants to let go of profits they have locked in. This means most people would not be able to reinvest all the proceeds from selling their bitcoin, at best they might put half back in.

3) What happens when hyperbitcoinization and the bitcoin super cycle kicks in and there is no retracement? You would have sold what you thought was the top, but it kept on rising and you wont be able to make yourself buy back in at a higher price until its obvious the price is never going back down to where you sold, so to rebuy would mean getting half the bitcoin you once had.

For all these reasons combined simply holding is far more profitable than selling 18 months after the halving and rebuying again 6 months before the halving.

TLDR; at the end of the day you will have far more bitcoin if you just hold through all the volatility instead of trying to buy and sell based on the halving.

In fact, inflation has remained relatively low.

Japan also doesn't have any of the social problems were are told stem from high debt and money printing. This thread is good and highlights differences between USA & Japan:

[https://x.com/NathanLands/status/1844754874107584518](https://x.com/NathanLands/status/1844754874107584518)

Given that many advocate for Bitcoin as a protection against inflation caused by excessive money printing and debt and that Bitcoin fixes many social problems that stem from that, how do we reconcile Japan's situation? 

Should we still view Bitcoin as a reliable hedge against inflation when examples like Japan seem to defy traditional economic expectations?

It would have been as expensive as buying / sending ether but it takes 150 times longer. Outrageous.

This hit me hard, as with crypto you can send it all over the world with very little overhead, so I thought, what would it take for businesses to accept crypto ?

The only bottleneck I could think of would be the CEX's, as it happens often that they freeze accounts on a whim etc. But if the CEX is just used as a transition platform, this effect would be pretty mitigated, right ?

So, what would be the hold-back for a business to put that in place ? As far as I understand, there shouldn't be any regulatory issues since it would be the same as buying/selling merchandise trough Tradfi, but there would just be the CEX middleman.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Among these, RWA appears to hold the most potential, as tokenization is one of the core uses of blockchain technology, originally designed to solve the double-spending problem and enable the online transfer and trading of value.

Currently, the total TVL (Total Value Locked) of [RWA crypto projects](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/RWA) stands at approximately $6 billion, up from just $140 million in 2022. However, the market performance of RWA tokens has not matched that of Bitcoin.

Also, Hesabpay may have started in Afghanistan, but current geopolitics makes me think it will spread, especially with its partnership with the  World Food Programme. 
There is so much in Algorands ecosystem that sets it apart.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Token-Based DeFi on UTXO Chains,2024-10-11 19:54:58,"In addition to enabling the token use-cases you’re most likely familiar with (like NFT art and Initial Coin Offerings), protocol level tokens can enable decentralized applications rivaling the capabilities of blockchains like Ethereum, but on the more scalable UTXO architecture.

(UTXO chains only have to keep track of which coins haven’t been spent yet, while EVM chains need to keep track of an entire virtual computer, with various programs running simultaneously and potentially interacting with one another.)

While UTXO chains like Bitcoin may not be the first ones you think of when you hear terms like “smart contract” and “decentralized finance”, it’s important to remember that the Bitcoin network launched with its own “scripting language”. Using a predefined set of functions (called opcodes), users could make customized rules for what will make a transaction valid or invalid.

(That's actually how every normal Bitcoin address works: it's just a set of rules requiring a signature from the same private key that was used to generate the address.)

With that foundation to build on, only several upgrades are necessary to bring UTXO chains up to speed with EVM.

The first is to enable ""Oracles"". Oracles allow smart contracts to use trusted sources of information from outside the blockchain. That data could include current exchange rates for futures contracts, or the status of a delivery for escrow contracts. This can be done with just a few new opcodes.

The second necessary upgrade is “transaction introspection”. Introspection opcodes allow smart contracts to restrict not just whether coins can be sent, but also how those coins can be sent. For example, you might keep your savings in a smart-contract that doesn’t let you withdraw more than 5% of the balance per day, unless your financial advisor co-signs the transaction.

These two upgrades enable a surprising number of financial products and features on their own, but there are still applications that would be impractical or impossible to implement without the third and final upgrade: protocol level tokens.

With the addition of miner-validated tokens, a UTXO chain can host much more complex financial products like decentralized exchanges (or DEXs), decentralized autonomous organizations (or DAOs), and even side-chain prediction markets, all without sacrificing its excellent scaling characteristics.

The details are a little technical, but I’ll try to give you a general idea of how it works.

Transactions on UTXO chains are executed “atomically”, that is, independently from all other transactions, past and present. This is in contrast with EVM chains, which have access to the chain's ""global state"". (Transactions can look at each other, and the history of the chain.) Global state makes it easy to build complex applications, but it doesn't scale very well.

Without access to global state, we need another way to represent and keep track of the various data structures used by complex smart contract applications. That’s where tokens come in.

While you might usually think of tokens as representing “assets”, you can generalize the concept and think of them instead as little messages that can be passed around between smart contracts. Each token just needs a small commitment of data, and a category. The category allows the token to prove independently that it was issued by a given contract, and the data defines how the token interacts with the contract.

By cleverly arranging and interconnecting multiple contracts that can issue and redeem tokens, we can create DEXs and DAOs whose current “state” is represented entirely by the balances of those contracts, the locations of their issued tokens, and those tokens’ properties.

But in this case, interacting with a Defi application doesn’t require knowing about all the other tokens it issued. Your tokens carry the unforge-able data on how you can interact with the application, and that’s all you need. Instead of tracking state “globally”, token-based DeFi tracks state “locally”. 

As a final note, it’s important to understand that you will NOT be able to copy and paste smart contracts from Ethereum to UTXO chains, like you could from Ethereum to other EVM chains. While you may be able to build similar applications, the design process is completely different.

Think of it like how both a carpenter and 3D printer can make a birdhouse, but giving a carpenter a list of coordinates, extrusion rates, and some plastic filament will get you about as far as leaving a 3D printer alone in a woodshop overnight.

While designing smart contracts from this token-centric perspective may be less intuitive than working with EVM, the scaling bewnefits can not be overstated.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Without much they can do in terms of action against Polymarket they've decided the next step is to try and Nuke Polymarkets online reputation.

To that end they've taken to TrustPilot to sabotage the rating for the company.

https://preview.redd.it/wikw4fouittd1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=f66edd06807beb47cec117b8d71d409be11f0452

# What Happened?

Polymarket hosted a Market with the title: Will Israel invade Lebanon in September? Well on the night of September 30th (US Time) Israel decided to invade Lebanon for a series of ""operations"" to push Hezbollah away from the border.

https://preview.redd.it/a26nmnd1kttd1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f87c0da486804c8448836a96359357b2a3fed76

Although the exact wording of ""Invasion"" was widespread across news outlets, **this market would ultimately resolve to no.**

# Wait, what it resolved to no? Why?

The reason it resolved no is probably up for dispute but it likely is a result of the market not ""technically"" meeting the created ""Rules"".

https://preview.redd.it/70qn49dkkttd1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c76ce668361c977b91c2dd1bb31cccc24273ad

Although the market certainly met the title requirements for ""yes"". No bettors argued that although Israel sent soldiers into Lebanon they didn't announce that they wanted to take control of any part of ""Lebanon"". So the market ""should result in No"".

# The Dispute and UMA:

UMA calls itself a 'Decentralized Truth Machine', among the many things UMA does for Polymarket one of their most notorious functions is handling Polymarket disputes. The simplified version of how it works is:

1. A dispute occurs.
2. Users make arguments on the UMA discord for why they think the market should resolve a certain way.
3. UMA Token Holders stake their tokens and vote on what the outcome of the dispute should be.
4. Some time later votes are revealed and the resolution most in favor is the Disputed Resolution.

Ignoring all obvious problems with this system like: UMA Holders being incentivized to vote for the outcome that financially favors them, and large UMA Holders being able to trade the market knowing how it will likely resolve.

The biggest and most glaring flaw in the system is the centralization of UMA tokenholders. In fact just two people at UMA control enough of the stake to lock down any dispute (if they are in agreement). **Of course this sounds like a glaring red flag so these two holders have as a result divided their tokens between a number of wallets to make voting ""appear more decentralized"".**

# The Israel/Lebanon Dispute.

In the Israel Lebanon Dispute although a majority of unique voters thought that the market should result to \[YES\].  The two UMA whales and a number of other smaller voters thought the market should result to \[NO\].

As a result the market: 'Will Israel invade Lebanon in September?' ended in \[NO\] and all \[YES\] Voters ended up losing their ""sure bet"".

The biggest individual loser was someone new to Polymarket who poured \~$420K onto the platform thinking the bet was all but guaranteed.

# The Aftermath

Beyond the immediate reaction of bettors nuking the Polymarket TrustPilot score. Losing bettors from the market are claiming that the Polymarket CEO committed a crime and deserves to be prosecuted.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Celsius lawyers are raking it in at the expense of their creditors: they are going after contractors,2024-10-09 18:03:12,"This is probably a shot in the dark.

It has been known that Celsius is pursuing users that happened to withdraw months prior to collapse, in several lawsuits that have no chance of recovering more than the cost of the legal representation of their customers.

I will provide a little more to this story. I used to work for Celsius as a contractor, a SWE. I have been slapped with a lawsuit that is laughable. They are literally full of shit, claiming that me, as a contractor, aided in the catastrophic deployment of capital that led to its demise. That my salary was unjust enrichment because I provided nothing of value back to Celsius 's creditors. I caught wind that they are also going after other entities like Uniswap for enabling pools that allowed to lose money.

Like if I ever had any kind of access to the private keys that these dumbfucks loaded in their Metamask wallets to participate in the Stakehound fiasco, the participation in liquidity mining ponzis, purchase of shitty NFT art at Opensea, or buy CEL to pump the price.

Let me tell you one thing, if by any chance you are a Celsius lawyer: good luck reaching out to this jurisdiction. I might be banned from USA for life, but you are not recovering one penny from the below-average salary I was earning. I invoiced everything and paid my income tax, and I have all the source code of the projects that I owned, along with their conversations surrounding the development.

If you are a Celsius creditor, you should know what they are doing with what is left of your money: legal theft. There is not a chance in hell that the amount of fees they are earning is going to be less than a sad contractor salary. Just 1 hour of their time is more than 30 times mine. They are screwing you and you should stop them from taking from the little that was left in this disaster.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Reddit,crypto,Secure and Private Encrypted P2P Chat in Javascript,2024-09-22 09:03:15,"im working on a decentralized p2p chat app where it handles all the important cryptographic functions in browser-based javascript. 

the crypto functionality can be seen [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/.github/blob/main/cryptography/Cryptography.js) (it is used as a micro frontend and loaded into the main app at runtime). the main chat app is open source for transparency [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat).

i think the approach on security in this app is unique and i would like to know which vulnerabilities i haven't considered. i try to answer all concerns in [this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityAdvice/comments/1ev5kqn/is_this_a_secure_messaging_app/).

i think if i stick to the principle of avoiding using any kind of ""required"" service provider (myself included) and allowing the frontend and the peerjs-server to be hosted independently, im on track for creating a chat system with the ""fewest moving parts"". im hope you will agree this is true p2p and i hope i can use this as a step towards unparalleled privacy and security.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Thank you for your time, and happy Meshing!",2024-10-13 00:55:05.660781

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.
