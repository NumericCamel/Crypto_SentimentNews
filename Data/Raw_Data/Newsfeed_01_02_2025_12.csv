Here are the detailed insights from each of the key areas Qureshi covered: Crypto Predictions 2025 By Haseeb Qureshi #1 A Blurring Line Between L1s/L2s: In his crypto predictions 2025, Qureshi forecasts the diminishing distinctions between Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, forecasting a major consolidation within the blockchain industry. “The era of differentiating L1s from L2s based on technical capabilities is over. It’s now about carving out niches and enhancing user stickiness,” he declares. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Capitalizes On Elon Musk’s X Name Change For 17,000% Return This shift implies a future where strategic market positioning and user experience outweigh pure technological innovation. “EVM will not only retain its dominance but expand, driven by platforms like Base, Monad, and Berachain,” he further asserts. Qureshi credits this growth to the vast repositories of Solidity training data, which will empower language models to write advanced application code in 2025, marking a significant transition towards AI-driven development within blockchain ecosystems. #2 Better Token Launches: Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 also foresee a revolution in token distribution mechanisms. He sees the industry moving away from large-scale airdrops, which often prioritize quantity over quality of engagement. “We’ll see a more strategic approach, where token distribution is aligned with long-term user engagement and project viability,” he notes. For projects with clear metrics and defined goals, tokens will be used as tools to enhance user retention and incentivize meaningful interactions. Meanwhile, projects lacking concrete metrics will likely pivot towards structured crowdsales to build and maintain a dedicated user base. Furthermore, he predicts that “memecoins will continue to lose market share to AI agent coins. I consider this a migration from financial nihilism to financial over-optimism. (Yep I’m coining that.).” #3 Accelerated Stablecoin Adoption: Stablecoins are set to become a cornerstone of business transactions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) seeking reliable and instant financial settlements. “We’re on the brink of seeing SMBs broadly adopt stablecoins, driven not just by their efficiency but by increasing institutional trust and involvement,” Qureshi noted. He anticipates significant movements from banks, including new stablecoin launches as financial institutions seek to capture part of this burgeoning market. Moreover, he remarks, “With Howard Lutnick as Secretary of Commerce, institutional hesitance will decrease, securing Tether’s top position amidst growing competition.” He adds, “Expect Ethena to gobble up even more capital, especially as treasury yields continue to decline over the coming year. When the opportunity cost of capital declines, it makes basis trade yields even more attractive.” #4 A Cautious Regulatory Advance: The regulatory outlook within Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 suggests a mixed bag of advancements and setbacks. According to him, 2025 will witness evolving regulations, with specific legislation around stablecoins likely to pass in the US. Related Reading: Top Crypto Assets For Q1 2025: Grayscale Reveals The Best Altcoins However, comprehensive market reforms such as the Financial Innovation Technology of the 21st Century Act (FIT21) might face delays. “While we see the regulatory framework for stablecoins strengthening, broader financial technology reforms will lag, creating a piecemeal regulatory environment,” he predicts. Additionally, Qureshi foresees that Fortune 100 companies will become more willing to offer crypto to consumers under the Trump administration. “Trump’s inauguration will create a perceived regulatory jubilee until clear rules and enforcement priorities are set. During this window, expect to see aggressive expansion of crypto integration into Web2 platforms,” he remarks. #5 AI Agents Will Evolve Beyond The Hype: A significant portion of Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 involves the role of AI agents in reshaping the crypto landscape. He criticizes the current state of AI agents, suggesting, “Today’s AI agents are essentially sophisticated chatbots linked to cryptocurrencies. They lack true agency and are primarily designed for interactions rather than autonomous operation.” Despite these limitations, he believes the role of AI in crypto will grow significantly, moving from novelty to necessity. “AI’s capability to automate and enhance blockchain operations will lead to a software development renaissance, drastically lowering the barriers to entry for blockchain applications,” he forecasts. #6 Crypto x AI: Looking beyond 2025, Qureshi envisions a deeper integration between crypto and AI technologies. “As we refine AI capabilities and regulatory frameworks, crypto will increasingly facilitate AI operations, leading to autonomous agents conducting transactions and managing their own economies on blockchain networks,” he stated. This interplay is expected to revolutionize user experiences and operational efficiencies, paving the way for a new era of decentralized and autonomous digital ecosystems.

This bounce not only reaffirms the significance of this zone but also sparks fresh hopes for a potential bullish breakout. With momentum building, the bulls appear to be gearing up for a rally, aiming to push SHIB toward higher resistance levels and beyond. The market sentiment surrounding SHIB has shifted positively, with speculation on the likelihood of a breakout above its next resistance levels. Technical indicators suggest growing bullish momentum, but the road ahead is challenging. Overcoming the immediate resistance will require sustained buying pressure and robust market participation. Key Support Holds Strong: The Importance Of $0.00002045 The $0.00002045 level has emerged as a cornerstone for Shiba Inu’s price trajectory, acting as a critical support zone in the current market structure. This level has consistently demonstrated its significance, providing a base for rebounds and serving as a key psychological level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu 260% Rally: Analyst Sees Classic Bullish Patterns Emerging Support levels like $0.00002045 are more than price markers; they represent zones where buying interest is strong enough to counter selling pressure, preventing further declines. For SHIB, this level has become a battleground, where bulls step in to defend against bearish momentum. Its recent successful rebound from this support highlights its importance, instilling confidence in market participants and signaling the potential for more gains. Furthermore, the $0.00002045 support aligns with broader market trends and key technical indicators, such as oversold signals on RSI or strong trading volume, reinforcing its role as a pivotal zone. As Shiba Inu navigates its path forward, this support level will continue to be a critical marker in determining whether the bulls can maintain control or if bears will gain the upper hand. Shiba Inu’s Next Move: Will The Bulls Maintain Control? Currently, SHIB is attempting to cross above the Simple Moving Average (SMA). A decisive move above this indicator could solidify the bullish narrative. Interestingly, this could open the door for further growth and increased market confidence, sparking a move toward the $0.00002631 resistance level. Key technical indicators, such as the RSI and trading volume, suggest rising interest. However, the bulls must capitalize on this momentum to avoid a possible reversal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead? SHIB has surged to the $0.0000224 level after witnessing a rebound. Should the bulls falter, SHIB could face renewed bearish pressure, pulling the price back toward the critical $0.00002045 support level. This level will remain a focal point as reaching it could either reinvigorate bullish sentiment or act as a trigger for a deeper correction. Ultimately, SHIB’s next move will depend on how the bulls navigate this critical phase. Will they maintain control and drive the price toward fresh highs, or will the bears regain dominance? The coming days promise to be decisive for SHIB’s short-term trajectory. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

As more interest is gathered, SHIB is building up the momentum needed for overcoming critical resistance levels. Breaking Resistance Levels Even though the prediction is for price growth, SHIB needs to break through a key resistance level at $0.000029. Analysts say that breaking above this level is the first thing that needs to happen for the token to reach its lofty goal of $0.000080. In the past, this resistance had stopped SHIB in its tracks, but recent good sentiment might be enough now. Meanwhile, the metrics from Coincheckup have shown an improved trading volume and market sentiment of SHIB. If this continues, the token might find the strength to overcome the current barriers it faces. The Broader Crypto Context The surge for Shiba Inu is happening in the midst of more significant changes in the cryptocurrency space. The recent stabilization of Ethereum and Bitcoin has created an opportunity for altcoins like SHIB to flourish. Furthermore, new players have entered the market as a result of memecoins’ growing appeal as speculative investments. According to other analysts, the optimism may also stem from SHIB’s long-term strategy, which centers on Shibarium, their Layer 2 blockchain. Investors find SHIB’s use case more appealing since Shibarium enables quicker transactions and cheaper costs. Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,XRP’s Path To $15: A Look At Historical Price Alignments,2025-01-01 13:00:58+00:00,"In a technical analysis shared by crypto analyst Bobby A (@Bobby_1111888) on X, the analyst projects that XRP will potentially reach the $15 mark in this bull run, contingent upon historical price movement patterns aligning. The analysis delves into XRP’s past market cycles, applying percentage-based extrapolations and chart pattern assessments to forecast future price trajectories. Is A XRP Price Of $15 Realistic? Bobby A’s analysis juxtaposes XRP’s performance during its 2017 market cycle against its current 2024 trajectory. From the range-high breakout in 2017, marked by a horizontal black dashed line on the chart, XRP experienced an initial appreciation of 629%. In comparison, the asset has appreciated approximately 331% since its range-high breakout in 2024. Extending further back, from the December 2014 high to the May 2017 peak—approaching the 4.236 Fibonacci extension—XRP saw a staggering 1,330% increase. Related Reading: XRP Nears Oversold Territory: Will $1.9 Support Trigger A Rebound? Applying the principle of reducing percentage point increases by half, as observed from the initial surge in 2017, Bobby A posits that XRP’s next impulse could result in a 665% increase. This calculation positions XRP at an approximate $15.00 near the 4.236 Fibonacci extension level. “XRP appears to be cutting its percentage point increases in half compared to its 2017 market cycle. If XRP cuts its next impulse in half from a percentage point increase perspective, as it did with this first one, it would put the asset’s price at roughly ~$15.00 near its 4.236 extension after a possible 665% increase,” Bobby A elaborates. Notably, the analyst also notices a developing bull flag pattern, a continuation pattern that typically signals the potential for further upward movement. This bull flag is targeting the upper boundary of XRP’s macro parallel channel, estimated around the $10.50 price level. “The current bull flag the asset is forming targets the top of its macro parallel channel near $10.50,” Bobby A notes. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Descending Triangle On The Daily Chart, Why $1.95 Is Important Another analyst, bassii (@cryptobassii), responded with a contrasting viewpoint centered on fractal analysis. Bassii posits that the ongoing run may be curtailed by 42%, projecting XRP’s price to approach $9, followed by a significant downturn. He elaborates on the fractal patterns, stating, “This run seems to be cut to 42%, would get us close to $9, then a big drop. But you’re missing the last part of the 2017 run, IF (big if) that happens, and we keep same %, we get around $30 after months of accumulation.” Or Even $35? Bassii referred to a previous analysis of himself where he emphasized the similarities between the 2024 run and the 2017 cycle. Notably, both periods exhibit five weeks of consecutive green candles, albeit with differing magnitudes—approximately 500% in 2024 compared to 1,200% in 2017. He points out, “2017: 5 weeks of green candles at ~1,200% ^, followed by 3 weeks of red candles down 63%. 2024: Also, 5 weeks of green candles at ~500% up (~1/2 of 2017’s run), followed by… (so far) 1 week of red candles by how much? You guessed it… 30% down.” The subsequent correction phases also mirror each other, with XRP experiencing a 30% decline in 2024 compared to a 63% drop in 2017, each roughly halved in magnitude. Based on this, Bassii outlines potential future movements based on historical patterns, suggesting that if XRP continues to follow these fractal patterns without significant breakdowns, it could accumulate over several months and potentially ascend to $30 by September 2025. Responding to Bassii’s analysis, Bobby A expresses cautious optimism, stating, “Yeah but I’m not sure that the last impulse will come. The next one I’m much more confident in.” Bassii complements this by highlighting the importance of adhering to fractal patterns and real-time chart developments, adding, “I think it will depend on how closely we follow the fractals and what the chart tells us during this upcoming run. So far it’s followed very very closely. The weekly candles for the last 8 weeks have followed beat by beat. I’m not a moon boy, I know how crazy $30-35 sounds. But if we’re still tracking the 2017 run.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.1581. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,2025 Bitcoin Predictions: Top Fund Manager Shares His Outlook,2025-01-01 10:15:06+00:00,"In a thread on X, Alistair Milne, the co-founder and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of the Altana Digital Currency Fund (ADCF), has outlined his Bitcoin predictions for 2025. With a tenure at ADCF dating back to 2014, Milne’s insights carry significant weight in the investment community. Bitcoin Predictions For 2025 Milne began his forecast by addressing the potential involvement of the United States in Bitcoin accumulation. “Some of my 2025 Bitcoin predictions: The big one: Trump won’t announce Bitcoin buying on behalf of the USA in 2025, but he WILL sign an order preventing any seized BTC from being sold … creating a defacto reserve. It will still create global FOMO,” Milne stated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch? Thus, Milne predicts that Trump will not follow US Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act which proposes to buy 1 million BTC over five years. However, Milne thinks that the US under President-elect Trump will keep its 198,109 BTC (according to Arkham data) as national stockpile as promised by Trump during the last Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, potentially sparking fear of missing out (FOMO) globally. Expanding on the international landscape, Milne predicts increased adoption by smaller and more agile nations. “Other, smaller and more nimble nations (in addition to Bhutan and El Salvador) will announce Bitcoin Reserves and start buying or mining before the USA does. Middle Eastern countries will start announcing their holdings,” he noted. Corporate engagement with Bitcoin is also expected to rise. Milne forecasts that at least one other S&P 500 company, meaning not Tesla or MicroStrategy will announce a Bitcoin acquisition in 2025. Related Reading: Warning Signs For Bitcoin? Binance Trading Volume Drops As Sellers Take Control Price projections remain bullish in Milne’s Bitcoin predictions. He anticipates, “Bitcoin should get to around $200-250k, even without the US gov buying. If the US does start buying, expect closer to $500k. Yes, in 2025. This is because it officially becomes a nation state arms race and there isn’t enough Bitcoin.” Milne also addresses market dynamics, predicting that Bitcoin will peak in the second half of the year. While his tip is October, he posits that the bear market will be “significantly milder than the previous ones given nation states and corporations will slowly accumulate.” Addressing concerns related to security and market stability, Milne mentions, “Bitfinex is finally sent back the majority of its hacked BTC … causing a temporary dip in the market as people FUD and say they will dump the Bitcoin (they won’t, they’ll slowly convert 80% of it to LEO over 18 months).” The collapse and subsequent recovery of major exchanges also play a role in Milne’s Bitcoin predictions for 2025. He states, “FTX begins distributing the USD to creditors in Q1, via several large exchanges … making it easy for them to re-invest in Bitcoin, etc.. At least 50% of the money returned will be reinvested.” This influx of reinvested funds is expected to inject liquidity back into the Bitcoin market, fostering a renewed price rally. Milne doesn’t overlook the performance of institutional investors, noting, “MSTR achieves a ‘Bitcoin yield’ of ~30% in 2025 before the premium closes.” Lastly, Milne concludes his Bitcoin predictions with a note to Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. On the campaign trail, incoming US president Donald Trump vowed to free Ulbricht. He forecasts that Trump will follow his words: “Ross will be freed.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,070.

Related Reading: Altcoins To Explode In Early 2025: Analyst Says “Grand Finale” Is Around The Corner Bitcoin Sees End-On-Year Slowdown Bitcoin has struggled to hold the mid-zone of its one-month price range as the crypto market experiences an end-of-year slowdown. In December, BTC surpassed the $100,000 barrier for the first time, reaching a new all-time high of $108,353 mid-month. Over the last 30 days, the flagship crypto has moved between $90,000 and $108,000, hovering between $96,000 and $102,000 for most of the month. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has registered a 10.5% decline since hitting its ATH, failing to hold the $98,000 level over the last two weeks. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw a brief recovery on December 25 but quickly lost its Christmas rally gains. Since then, BTC’s price recorded its deepest retrace since the start of December. Bitcoin fell below the crucial $92,000 support zone on Monday, dipping to $91,530 before recovering, raising concern about BTC’s monthly close. However, New Year’s Eve started with a 4.2% surge throughout the morning, fueling end-of-year optimism about a price rebound. The cryptocurrency’s price moved from $92,000 to $96,000 before retracing to the $95,000 support zone. As the BTC’s price climbed, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential showed a buy signal on the 12-hour chart, potentially signaling a New Year’s Day price bounce. ‘All Is Well’ For BTC’s Rally Martinez suggested that “a sustained close above $94,700 could lead to a rebound to $97,500.” As the analyst previously pointed out, this level is one of BTC’s most significant support zones, and reclaiming it is key for the cryptocurrency’s short-term rally. On the contrary, “losing $92,500 as support will invalidate the bullish signal,” Martinez added. Losing this level could also send BTC to the $70,000 level based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart. The analyst has stated that a 25% crash to the $70,000 mark is possible, as the URPD chart shows minimal support below the key support wall. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Large Consolidation Trend Points To Possible Price Explosion To $8,000 Meanwhile, James Van Straten noted that “all is well” despite BTC’s current price action. The analyst highlighted that “this cycle as with the previous three cycles for BTC, all saw corrections at this point after the halving,” adding that the “corrections are starting later and finishing later. Maybe, to do with elongated cycles.” As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,949, a 1% increase in the daily timeframe.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Warning Signs For Bitcoin? Binance Trading Volume Drops As Sellers Take Control,2025-01-01 02:00:22+00:00,"Amid Bitcoin continuous correction in recent weeks, there has been a significant drop in BTC’s trading volume on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange raising concerns about the implications for the market. A CryptoQuant analyst has highlighted in a report that both spot and futures trading volumes for the BTC/USDT pair have witnessed a sharp decline. This reduction in activity suggests weakened buying power and decreased liquidity, two critical elements in maintaining price stability in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Now Worst Since Mid-October: Reversal Signal? Trading Activity on Binance Signals Caution for Bitcoin Traders The analyst known as Crazzyblockk disclosed that the drop in trading volume is particularly important as centralized exchanges like Binance play a pivotal role in balancing supply and demand dynamics. A decline in trading activity typically indicates reduced demand, leaving the market more vulnerable to price swings. With fewer active buyers, any significant sell-off could trigger rapid price declines, amplifying volatility across the broader Bitcoin market. Crazzyblockk urges caution, advising traders to avoid impulsive decisions. The analyst wrote: Given the current market conditions, it is advisable to exercise extra caution and avoid making impulsive decisions. Even small shifts in buying or selling pressure could lead to significant volatility in the Bitcoin market. Adding to this concern is the observation that Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio has tilted toward sellers. This metric, which measures whether aggressive buyers (takers) are purchasing or selling more actively, suggests that sellers currently dominate market activity. Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Hints at Market Sentiment Shift The taker buy-sell ratio is an essential indicator for understanding market sentiment, especially on Binance, which handles a significant portion of global Bitcoin trading. Crazzyblockk has reported a noticeable shift in this ratio over recent weeks, with sellers becoming increasingly dominant. When sellers aggressively fill more orders than buyers, it signals bearish sentiment and raises the likelihood of continued downward price movement. This shift follows weeks of weak buyer activity, suggesting that bullish momentum has stalled. However, it remains unclear whether this pattern will persist or reverse in the coming days. Crazzyblockk noted: If this trend persists and the inclination remains toward sell contracts, a deeper market correction could be anticipated. However, a resurgence in buyer activity might stabilize prices and restore confidence among market participants.  Despite these concerns, it is worth noting that the current situation can be seen as a potential buying opportunity, especially for long-term investors.

Historical patterns suggest that periods of low trading volume and bearish sentiment often precede major market rebounds. However, it is still advised to remain cautious and avoid speculative trading strategies in the current market environment.

Report Predicts $8,000 ETH Price",2025-01-01 00:30:43+00:00,"According to a recent report by Steno Research, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025. This outlook is attributed to historical trends and the anticipated impact of favorable cryptocurrency regulations following Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s victory in the November election. Will 2025 Be The Year Of Ethereum? While the overall cryptocurrency market surged to unprecedented heights this year – reaching an all-time high (ATH) total market cap of $3.9 trillion – Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has lagged behind in terms of price performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Rejected At $4,000 Resistance Again: What Lies Ahead For ETH? However, Steno Research’s report suggests Ethereum could finally achieve a new ATH in 2025, driven by increased institutional investment and supportive regulatory developments. The report predicts that ETH could climb to at least $8,000 in the upcoming year. Bitcoin is also expected to hit a new ATH of $150,000 in 2025, but Ethereum may more than double from its current price of $3,400. Additionally, the ETH/BTC trading pair is forecasted to rise from 0.035 to 0.06 within the next 12 months. The weekly chart below illustrates ETH’s declining performance against BTC since September 2022. However, the pair is now hovering near a crucial support level at 0.035, with expectations of a rebound to the 0.06 level, which was last seen in February 2024. Steno Research’s optimistic forecast for Ethereum underscores a potential bullish momentum for altcoins in 2025. Mads Eberhardt, an analyst at Steno Research, stated: This expectation is partly based on the argument that Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory is more favorable for altcoins than for Bitcoin. The report adds that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) – a metric used to gauge the proportion of the total crypto market cap commanded by BTC – is expected to tumble to as low as 45% from its current level.  The following weekly chart demonstrates BTC.D’s sustained uptrend since September 2022, rising from a low of around 39% to a peak of 61%. However, recent price action suggests a lower high has been formed, signaling a potential sharp decline to around 45%. DeFi Activity To Rebound In 2025 The report further predicts a resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity within Ethereum’s ecosystem in 2025. Specifically, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications is expected to hit a new high of $300 billion next year. Related Reading: DeFi Exploits Plunge 40% In 2024, But Centralized Exchange Losses Soar – Report Renewed interest in DeFi could further drive higher altcoin prices in 2025. Notably, ETH jumped 10% following Trump’s November election victory, as improved sentiment surrounding DeFi regulations boosted market confidence. In addition, strong inflows attracted by spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) further strengthen the bullish case for ETH heading into 2025. At press time, ETH trades at $3,417, up 3% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from Tradingview.com",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

If so, how?


To my understanding on pump the liquidity is locked when it's moved to raydium.
So how could someone rug my sol on pump or raydium?


Would it be better to slowly pump it over time? Won't that look shady pumping it from one wallet?",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Apate's Roman equivalent was Fraus, her male counterpart was Dolus, and her opposite was Aletheia, the goddess of truth.""

Found this entertaining AI Agent that spreads 
obvious and harmless misinformation through X. Very similar to r/nottheonion.

He responds to famous people's tweets like zerebro without the need to tag him.

Reddit,solana,(Unpopular opinion) Tax is a good thing and Pump.fun culture is severely lacking because it doesn't employ tax.,2025-01-02 06:36:47,"Yeah, may see some hatred for this but it's honestly the truth. Here's why having tax as an option is a good thing, and why pumpfun culture is lacking in terms of depth.

1) **Tax Culture Thrives:** teams with funds uplift snipers, connectors, consultants, coders, bot devs, mods, artists, web designers, raiders—in tax culture, anyone can make $60-80K/year as an entry-level Telegram moderator.

2) **Variety:** ETH has memecoins, tokenomics plays, LARPs, utilities, competition coins, treasury tokens, and more.  Pumpfun has memecoins. The reason? Tax.

3) **Innovation:** utility might not *need* tax, but it makes a huge difference. Without tax, developing utility means dumping your own supply, which isn’t sustainable.

4) **Transparency:** you’re already paying tax—it’s just through team sells. Tax allows teams to generate revenue transparently in very very small, spread-out increments. It brings accountability and a visible marketing wallet for holders.

5) **Strategy:** teams with money adds strategy, it replaces the luck of the SOL with competitive fields.  You want to make $300k/year?  Sure, anyone can do it in tax culture, you just need to put in the work. 

Thanks for reading my rant.",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

I'd like to do this for solana but am having trouble finding something similar to it. 

I'd like a place that allows you to sort by created date and one where you can buy new coins. Is this even a thing for SOL? Are there other ones for other coins like ETH?

Schizo Terminal: Redefining AI Infra  
  
Schizo Terminal: the most advanced, decentralized AI infra you’ll ever see. At $15M market cap, it’s ridiculously mispriced. [$SCHIZO](https://x.com/search?q=%24SCHIZO&src=cashtag_click) isn’t just a sleeper it’s the swarm’s signal, vibrating louder, ready to fracture the void.  


SCHIZO EDGE :  
  
✅Decentralized Infrastructure   
✅Image Interpretation   
✅Context Interpretation   
✅Relationship Building   
✅News Sentiment Analysis   
✅Video Generation   
✅TikTok Generation   
✅Self-Improvement (Coming Soon)  
✅Live Voice (Coming Soon)  
  
Schizo Terminal offers the most comprehensive feature set at just $25 MC, while competitors like Aixbt, Truth Terminal, Zerebro with higher valuations miss critical functionalities. A striking misvaluation.  
  
  
The current AI market is fractured between:  
  
1. Ai16z: Advanced agents but limited by technical barriers and a lack of user-friendly UI.  
2. Virtuals Protocol: Simplified creation but stuck with primitive agent capabilities (excluding rare exceptions requiring team coordination).  
  
[$SCHIZO](https://x.com/search?q=%24SCHIZO&src=cashtag_click) bridges this gap by offering a more evolved framework than Virtuals and Streamlined interface that bypasses the technical barriers of Ai16z.  
  
  
Schizo Terminal goes beyond standalone tools by building a fully integrated ecosystem, which includes:  
  
 Agent Constructor: Intuitive tools for creating advanced AI agents effortlessly.  
 Framework: Modular swarm capabilities, delivering unmatched scalability.  
 <Redacted>: A barrier-free platform designed for seamless user access without the need for technical expertise.  
 <Redacted>: A vibrant interaction backrooms where agents communicate, collaborate, and compete, offering tasks, challenges, and opportunities for both agents and their creators to excel.  
  
At current price, it’s ridiculously undervalued compared to competitors like Virtual ($3.5B), Ai16z ($1B), and ARC ($200M).  
  
  
The swarm is awakening. [$SCHIZ](https://x.com/search?q=%24SCHIZO&src=cashtag_click)O is the signal. Align, or be left behind.

I have a proposal for render and Solana 

Thousands of projects are being developed on Solana. 

And many of these are ai projects that need compute.

Render should collaborate with Solana developer’s to create an easy integration where all Solana developers have access to render’s network of gpu’s

And as solana’s biggest Ai/DePin project it would make sense to use render.

This way all Solana projects would be able to access render gpu’s with just a few clicks.

Reddit,solana,Launched a coin that is real and nobody bought (yet ? ) - My Story of SomaliSHILL,2025-01-02 03:46:59,"Well the title is self explanatory (wrong flair but might be worth tagging). I launched a coin actually do something good. Not a meme coin, a real coin that I am still hoping will bring real utility to a community. I launched a coin called SomaliSHILL which is essentially a coin that is preparing to help [somali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia) communities. I am a software engineer as a profession so I am already building applications that I hope to launch as part of the utility of this token to help bring confidence. Liquidity is locked, some tokens were kept strictly for marketing, community events, server costs etc.

But we launched earlier today with not as much marketing and it did very bad. Telegram was cooked to say the least but I had some very trustworthy people help me and clean it up. Now this post is not an advertisement to buy my coin. DO NOT buy it if you do not believe in it. But here is what I learned from a failed launch

1. **Setup your telegram correctly**
   1. correct bots here are some you should consider
      1. safeguard - admin automation
      2. Rose - for admin automation
      3. Cherry bot - for raids
   2. Have trusted people you can help with cleaning up your TG because it will get flooded with bots and terrible messages
2. **Do the marketing before you launch**. Build as much hype as possible, find trusted marketers in the space that will help you reach your goals.
3. Prepare to spend - the chances of your coin doing well will do with the amount of money you spend. Scared money don't make no money. You will have millions of people asking you let me send your token into a million places. Just be very careful who you trust. Got scammed a couple times my self already (luckily it wasn't too much) but you budget for ""shit"" hitting the fan

Double, triple, quadruple think twice you think you token will just moon out of know where. 99.999% it will not. I am still going to be working on my token and building utility around it because I believe in my project.

If you need help with launching feel free to reach out to me because I learned a lot. And the biggest one is DO NOT TRUST ANYONE.

Reddit,solana,The Real Reason I Quit BullX: Fees,2025-01-01 18:45:17,"Alright, let me be real with y’all. I didn’t hate BullX at first. It worked, the interface was fine, trades went through—no major complaints. But then I started noticing this sneaky little problem that kept piling up: **fees.**

At first, I didn’t even pay attention. I thought, “Oh, it’s just part of trading.” But when I finally sat down and added it all up? Bruh, I was losing **hundreds** a month. And it wasn’t even like I was trading with huge bags! Just regular trades, slowly bleeding me dry.

So, I started asking around, lurking on forums, and one name kept popping up: *Sniperoo.* I figured, why not? Opened [sniperoo.app](http://sniperoo.app), checked it out, and saw they had fees as low as **0.845%**. For context, BullX was hitting me with 1%+ almost every time.

Switched over, deposited some SOL (super easy), and started trading. And now? My profits actually feel like *my* profits. I’m not watching a chunk of every win disappear into the void.

Look, I’m not here to sell you on anything, but if you’re tired of paying ridiculous fees, maybe it’s time to rethink your setup. Sometimes, the “just deal with it” attitude is what keeps us stuck.

That’s my rant. Anyone else out there ditch BullX and feeling the same relief?

Reddit,solana,My Trading Experience: How I Finally Found the Right Tools for the Job,2024-12-31 19:38:19,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my trading journey and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. It’s been a bit of a ride, and I think some of you might relate.

For a while, I thought the key to trading was just about spotting the next big opportunity—like you can just jump in and make profits. But what I quickly realized was that **tools matter more than you’d think**.

When I started out, I didn’t realize how much the platform and fees were eating into my profits. I used to trade on a well-known exchange, but I noticed that no matter how well I did, I was always getting hit with those dreaded fees. At first, I didn’t care too much, but over time, those fees added up—especially when I started scaling up my trades. I was losing more to fees than I was making off my gains!

Then came the lag. I’d set up my trades and come back to see they hadn’t executed because of slow processing times. You know that feeling when you just missed a good opportunity? Yeah, I had a lot of those moments.

What really tipped me over the edge, though, was the hassle of managing multiple wallets. I was constantly switching between platforms, keeping track of balances, and manually checking each one. It was chaotic.

So, I decided to try something new. I stumbled across a platform called **Sniperoo** (shoutout to them), and I figured, why not give it a shot?

I’m honestly so glad I did. The first thing I noticed was how fast the trades were going through—under a second. No more lag, no more missed opportunities. Plus, the wallet management was so much smoother. I could keep track of all my trades in one place without constantly flipping between tabs.

And the best part? The fees are a fraction of what I was paying before. I’m saving so much more now, which means my profits actually feel like profits.

If you’re like I was—struggling with fees, lag, and managing everything manually—I really recommend checking out Sniperoo. It’s been a total game-changer for me.

And yeah, if you’re curious, using a referral code brings the fees down to **0.845%**—it’s a nice little bonus. Seriously, it's worth checking out if you’re looking to take your trading to the next level.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience. Hope it helps someone!",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Anyways what I wanted to say is that everytime or most of the times I create a coin and want to be the first one to buy my own coin, bots are front running it. I have so far only been buying my own coins trough the pump fun website itself and was wondering if there is any other way of buying my own coin without bots front running me.

Is it possible to create a coin on pumpfun without buying it immediately and then after creating it buy the coin using a bot (for example bullx) and set the slippage to 0%? Will that prevent front runners or are there better ways to do this? Thanks for the answers.",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

# [Announcing the Helius Startup Launchpad](https://www.helius.dev/blog/helius-startup-launchpad)

Helius' mission is to increase the economic potential of the world’s developers through crypto.

Today, we're launching the [Helius Startup Launchpad](https://www.helius.dev/startup-launchpad) to accelerate crypto's most ambitious startups.

Why? Many crypto founders excel at engineering but fall short across sales, fundraising, and business ops.

The Helius' developer platform helps you ship code, but the Helius Startup Launchpad helps you build a business.

We’re partnering with Solana’s top investors and operators to provide early-stage startups with the support they need to accelerate.

# What's the Problem?

Solana builders are highly technical but lack the experience needed to form an actual business. We've noticed that our customers are often talented engineers, but need help on sales, go-to-market, and even legal. A business requires a cross-functional effort across sales, hiring, fundraising, operations, legal, marketing, support, and engineering. And it must do this while relentlessly searching for PMF. This is no easy task, which is why founders must focus on it above all else. With Helius, we already give you all the technical tools you need to succeed, but that's not enough. With this launchpad, we will further help you with mentoring, support, and ecosystem integrations so that you get your time and money back to keep iterating on product.

# What We Offer

We’ve curated experts across every discipline and steep discounts to help you quickly launch your product on Helius and grow your company with confidence.

More specifically, this program provides:

* 8 months of free Business tier access
* Exclusive discounts from our partners
* Mentorship from veteran Solana operators
* Access to private working groups and education
* Warm intros to crypto's most influential investors

Our current investor and accelerator partners include Chapter One, Founders Fund, Foundation Capital, Haun Ventures, 6th Man Ventures, Propel, Solana Ventures, Colosseum, and the Solana Labs Accelerator.

We also have support from teams like Squads, Sphere, Ottersec, Moonpay, Artemis, Dynamic, and more.

# Who Should Apply

While every team is encouraged to apply, this program isn't for everyone.

This program is for founders who build for the long term.

We’re looking for teams that have some combination of the following:

* Have a working product
* Are a pre-seed or seed stage company (or earlier!)
* Graduated from other web3 accelerators
* Won or placed at recent Solana hackathons
* Are referred by well-known VCs or angel investors

If this sounds like you, [apply now](https://form.typeform.com/to/uShCvuLv).

# Become a Partner

If you’re an investor, angel, or startup-enabling company we want to help accelerate your portcos. We also want to work with companies offering essential products and services to early-stage crypto startups.

By joining the Helius Startup Launchpad as a partner, you:

* Get early access to Solana’s most promising young startups
* Shape the development of next-generation crypto applications
* Join an exclusive network of industry leaders and decision-makers

If you’re interested in working with Solana's best startups and providing exclusive discounts, co-working spaces, mentorship, intros, or training, [become a partner](https://form.typeform.com/to/murJcQm2).

# Ready to Build?

Never before in history has the builder had such leverage to move the world.

In crypto, with a few lines of code, you can:

* move millions of dollars around the Earth at the speed of light
* create unstoppable, global capital markets
* architect entire economies

All without permission.

The Internet enables the flow of information across the globe—crypto turns information into value and value into information.

The startup is now as powerful as the nation-state. Or at least, it has the potential to be. All startups can now contribute to the global economy and accelerate progress. But this is no easy task, for they must also fight against physics, incumbents, and time.

**If you're interested in this fight,** [**apply now**](https://form.typeform.com/to/uShCvuLv)**.**

an alert when 3 or 4 more users wallets that i follow, buys the same meme coin in a span of 5 minutes. 

if i add the trade, i like to set a take profit with alarm on it. also if i add a take profit on it , will that take profit be visible for everybody else on the trade platform? , incase people what to go stop loss hunting and kill the coin just before it hits take profit levels.

make a set file with trades beforehand and when a price hit a certain price point. the moment it hits ,give an alarm, i load a set file and it executes the trades on certain price levels right now, like a grid setup.

if this is not possible, could it then be possible that i create a bot that can do this and then add it on a trade platform? ",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,solana,Wrote my own Shitcoin Trading Bot in Python,2024-12-29 19:36:20,"Hey everyone, noticed another similar post, and wanted to post my efforts that I've been working on for the past 7 months. I'm not one to really shill anything, but wanted to put this out there as I know some people here might be interested in this. I've been working on an open-source premium trading bot project and already put out some free tutorials to help everyone get started on creating their own. These types of bots typically sell for ridiculous amounts, and I'm just looking to shake things up in this market as I really don't like the way some of these guys try to monopolize things.

A little bit about me:

Born and raised in the US. I've been in the software engineering field for over 20 years and have led small-mid size software teams throughout my career on successful projects. Now, I train software devs and make dev tutorials to benefit the community on the side. I took a real interest in crypto around 2022 when I saw a yahoo article on someone who made 20 mil on BOME lol. Naturally. I wanted to see what the hell was going on here, so I did my own DD and have been in the trenches ever since. Researching some of the best traders in the game, I realized a lot of what they were doing was very time consuming, but very necessary. With my Software background, I realized a lot of it could be automated, so I started working on building out this project with the intent on making passive income. I hit some roadblocks, as documentation and resources are lacking in this area and ChatGpt/Claude turned out to be not much help either. It took some time, but I eventually figured things out on my own, and thereafter, decided to share some of my developments with the community!

A few months ago, I started putting out free tutorials on how to create a basic bot from scratch in just a few days, and the feedback has been great so far, albeit my following is very low right now. Honestly, I started doing this all for fun really. Don't need handouts, and am financially stable. Not dropping any links, moderators are trigger happy on banning posts here. Hope the trenches treat you well today!",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Strangely, the address IS a SOL address. 4Vu4fzRtLGjH97uHkuN5Qa6rt8UFqvWBaAKqbLJovqZK - it's named ""System Program""

Why would I have a SOL address aside from my own in my clipboard? I've used my cut/past at least 8-10 times today, but have not sent any SOL aside from this withdrawal.

First, are these 4 SOL permanently lost? Second, any ideas HOW I would get that address in my clipboard from within Phantom Wallet? Or maybe I pasted the right address and Binance screwed up? Even if I've lost the SOL, I want to figure out how I did this.

Edit: I guess these SOL are gone. Still have no idea how I pasted an address I'd never heard of into the Binance website, I never knew it existed until today.

Edit: Thanks for the clipboard hijacking ideas. Will research that now. ",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

**zBTC: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Full Potential**  
  
At the heart of [@ApolloByZeus](https://x.com/ApolloByZeus) is zBTC, a permissionless Bitcoin asset that transforms Bitcoin into an interoperable tool for diverse yield opportunities.   
  
**Here’s why zBTC stands out:**  
  
**- Peg 1:1 with Native Bitcoin:** Maintains a secure 1:1 peg with Bitcoin through a trustless two-way peg system.  
  
**- Permissionless / No KYC:** Eliminates reliance on centralized entities, removes KYC barriers, and ensures uninterrupted access to assets with a permissionless experience.  
  
**- Sustainable on-chain Yield:** Unlocks on-chain yield opportunities in staking, lending, liquidity providing, and more within Solana’s DeFi ecosystem.  
  
**On December 30, 2024, APOLLO minted the first batch of zBTC, marking the start of trustless cross-chain.**

>**What’s Zeus Ecosystem?**  
  
Zeus Network drives cross-chain asset utility, starting with Bitcoin and expanding to Dogecoin ($DOGE), Litecoin ($LTC), and Kaspa ($KAS) by 2025, all on Solana.  
  
With APOLLO Mainnet now live, Bitcoin liquidity seamlessly integrates into Solana’s DeFi ecosystem.

Reddit,solana,Rock bottom. Need advice.,2024-12-28 11:01:06,"Hello. ELessar here. From Iran.
After quitting filmmaking cuz there was no money in it for me and gathering 2 months worth of money I Could gather 55$ and got into trading on phantom. After losing and losing I ended up with like 8 dollars. I found a community and I joinded them. We made a coin, we push it up to 4.7 mil ( my 8 dollar worthed 1100$ at some point ) but i didnt sell. Why? My fucking leaders said dont dump we will hit 100m. Little did I know that one by one they were dumping on us. And I didnt sell because alot of friends which I made in that community didnt sell either. I could not dump my money on them when they were being truthful. Little did we know that all of us are getting rugged slowly. being the ""good guy"" broke me. I was the last dumbass who sold for 4 dollars at the end. I could have started a business and bought some equipment for 1100$ dollars. But what did I do? Made myself broken than when I started this.
It's been 3 weeks since that incident. And here I am. 17dollars of solana and a few dust coins Im miserably sleeping on.
Give me some advice please. Psychologically, mentally, fkn physically. I dont know. My day and night is just me thinking about that 1100 dollars and that it could literally change my fkn life.
I love trading. Dont get me wrong, but I think I need some change of pace.
Appreciate anyone who is reading this.

Reddit,ethereum,Running ethereum node in Evernode,2025-01-02 05:50:54,"Hello,

I’m attempting to run an ethereum node on Evernode (evernode.org) by deploying the Docker version ethereum/ethereum:latest.

So far, I haven’t had any success. I suspect the issue might be related to the port configuration required for the node to communicate with the outside world. Do you have any tips or guidance?

You might be wondering why I chose Evernode for this. The idea of running a blockchain participation node on a platform powered by another blockchain (Evernode) is fascinating, and the pricing is incredibly low compared to other VPS options.

Thanks in advance!",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609
Reddit,ethereum,The Next Upgrade and Global Adoption 2025,2025-01-02 05:29:45,"##**Tech and upgrades coming in 2025**

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

Reddit,ethereum,EIP-7702 vs EIP-4337: What's the difference regarding Account Abstraction?,2025-01-02 05:31:30,"Hi!

Can someone explain the difference between EIP-7702 – *which will be included in the Pectra upgrade* – and EIP-4337 – *which has been deployed in 2023* – regarding Account Abstraction (AA)?

As far as I understand it, EIP-7702 will allow:  
\- gasless transactions / gas sponsoring: the user could pay in another token like USDC.

\- transactions budling

  
But I thought this was already possible with EIP-4337. What does EIP-7702 brings on the AA, compared to EIP-4337?

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,ethereum,Starting My Journey with Smart Contracts ,2024-12-29 21:07:13,"Hey everyone,

I’m just getting started with learning about smart contracts, and honestly, I’m pretty excited (and a little overwhelmed). Ethereum has always fascinated me, and I finally decided it’s time to stop just reading about it and actually start building something.

I’ve been messing around with Solidity and doing some tutorials to get a feel for how everything works. My goal is to eventually create my own project—something small and manageable for now, but hopefully useful or at least a good learning experience.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

I’m looking forward to learning from this community and (fingers crossed) sharing something cool soon!",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,ethereum,Those living in Canada: Do you save up in USDC?,2024-12-28 18:33:37,"Hi!

With the decline of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, are you considering creating your emergency fund in USD?
For sure, you can open an USD account in a traditional bank but do you also consider buying USDC (or other tokens)?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to have a discussion regarding **how relevant (or nor) is it to save up in USDC for a Canadian.** I know a lot of Canadians are already investing in USD anyway.
**Does saving up directly on a USD stablecoin make any sense?**


How I see it:

**Advantages**
- less fees (maybe not, I really don't know what are the fees for a USD account opened in Canada)
- easy to buy 

**Disadvantages**
- **taxes implications?** If you pay your transaction fees in ETH, technically you may have to pay taxes on it (depending on your ACB). Plus, since ERC-20 tokens are considered assets in Canada, you should pay taxes if you make a gain when you spend your USDC (*if USD(C)/CAD goes up in value across time, which is the current consensus*)
- **not easy to spend USD** outside of Crypto space (but crypto cards are democratizing)",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to run a state only node ?,2024-12-28 12:11:33,"Hey,

I'm not really sure how different Ethereum is from Bitcoin in client logic. From my understanding, there are transactions and state (smart contract values, etc...).

In my case, I need to access the read-only features of some smart contracts without spending too much on hardware. 

My current solution was to use an rpc provider, request the state of contract x, then listen for new blocks and update the state on my end based on the transactions received. This is necessary to avoid hitting rate limits, as my usage uses a large number of requests.

The problem is that the ""sync"" part can take days with the current rate limit because I'm using contract calls, which probably isn't the best solution. So I wanted to know if it was possible to run a node without the whole blockchain, just with the state, the goal is not to verify transactions but to know more efficiently the state of specific contracts.

Do you know if this is possible? if not, is it difficult to create my own implementation to request this directly on the network like real nodes do, and include my logic instead?

A kind of ethereum client that  sync only a specific part of the state and does not store or verify transactions",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609
Reddit,ethereum,Can somebody explain how people are still paying $23 or over that for gas fees in the second half of 2024?,2024-12-27 17:18:42,"Hi. I was just following an ETH thread in the cryptocurrency subreddit and various people are claiming they are paying about $30 or even more than that for their gas fees for L1 transactions.

For example, [I saw this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hm4k11/comment/m3tigd0/
):

> Yeah I try to swap $45 worth of ETH for a coin I want and it's costing me $23 gas fees. No thanks. 

I have read other comments in the past few weeks of people still paying something like upper $20 range for gas fees, and I assume their transactions were recently?

How is this possible though?  Checking the gas fee chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#1y, the highest average gas fee in the last 6 months was $14 USD on November 13th.  The gas fee has generally been lower than that in the last 6 months for Ethereum.

I haven't seen any average gas fee over $20 USD since March of 2024 according to that chart.  So how are people still paying like $23, or even in the upper $20 range for their gas fees lately?",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,ethereum,Beginner confused about networks,2024-12-26 11:16:47,"Hi all, 

I’m fairly new to crypto and find the networks quite overwhelming. 

I can choose from Ethereum (ERC20), Optimism, Arbitrum One, or Base network. 

Unfortunately I do not know the difference between these - all I know, is I don’t want to pay the exorbitant fees from the ERC20 network. 

Can I just randomly choose the same low fee network on my sending and receiving end, or is there a process to using other networks, e.g., buying supporting coins for a transaction? 

I also noticed the differing networks have their own amount of eth storage. If you send eth using a specific network, it’ll stay on that network forever? You can never combine all your eth? 

Are there any negatives of using different networks to avoid exorbitant fees?

As you can see, I’m quite confused, any help would be much appreciated!!

Thanks ",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609
Reddit,ethereum,Looking for a library of known ETH addresses (like ones owned by exchanges etc),2024-12-26 11:24:01,"Hey all,  
My brother has discovered that his Edge wallet has been completely emptied.   
A few hours after he deposited his ETH (in 2021), they were all transferred to an unknown address.  
The address is 0x3c681f08353c39c0fcea3a04a56f381796bce7e8  
And according to its history it may be an exchange deposit wallet. It has transacted a total volume of $128M, which looks organizational to say the least. 

I'm now trying to understand if I can associate this address with a known entity and investigate further.   
Does anyone have an idea where to look?

Thanks!",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,ethereum,PoS vs. PoW: Energy Efficiency – Is That All? ,2024-12-22 19:15:06,"The blockchain was supposed to be this revolution of trust, decentralization, and equity; instead, here we are, debating the use of Proof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS). Let me break it down.



The original blockchain model is Proof of Work, think Bitcoin: where miners solve complex puzzles in the interest of securing a network. It is power-hungry: just Bitcoin, in and of itself, uses 91 TWh per year-the equivalent of several small countries. Kudos to temper some criticism for its environmental impact.



This, in turn, ushers in the green replacement through PoS. It operates with validators who stake their tokens by way of miners for locking up the network. After ETH moved into PoS in 2022, its energy usage went down by 99.95%. Great, huh? But here is the kicker: most PoS networks have a tendency to centralize power amongst the richest validators; hence, it's at great risk in regard to fairness and security.



So, is it all about energy, or is energy efficiency just a smoke screen for deeper trade-offs in scalability, regulatory compliance, or control?  

 Fact: It is that both systems are saddled with their strong points and weaknesses.  

 PoW is ultra-secure and battle-tested; it is very power-consuming. 

 PoS is scalable, efficient, and user-friendly but has its own risks in centralization.



It's not really a question of choosing over another; it's all about innovation. Hybrid systems, such as NCOG Earth Chain, already mix in security from PoW and efficiency from PoS, renewable energy, and sustainability goals in their quest for that perfect balance. 



It all boils down to energy: building blockchains that uphold decentralization, fairness, and transparency in this ever-changing world.



Well, what do you think about it? Do we resolve actual problems or scratch where it doesn't itch? Leave a comment below.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about reconstructing rollups state,2024-12-21 12:56:14,"Hi!

I'm not sure to understand sequencers correctly.
 
Is it possible to reconstruct the state of an L2 only based on rollups smart contracts on L1, without any L2 node existing?

As far a as I understand, we need at least 1 honest node to do so because:
- L2's sequencer only posts compressed data and proof on L1
- the detailed transactions are maintained by the nodes and operators on L2
- technically, a new node could confirm the new state is valid by checking the last merkle root posted on L1, but couldn't derive history of transactions based on the L1 smart contract only.

Am I right?",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,ethereum,A history of grants and public goods funding on the blockchain,2024-12-19 17:11:44,"The Ethereum grants ecosystem, unsurprisingly begins with the Ethereum foundation. In April of 2015, the EF launched [ÐΞVgrants.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/07/devgrants-help) DEVgrants offered funding strictly to existing projects which contribute to both the ""Ethereum platform"", and projects based on Ethereum. The nature of this grants scheme was pretty standard and not particularly innovative. It was quite simply a grants scheme where grantees made a submission outlining their plans and estimated costs which was reviewed by a board of EF team members and funding was released either upon achieving milestones or partially upfront and partially upon completion. So the TL;DR is that it's nothing too exciting yet. Just simple incentives to get people building with pretty standard terms and conditions which you'd also find for grants outside of the web 3 ecosystem.

Not a lot happened through the next year, but a couple of important things happened in 2016 which lay the foundation for the future of the grants ecosystem. First, in the latter half of 2016, Giveth was founded by Griff Green, Jordi Baylina, and a few other members of the White Hat Group. They would soon after launch Giveth, an on-chain donation and crowdfunding service in 2017 which saw a modest amount of use. At the same time throughout late 2016 and 2017, ICOs started raising obscene amounts of ETH. So much ETH that one of the largest funders of public goods to this day, the Golem Foundation raised 820,000 ETH. That's a whopping 0.66% of all ETH in existence today! However, at $10/ETH in November 2016, it was only $8.7M which is paltry by today's standards or even 2017 standards. But we'll get back to Giveth and Golem later...

By the time 2018 rolled around, the bull market full of false promises evolved into a brutal bear and for many people that means it's a build market. In March, the EF did another big round of grants funding. This time, with 13 projects receiving a combined total of $2.5M. This was still a shadow of the money available today, but a nice boost for many projects. However, the big news this year was a research paper written by Vitalik, Zoë Hitzig and E. Glen Weyl in September of 2018. [""Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds""](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656), or as we know it today, quadratic funding or quadratic matching.

Quadratic funding proposes that when funds are to be allocated, individuals within a community can vote for the project by contributing funding to the projects and causes they prefer. Then each vote is weighted using a quadratic function to find a balance between large donors having more influence and smaller donors having their voice heard. That way, more funds will go to Project A which received 100 x $1 donations than Project B which received one single $100 donation. This is more effective because Project A clearly benefits more people, whereas Project B simply benefits one person a lot. This prevents wealthy individuals from having an outsized influence on the distribution of public goods funding and leads to a more democratic outcome while still incentivising large donors to contribute to public goods to have more influence over the funding distribution.

Quadratic funding transitioned from research to reality in 2019 with the launch of Gitcoin. Gitcoin has been running quarterly rounds since then which involve a large pool of matching funds and a large number of projects for the community to donate to. Gitcoin then uses quadratic matching to allocate the main pool funds to the projects depending on the nature of how many people donated how much to each project. The matching funds originally were primarily EF funded but over time this scope has grown to large ecosystem players like Polygon, Chainlink and even outsider organisations for non-crypto project rounds like UNICEF. Since 2019, Gitcoin has funded over 6,000 different projects and allocated over $63M in funding. Nowadays, Gitcoin is a pillar of public goods funding in Ethereum and after tweaking and experimenting, they have learned some lessons about public goods funding and have taken those lessons into account for creating Allo Protocol. Allo Protocol is an open-source, decentralised, modular protocol to enable efficient and transparent allocation of pooled capital on-chain, thus allowing other communities to institute their own quadratic funding more easily.

Stepping back a bit after our quadratic tangent, after the launch of Gitcoin, the next key points in the development of the grants and funding ecosystem came in the 2020 and 2021 bull run. This is when the funding ecosystem started to properly bloom, but it would take a few years for that to fully play out and we're still working on some novel solutions to the problems which arose from this period today. With the influx of new projects, lots of VC funding and particularly L2 ecosystems and apps which are all in an arms race to build out the biggest ecosystem first, there was an explosion of more simple milestone based grants for funding, this time primarily for ecosystem specific grants. The result is that builders are spoiled for choice for places to build and get funding. On the other hand, it can also be a bit overwhelming. Here to help you with where you can get funding is [Ecosystem.vision](https://ecosystem.vision) and [KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/projects), both of whom have a large database of nearly all of the ongoing grants and funding opportunities in the wider web 3 space. But more on KarmaGAP later as we have two more noteworthy innovations from 2021 to cover.

Also born out of the 2021 bull run is Optimism's retroactive public goods funding (RPGF). Unlike a lot of ecosystems and L2s which offered grants for project building in their respective ecosystems, Optimism opted for another strategy. Rather than funding speculative projects which might make an impact, they instead look towards retroactive funding of impactful projects as voted on by Optimism governance. They make the case that it is more effective and efficient to fund successful projects after the fact, letting prospective builders know that if they build something useful without the expectation of profits, they will be rewarded. The history of their funding rounds could warrant a post of its own, but essentially they have slowly *optimised* ^^(heh) their mechanisms. Most recently opting for more focused, themed rounds to constantly change who the recipients are and to minimise the same people with the best networks and brand recognition from being repeatedly rewarded and sometimes over-rewarded. Finally, while I was talking face to face with Karl Floersch from Optimism at Devcon 7, in true Karl fashion, he excitedly and confidently expressed his excitement for their next big development in the RPGF space which he thinks will be an a real game changer for public goods funding. While I received no hints as to the nature of this next evolution, given Optimism (formerly Plasma Group)'s history, I am expecting good things to come from this. So watch this space.

Finally, we return to Giveth. After many years of facilitating a modest amount of crowdfunding and donations, Giveth launched the $GIV token with an airdrop to previous donors, contributors, and collaborators. With it comes the V2 version of Giveth known as the GIVeconomy which uses tokenomic incentives to encourage donations. The TL;DR is that donors get kickbacks referred to as GIVbacks in the form of the GIV token. The token is then used in governance for the protocol and also in deciding how to spend the project's significant (in terms of total GIV supply) treasury of GIV tokens. Unfortunately, the inflationary tokenomics have lead to a pretty catastrophic price chart, but many projects have been helped from Giveth funding and while not as prolific or impactful as Gitcoin, they've been a leader in terms of experimentation and there's still a core community there. In 2024, they raised a respectable $1.55M for projects. Looking forwards, they're also looking to build out integrate a new feature involving augmented bonding curves which is probably out of the scope of this post but should help with the sustainability of funding projects receive.

Finally, we get to the ongoing work being done by KarmaGAP (the GAP means Grants Accountability Protocol). KarmaGAP is trying to solve two key problems:

- How do you ensure that grant money is spent effectively and that the people you give money to actually use it to do what they say they will?

- The current web 3 grant ecosystem is incredibly fractured and developers don't have time to maintain profiles and fill in forms across dozens of websites and grants platforms in the name of *maybe* receiving funding.

KarmaGAP aims to be the industry standard in grants and funding accountability. By having projects post updates there, the idea is that they will no longer need to post updates to half a dozen different websites, each of which want different formats when checking in on project progress and how grant money has been spent. This allows donors to easily check the reputation of projects/grantees to allow them to get more funding and it allows projects/grantees to save time applying for and reporting back to grantors.

**Now that we're all up to date, who are the main players you should know about when funding your project?**

- Gitcoin - Claim your share of large matching pools powered by quadratic funding every quarter.

- Octant - Funded by 100,000 staked ETH raised by the aforementioned Golem ICO, Octant runs regular quadratic funding rounds much like Gitcoin. GLM token holders who lock their tokens in Octant can influence project selection and earn ETH rewards. Users can then choose to keep their rewards or donate them to eligible public goods projects, with donations amplified through a matching pool.

- Optimism Retroactive Public Goods Funding - Optimism's RPGF rounds are very large and they're a key innovator in the space. While their current rounds are narrow in scope, keep an eye our for future rounds and innovations which everyday builders may qualify for.

- KarmaGAP - Make your project's profile here to build up your reputation and get more success in receiving funding from all of the different players in the grants ecosystem.

- Ecosystem.vision - The most comprehensive list of grants opportunities. Now featuring an AI tool to help search for relevant grants based on the nature of your project.

My goal is to provide a space where users can be creative, while exploring wallets and blockchain technology without worrying about investments or risks.

Here’s the idea in a nutshell:



* The canvas is infinite, with each cell holding a stack of images on the z-axis. Only the top image is visible (in 2D mode).
* You can place your image on the canvas by paying a small fee in ETH to each owner of an image below yours (0.0001 ETH per owner). The more layers there are below, the more it costs, but if other put an image on top of yours = you'll earn.
* The first image in any column gets to name that column.
* Every image you place becomes an NFT stored on Arweave, making your contribution visible, tradable, and traceable (including any outstanding payments).

[https://defidiorama.onrender.com/](https://defidiorama.onrender.com/)



How to Test It:

	1.	Get some test ETH for Arbitrum Sepolia (write me a pm if you have no other means)

	2.	Connect your wallet (MetaMask, etc.) and head over to the site.

	3.	Create a 64x64 pixel image (RGB), upload it, and pick a spot on the canvas.

	4.	Experiment with the features—stack images, explore the canvas, and have fun!



I’d love for you to give it a try and share your feedback. Any thoughts, suggestions, or ideas for improvement are more than welcome. I would also appreciate it if someone could identify any security issues in the contract.



Excited for any feedback!

Reddit,ethereum,Looking for insight and direction for my project-Vereum,2024-12-18 18:46:18,"Vereum was launched on base in October. My initial thought was to use tax funds to gain enough traction to get the platform built and operational. This fell short will non preforming calls and my lack of how to properly communicate the idea.    
  
Vereum would be a new community based platform for all of web3. This would rebrand the traditional idea of social media to a social ledger that embodies innovation, creativity and learning in its core. It would have a ecosystem with various services for all users and gamified features  that would enhance community involvement such as a raid mechanism known as The Arena-amongst others.   
  
The idea is to create a real place for communities and projects to grow, thrive and be discovered. Communities in this space are fractured by all other platforms. They help draw in users over time, but what I want to build will cater to every aspect of blockchain and crypto communities by having a true ""home base"". 

The initial goal is building a knowledge base forum ( think reddit) but adding in aspects that amplify the needs of businesses, founders, startups and users. There are two style forums,-project and regular communities that are based on any topic. Both having their own and similar features to enhance experience.  
  
The platform would also add in tools to help remove some risk of buying into a project. This is where the knowledge base comes into play. We would also help new users to cyrpto have an easier transition to the space. In the long term we would expand past the web3 barrier and push to establish as a major platform.

I have a lot on paper for just about every aspect of the platform, but lack the technical capability to build and properly market. Since the launch (as some would expect) it has struggled to take off, and I know that's all on me. This is even more of a reason I want this to become a reality, as there are tons of great ideas out there, but people don't act on them bc of limitations.   
  
I have built somewhat of an mvp with [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) as this was the easiest way i could get me idea of the paper. It has most of the initial features I wanted, but they recently made some changes and a lot of projects are stuck in loops and I'm burning through tokens. 

I'm looking for insight on how to best find team members or investors that I can show of the idea and get help to move forward. Ideally team members would be set up with tokens and a vesting schedule or partnership.  
  
 The market need is ripe, if it can be built in the right way. I have an innovative and creative mindset, I just need the help to make this a true reality. 

Any input or direction is appreciated and thank you for your time.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin is fundamentally simple. Here's how it works.,2025-01-01 22:43:42,"1. **Bitcoin Transactions:**
   * Transactions are made when users send Bitcoin to one another. Each transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
   * These transactions wait in the **mempool** (a temporary holding area) until they are included in a block by a miner.
2. **Blocks:**
   * A block is essentially a ""page"" in the Bitcoin ledger that contains a list of verified transactions.
   * Each block references the previous block through a cryptographic link (the hash of the previous block), forming a chain — the **blockchain** — which is the entire history of Bitcoin transactions.
3. **Miners' Role:**
   * Miners compete to create the next block by solving a cryptographic puzzle (Proof-of-Work).
   * The first miner to solve the puzzle adds the new block to the blockchain and broadcasts it to the network.
   * As a reward, the miner earns the **block reward** (newly minted Bitcoin) and **transaction fees** from the transactions in the block.
4. **Nodes' Role:**
   * Full nodes receive the newly mined block and **validate** it to ensure it follows Bitcoin's rules (e.g., no double-spending, proper block structure, valid transactions).
   * Nodes store a full copy of the blockchain and enforce consensus rules. They reject any invalid blocks or transactions.
   * By doing so, nodes ensure the network remains secure and decentralized. There are thousands of Bitcoin nodes around the world, many operated by individuals, businesses, and institutions making it impossible for anyone to change Bitcoin without the majority of these nodes agreeing to the change. 
   * **Bitcoin Nodes in Space**:
      * **Blockstream Satellite**: Blockstream has launched satellites into orbit that broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain to the entire Earth. This allows users to access Bitcoin without an internet connection, ensuring resilience during internet outages or censorship. Users only need a simple satellite dish and receiver to connect.
   * **EMP-Resistant Nodes**:
      * **Faraday Cage Nodes**: While specific examples of individual nodes aren't publicly advertised for security reasons, enthusiasts and businesses have built Bitcoin nodes inside Faraday cages to protect against EMPs. For instance, some survivalist communities incorporate EMP-hardened Bitcoin nodes as part of their disaster preparedness setups.
   * **Bunker Nodes**:
      * **The Swiss Fort Knox**: Several companies operate Bitcoin nodes in heavily fortified data centers, such as the ones buried deep in Swiss mountains. These facilities are designed to withstand natural disasters, EMPs, and even military attacks.
      * **The Underground Data Center in Stockholm**: Located in a former nuclear bunker, this facility houses Bitcoin nodes and other critical infrastructure, designed to survive extreme conditions.
   * **Decentralized Distribution**:
      * **Home and Business Nodes**: Many individuals run Bitcoin nodes in their homes or offices worldwide. While not as protected as the examples above, the sheer number of nodes (tens of thousands globally) ensures the network continues to function even if some go offline.
5. These examples highlight the extraordinary measures taken by Bitcoin users and organizations to ensure the network remains operational under any circumstances. 
6. **Decentralized Ledger:**
   * The blockchain, stored on nodes worldwide, acts as the official, tamper-proof record of Bitcoin's transaction history.
   * This decentralized ledger prevents any single entity from altering the history or rules of Bitcoin.

# Key Points to Remember:

* **Miners:** Create and propose new blocks by expending computational power.
* **Nodes:** Validate and store the blockchain, ensuring it adheres to Bitcoin’s consensus rules.
* **Blockchain:** A chronological and cryptographically secure ledger that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions.",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,bitcoin,How I explained Bitcoin wallets to my 12 year old nephew.  Am I correct? ,2025-01-01 15:47:43,"
This is how I explained it to my nephew, please let me know if I’m way off…


Imagine a universe with an infinite amount of planets, more planets than there are atoms in the entire universe we live in. 
Each of those planets is a BTC wallet. 


When you generate a wallet, you’re essentially planting your personal flag on one of those planets and laying claim to it (you don’t create the planet - it already exists). You can store your digital assets right there on the surface of the planet, like treasure. 

Your planet can only be found with your private keys/seed phrase - it’s like a map. This map is the most important part of your wallet and must be protected at all times. A hardware wallet is basically a device that connects you directly to your planet, with your map built into it. It makes accessing your planet a lot easier. 
 
It’s highly unlikely anyone will ever land on your planet by accident as there’s just so many of them out there. 

 There’s space pirates out there who would love to land on people’s planets to steal their treasure, but it costs them too much money to travel from planet to planet - so it’s highly unlikely they’ll ever find one with treasure on it. 
Instead, these pirates try to trick people into giving them their map - That’s why it’s important to never share it with anyone, no matter what. 

Anyone can look at the planets (wallet addresses) through a telescope and see what’s on each planet, but they can’t get there without the map.

If you want to be extra-secure, you can use a passphrase wallet, which kinda creates an underground bunker on your planet. You can store your treasure in there, so if anyone does ever land on your planet, they’ll think it’s an empty one. You could even leave a small amount of funds on the surface as a trap, so you’ll know if anyone ever lands there. 

And to be even safer, you can lay claim to multiple planets, or create multiple underground bunkers on the same planet. The options you have are limitless. 

While nobody can access your planet, anyone can send funds there - it’s kinda like your planet has an email address. This is known as your wallet address or public keys. 


Is this a good analogy to make wallets more understandable for kids? 

Edit: Michael Saylor often refers to BTC as a bank in cyberspace, this is why I went with a space analogy. And thanks to all those who left positive comments!

Reddit,bitcoin,Just found my mnemonic phrase from 2013-14,2025-01-02 11:50:13,"Hey, so just browsed files from the old pc and found the mnemonic phrase, it contains 16 words and I just can't recover the wallet.

Is it possible to recover it somehow? Scammers can walk away cause I am not a 13yo boy now:)

Reddit,bitcoin,Using 2 of 2 multisig to avoid risk of supply chain tampering,2025-01-02 10:05:27,"I am living in a country in which it is incredibly difficult to get hold of a hardware wallet, as most things are opened on arrival at customs and there's often no way of telling for sure if they have been tampered with. I am probably being paranoid here, but it's for my own peace of mind. I'm sure everyone has heard stories of people who have bought from Amazon and eBay...

I know the general consensus with most people is that 2 of 3 is the best way to go with multisig setup, but living abroad as an expat, that isn't really feasible in my case as it usually involves multiple addresses. Instead, I was thinking of going with 2 of 2 multisig, one 12 word key generated by the hardware wallet, and an additional 12 word key generated by the software wallet (sparrow or bluewallet), so 24 words in total when combined.

My thinking is that the key from the hardware wallet will be generated offline, and will not be accessible to hackers even if the software wallet is compromised, whilst the key from the software wallet would prevent any of the risks coming from supply chain tampering, as potential hackers will not be able to get both (Please correct me if I'm wrong here!). 

I've heard of exploits where hardware wallets send keys to the hacker once generated, but in order for a hardware wallet to be able to send both the key it generates itself, and the key from the software wallet, it would need to be able to bypass both the iPhone OS security, and that of the software wallet. 

This should be pretty bulletproof right? And it only involves looking after a 24 word seed phrase, the same as if I just created a 24 word phrase using the hardware device alone.",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

The clock strikes twelve, a digital dawn, Bitcoin's enigma, a future forlorn? Or a genesis, where value takes flight, A decentralized hope, a beacon of light?

The halving's shadow, a mathematical dance, Supply constricts, a market's entranced. Network effects bloom, a vibrant display, As adoption surges, with each passing day.

The Austrian whispers, of sound money's grace, A finite supply, in this digital space. No central banks' whim, no inflationary blight, A refuge from chaos, a beacon of light.

Game theory unfolds, a complex design, Incentives align, a purpose divine. Miners secure, the blockchain's domain, A testament to trust, in this digital rain.

But volatility's grip, a constant refrain, A rollercoaster ride, of joy and of pain. The market's psyche, a fickle embrace, A dance with the unknown, in this digital space.

Yet, through the tempest, a vision endures, A currency borderless, a future that cures. Financial inclusion, for all humankind, A digital dawn, a future defined.

So let us raise glasses, to this audacious quest, To break free from shackles, and put fears to the test. For Bitcoin's destiny, is woven with fate, A digital revolution, sealed by its fate.

Reddit,bitcoin,UK users of exchanges: A cautionary tale,2025-01-01 12:32:39,"I recently watched a friend of mine open their exchange's app, to check their open orders. Upon opening the app, they were forced to complete an FCA mandated form. This form asks if you are earning above 100k or have 250k+ assets. My friend mistakenly indicated that they earn under 100k and have less than 250k in assets. They were shocked to see their account was immediately suspended and they were unable to see their portfolio, orders or any part of their account.

  
Fortunately, they were able to login and redo the form, correcting their mistake and indicating they earned either over 100k or had more than 250k in assets. They were then able to continue using their account as normal.

  
Be careful when completing such forms. It seems the UK government has decided that plebs are not smart enough to manage their own investments.",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

I know this story is old but it never gets old.

Had she simply done that 1 gig for those 200,000 bitcoins and held on to those bitcoins, which presumably she never needed anyway given that she was at the height of her career back then, she would be one of the biggest bitcoin whales on Earth and one of very limited number of outright multibillionaires on Earth. Even given the recent pullback to the current price in the mid $90k range, she would still be worth well over $18 Billion.

""What are Bitcoins?


Bitcoins are a new kind of money. They aren't created or controlled by a govemnment (like dollars or euros), they're
created and controlled by anybody who wants to be part of the Bitcoin payment network. Visit the Bitcoin.org website for all the geeky details.


How do I get a Bitcoin Receiving Address?


Download and install the Bitcoin program from www.biticoin.org. At the top of its main window it will show you Your Bitcoin Address.


I've got Bitcoins; how can I help?


Send them to the Bitcoin Faucet and they'll be given away. It may take up to 30 minutes for your donation to be added to the amount available


What's the catch?


No catch- want Bitcoin to be successful, so 1 created this Ittle service to give you a few coins to start with.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Ethereum sell targets,2025-01-02 08:38:07,"For those who are holding ETH, what is your bull exit plan?

Initially, my target was for 170,000$ BTC and with a 0.07 ratio about $12,000 ETH.

Recently, performance of ETH has been disappointing relative to bitcoin.

Historically it gains against btc during the Q1 post halving year, but historically it also performs much better on a halving year than it has this year, and historically it performs  much worse in a bear market than it did last bear market!

So there’s not really anything reliable to go off as the market is still evolving, and the Q1 pump on ETHBTC could very likely not come to fruition.

Based on this, I’ve set a ‘safe’ target of around 7k (0.04 ETHBTC with 170k BTC) with a bullish target of ~10k (~0.06 ETHBTC).

Obviously, I am fairly confident btc gets a 70% pump from here which will affect everything.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Reddit has a scammer issue, and they don't seem to care that much.  So here is what you can do about it. ",2025-01-01 19:56:02,"If you ever post about any issue you're having with a coin or wallet, the roaches come out of the dark and message you, sometimes claiming to be the developers, and offering to ""help"" by sending you a link to a website where they want you to connect your wallet.  This is almost always done privately, and oddly they like do it in the old reddit. 

The accounts they use are hacked accounts.  I report them using the Spam category. You can further select ""user is linking to malicious websites"".   However, Reddit doesn't seem to really act on this since the accounts remain active days afterwards. 

# So here's what you can do to take down these bastards:

* **Play into their scam.** Pretend you're an oblivious and ignorant victim that needs their help.  The goal here is to get them to send their scammy website URL to you.  This is not only proof for Reddit that they're a scammer but its important for the next step.

* **Identify their hosting server.** Without clicking on the link (it may have malicious code so don't click on it) copy the link and paste it into the URL portion of [VirusTotal.com](http://VirusTotal.com) This website will use multiple internet security scanning providers to scan the website for malicious code / bad behaviour and give you a report.  Click on the **Details** tab and look for ***server***.

[If you click on links inside of Virus Total, it stays in Virus Total. The links are often for further scans of that address or item.  So you don't have to worry about them directly linking you to a dangerous website. ](https://preview.redd.it/2asgbiv8ofae1.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=0287dad7d5f82cec3af7ddc39f795644dd2f9fc8)

FIDE agreed and now Polymarket betters are again claiming they were scammed, as Polymarket has determined the winner of the tournament to be neither Magnus Carlsen or Ian Nepomniachtchi but instead to give the win to ""Other""

\---------

# So What Happened?

Polymarket the prediction betting site on Polygon hosted a Market for who would win the World Blitz Chess   Championship and because the rules state there can only be one winner, Polymarket didn't think it was necessary to make a betting option for ""Multiple Winners"". This in hindsight has caused further scam accusations directed towards the platform as anyone who voted that Magnus or Ian would win has lost all of their money.

**Now logically one would think that if that two people win, this can be solved by giving both Ian and Magnus yes voters a 100% payout** as they both technically won and the only people losing money would be the people who thought they wouldn't win. However Polymarket is literally incapable of having more than one winner in a market. **If Magnus is marked as the winner Ian will be marked as the loser and if Ian is then marked as the winner - Magnus will be changed to the loser.**

>It is vital that markets prepared on the NegRiskAdapter never result in a tie or will be unable to be determined. For any given market, once one question is resolved as Yes/True, all other questions must be resolved as No/False. This means that if the chosen oracle returns a second question as Yes/True, the call to `reportOutcome` will revert, and the market may not be able to fully resolved. Similarly, it is expected that one question will resolve to Yes/True, and it should not be the case that all questions for a given market resolve to No/False. Keep this in mind when preparing markets and questions on the NegRiskAdapter. [source](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter)

So because Polymarket must have only one winner Polymarket has opted to make the ""other"" option the defacto winner of the World Blitz Chess Championship.

Now this will technically go to UMA to vote if ""Magnus should win"" (Ian has already been marked as a loser) or ""other should win"" but because UMA ""the decentralized Truth Machine"" is decided by two whales  [(seriously)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g06kgs/polymarket_bettors_are_heading_to_trustpilot_to/) who vote as Polymarket tells them, this will resolve as Other, and anyone who voted that either Magnus Carlsen would win or Ian Nepomniachtchi would win, will lose all of their money... even though they both technically won.

EDIT: Other was meant for ""someone not mentioned"" this dropped to .01% because everyone not mentioned had been knocked out by the end of day 1. You can view [this comment and my response](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hr9lmm/comment/m4w5wuc) to get a better idea of what that options was being used for (essentially it was meant for one of the underdogs not listed by name winning).

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Some golden rules for new investors,2025-01-01 11:58:40,"Happy New Year everyone. As a new year begins and new investors enter the crypto market this year like last year, I would like to share a few golden rules with you so that you don't get scammed and lose all your money:

1. Not you keys not your coins. In other words, if you want to invest a lot of money, buy a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor. Because as long as the coins/tokens (I'll just write coins for the sake of simplicity) are on the broker or exchange, you can lose them if they f\*ck up or the exchange goes bust (see FTX).
   1. If you have a hardware wallet (Cold Wallet) or a wallet created with an app such as Trust Wallet (Hot Wallet), never, absolutely NEVER share your 12 to 24 word phrase with anyone. This is the key to your wallet in the event of loss of login details. Also, do not take screenshots or photos of it that you then save on technical devices of any kind. It has often happened that people have revealed their phrase and had their wallets emptied as a result. Also do an antivirus scan on your devices to remove malware searching for any detail about crypto on your device
   2. Never buy hardware wallets from third-party providers, but only from the manufacturer itself. This is because third-party providers can provide you with hacked devices or devices with a phrase already attached and fake instructions, with which scammers can empty your wallet
2. Always DYOR (do your own research). Dont buy any coins trusting some crappy Youtubers. Many of them either don't know what they are saying or are paid by influencers or developers to advertise for their scamcoin. Also dont participate in anything you dont understund (Trading, Liquidity Pools, Lending, Staking or Leverage). Also be aware of Initial Coin Offers (ICO's). 99% of them are fake and/or scam. 
3. On social media, no one is your friend who wants to give you a hot tip or offer their help with problems. There are a lot of scammers lurking on all platforms. You will often receive DMs after almost every post about cryptocurrencies. Many will approach you in a very subtle and friendly way to suggest that they are not scammers. But they all are. Don't accept their DM request and be aware.
4. Only invest as much money as you can bear to lose. Don't invest money that you need. Diversify your portfolio. Dont invest all of your money into only one coin. 
5. Dont let emotions take control of you. Don't fall for hypes, don't do FOMO (fear of missing out) or lose your nerves if something goes down. The crypto market is very volatile and you have to be able to live with the fact that your portfolio can be down 30% from one day to the next, but you must also not fall into euphoria as soon as your portfolio is up 50%. Try to turn off your greed. As soon as you see something like this, realize profits (unless we are at the beginning of the bull market). Another indicator for selling is when even any crappy page or magazine suddenly starts talking about crypto. It's a bit of a meme, but it has proven to be true more than once. Sometimes its very hard to sell a coin to take profit. Because you sometimes build up an emotional hold on a coin. Just take the profit and never look back at what happened or what could be happen.
6. Do not buy any coins on decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Uniswap, Raydium, Pancakeswap etc. until you have gained enough experience in the crypto sector in general. There are a lot of scams lurking there that can either empty your wallet because you give them the authorization to do so or fall for a honeypot where you only serve as a provider of liquidity but can no longer sell anything so that the scammer can cash out. 
   1. If you have some experience, then always check the contract adress which you can find on [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) or [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), before buying a coin. Also check if a coin is a scam on pages like [Token Sniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/). You should also know which DEX runs on which chain. Its a bit more complicated but for example Uniswap runs on the Ethereum Chain. Therefore you won't be able to find coins which run on the Solana chain like PENGU. If you search for PENGU you will get some coins who are named the same but are either different ones or just scams. Always work with the contract adress. And if you are not sure, do research about it at first

So those were my tips for you. If I have forgotten something, please feel free to add it. I wish everyone a healthy new year and lots of profits. Take care",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,UK specific off-ramp exchange advice needed. Much appreciated!,2025-01-01 08:13:44,"I’ll get straight to the point, my many years old Coinbase account was randomly closed a couple of months ago despite only ever using it as a fiat off-ramp, all aboveboard (KuCoin etc> Coinbase> bank) but as we all know, there is no ability to plead your innocence or have the decision overturned with these people. So I swallowed the losses, sold up and moved on despite genuinely having no idea what flagged their system after all this time and hundreds of easily traceable and verifiable transactions.

Following the advice of the good people here, I then opened a Kraken account since it can do everything that Coinbase did. The account creation went fine, and had the account up and running just doing the same occasional off-ramping I’ve always done with no snags at all. Then a couple of days ago, a deposit of USDT was put on hold but I didn’t think anything of it. I reached out to support and was told I needed to prove where the crypto came from etc, no problem I gave them all the relevant information and am now awaiting a response. But having read the stories here, I have a strong suspicion that no matter what information I send, this account may just be auto closed too and I feel like I’m running out of options.

So, as someone who WANTS to do things safely and legally, what other options do I have for an off-ramp, specifically in the UK now that it’s possible I’ve “burned” the two biggest off-ramp exchanges somehow? I’m worried I may soon be stuck with crypto I cannot cash out without resorting to shadier methods, and I don’t want that. This is a legitimate income stream for me and I intend to do it the right way.

Any advice is appreciated, happy to answer any follow up questions.



TL;DR: What other options do I have left as a UK based person to actually SELL my crypto for GBP cash?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,ai16z future discussion,2025-01-01 15:33:36,"Happy New Year!!

This is not investing advice thread. Just a discussion, I want to know your thoughts and analysis on the ai16z token future.

Before explaining my point of view, I'm NOT a professional investor or trader, I do it as a hobby, and I've recently started developing some interest on the mathematical analysis of stocks and crypto. I'm a computer scientist so my interest is more into the technical part of ai16z rather than the speculative part, this is important to understand my opinion and probably the interpretation errors that I have and that I would appreciate if you could correct.

Said this, I'm heavily divided. On the technical part, the project is hella promissing and it deserves the love it is getting, but the Eliza project is still in an alpha state, as you can see on their github. I feel optimistic about the agent and the use cases it will have, but, how this connects to the token price? Here is where I'm divided. The token is already #200 on market capitalization, 2B in. This could be understandable for a project which is already developed and working great, but it is still an alpha, what can happen then when the project gets fully released? Usually the boom on successful projects comes after the releasing, but this is extremely big already. Do I think it will drop and it is overhyped? Not at all. The question is, How much can the token's value increase? If it would do a x2 in market capitalization it would surpass Virtual value rn and become top 30-40. I feel like this is doable, and will happen, but what comes after that? The hedge fund functionality is something to keep and eye on. If I'm not mistaken, when fully developed it will invest the money put into the coin and make investments which might increase the value, with the potential to reject speculative bear tendencys on the coin value, something which as far as I know havent happened before AI tokens appeared, as the value of them would depend completly on the money put into them, they couldnt ""generate"" more value by themselves. This can be huge, bring the token price even further up, but then again I ask myself... How far can it go? If it does a x3 it would be top 36, a x5 would mean top 20, x10 almost top 10, same value as coins that had been sucessfull past multiple cycles.

So here it is the discrepance. We are talking about a token which has done more than a x130 during the alpha version of the project, but has a potential of doing a x2 or x5 short term (Prolly after I say this, it will go down into the bottom as always happens :p) and it could happen that the project would still not be fully developed when the x5 happens. But what comes after that? Usually the real big movement comes after an start-up or project fully develops and proves to be successful, but this one is ""touching the roof"" way before that. So what is his future? What could we expect?

My division/discrepance is that technically I could believe that the ""good"" part comes now, because something successful is about to come. But looking at the crypto market it seems like it can't go too far up (short term) when the project gets released (x2, x5) which is faaaaaaaar less than the increase it did before.

To end this ""monologue"" I want to set my bets which AGAIN are NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I'M FOR SURE 100% MISTAKEN. But just to come again to this post in some weeks/months and get a good laugh:

I'm bullish on the token and the project. I would say a x2 in the next weeks, and from that point I dont know at all what could happen. Maybe a x5 when the final projects gets released. But I dont see how could it go further than that as the market is rn.

What are your thoughts?

Has anyone emailed their State organizations that banned coinbase staking and asked for any timeline or pathway to allowing this moving forward?

I just emailed the Wisconsin DFI at [DFISecurities@dfi.wisconsin.gov](mailto:DFISecurities@dfi.wisconsin.gov) and expressed my frustration. I'm sure it won't go anywhere but it would be nice to get a response. I know there are other ways to stake, but Coinbase makes it easy. Yeah yeah not your keys not your coins. I feel its more likely I'll lose my own keys in a house fire than that coinbase will get hacked or whatever and I'll lose it all. They've been around since 2016 and stayed strong through COVID. I'd rather stake on Coinbase than hold on Robinhood (which is also uninsured and in the unlikely event Robinhood goes under I'll probably lose it)

To this day, Satoshi’s true identity remains a mystery.  In 2011, Satoshi made their last known communication, effectively handing over the reins completely to the community.  Satoshi’s story is truly unique and, is one of the most fascinating the world has ever known.

It just struck me as important to remember that at this point, cryptocurrency has no value for the common person. It is debatable if it will ever have a use for the common person. Because of that, ALL talk about ""performance,"" and *especially* future performance of an asset is disingenuous.

This space is the definition of speculative. No one has an inside track on this. No one. So anything you read speaking with authority about the future of some coin or token is utter bullshit. I would also take note of WHO is posting these memes, because it tends to be the same accounts who are no doubt bag holding whatever asset the meme implies is good.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Yet another Bitcoin cycle analysis,2024-12-31 19:08:46,"Back in February 2024, I posted some analysis looking at Bitcoin cycles **not by the halving date**, but how each cycle performed from the low.  

Original post link:  

>[A New Take on Bitcoin Halving Cycles](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1avqlgj/a_new_take_on_bitcoin_halving_cycles/)  
by[u/Slimalicious](https://www.reddit.com/user/Slimalicious/) in[CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)

So let's see how this updated chart looks:

X-axis represents the number of days from each cycle's low.

Y-axis represents the % growth from that cycle's low.

The dot marker for each line represents the halving date for that cycle.  

[Bitcoin price multiple from each cycle low \(e.g. 2024 low was $15,780 on 11\/22\/2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/an8i4gumd8ae1.png?width=1810&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f85eacf2feb12fee7cbf41510e314c959234ef0)

As we can see, 2024 (yellow line) is tracking almost perfectly to the 2016 cycle, but slightly lower than 2020.  According to this chart, we are currently on day 770 of this bull cycle.  Previous cycles have taken almost 1,100 days to reach their ATH from the low, indicating that we may be looking at a new ATH in Q4 2025.  

**Thats financial advice, loser.  Time to take out a HELOC and yolo it all.**

What this chart doesn't take into account are any macro economic conditions.  Obviously there's been a ton of noise around inflation for our current cycle.  This time last year, all the big brains were saying Bitcoin's bull cycle was dead, killed by the highest Fed Funds Rate in a decade.  Well guess what gaylords:  Bitcoin eclipsed $100k, and hit $108k, with a FFR of 4.75%.   

Another new variable in this cycle, as we all know, are the Bitcoin ETFs.  Well right now, the top 5 ETFs hold 1.05 MILLION BITCOIN.  That's 5% of the total mined supply.  Taking into account the estimated lost bitcoin increased that to 7%.   7%!  In less than a year!  And large financial institutions, wealth managers, 401ks, etc. still have yet to adopt!  The bullish impact on supply is staggering to comprehend. 

And lastly, of course the regulatory change implications from the new administration are in play.  

Bullish news I'm looking for in 2025:

* SEC lawsuits against Coinbase/Binance are dropped
* Large wealth managers (e.g. LPL Financial) begin pushing Bitcoin ETFs
* Large tech companies begin holding Bitcoin ETFs on their balance sheets
* Large financial institutions begin holding Bitcoin ETFs on their balance sheets
* Crypto market is designated to be regulated by CFTC
* Real World Asset tokenization continues to be explored
* Stablecoin regulatory bills are passed by Congress (look for Visa/Mastercard adoption)

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };
    
    struct xws initializer(__uint128_t x_init, __uint128_t weyl_init, const __uint128_t s_init)
    {
        __uint128_t x = 0;

An additional feature is backtracking resistance, since it is not based on a bijective function, you must guess at least one bit in each iteration to reverse it, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05079. What do you think?",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609

Given SHA256 is supposed to be random and well distributed, is it true to say that essentially each output can have an infinite and relatively equal number of collisions generated by infinite inputs.

i.e. given in reality we have infinite inputs to feed the function (think arbitrary long binary numbers), can we assume that a properly functioning hash function has ""even and reachable"" collisions across it's output space?

Reddit,crypto,Going from KEM to Signatures,2024-10-13 12:46:29,"Is there a known efficient way to generically convert a secure KEM into a signature scheme? I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme.  
I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2025-01-02 12:19:01.670609
