Over the past month alone, SUI has increased by more than 100%, with its 7-day performance still seeing green up by 11.8% after nearly touching its all-time high of $2.17 yesterday with a 24-hour high of $2.13. Although the asset is currently facing a price decline down by 4.3% in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $1.99, a prominent crypto analyst known as CryptoBullet has taken to his X account to address investors on whether now is the best time to sell SUI. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand Should You Sell Your SUI Now? While it may seem tempting for some to sell during this price dip, CryptoBullet suggests otherwise. The analyst noted, “I know it might be tempting to sell SUI here, but it’s the wrong timing imo [in my opinion].” The analyst explained that the crypto is experiencing its fourth test of the $2 level, a key technical point, adding that “the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to break.” CryptoBullet believes this could indicate a bullish breakout, pointing to the formation of a Cup and Handle pattern. Additionally, CryptoBullet highlighted some of SUI’s achievements that could further propel its bullish case. These include a market cap that nearly reached $6 billion, a transaction per second (TPS) rate exceeding 1,000 for the past three days, and SUI ranking as the second-largest non-EVM chain by total value locked (TVL) at $1.08 billion. Strong Growth Ahead For Ecosystem? Another crypto analyst known as ‘Easy’ on X echoed CryptoBullet’s optimism, comparing SUI’s potential to Solana’s meteoric rise in 2021. According to the analyst, “Sleeping on SUI is like sleeping on SOL in 2021.” He emphasized that SUI’s metrics, including TVL and trading volume, are showing strong growth, which could indicate that the crypto is poised for a significant bull run.

Meanwhile, gold’s higher risk-adjusted returns reaffirmed its “safe haven” narrative. Despite The Gains, Bitcoin Fails To Outshine Gold The leading digital asset by reported market cap surged from roughly $42,000 at the beginning of the year to as high as $73,000 in March 2024, recording more than 73% gains. At its current market price of $62,790, BTC is still more than 40% up from its price in January 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation With Gold Now At Highest Level Since March Notably, throughout 2024, Bitcoin has consistently outperformed major equity indices, fixed-income instruments, gold, and crude oil.   However, according to data tracked by Goldman Sachs, despite BTC’s impressive gains, its price performance in absolute terms fails to compensate for its volatility. The analysis by Goldman Sachs puts BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) volatility ratio at just under 2%. In comparison, gold gave a risk-adjusted return of 3%, posting strong 28% gains in absolute terms. For the uninitiated, the volatility ratio measures the return an asset generates for each unit of risk or volatility it carries. A higher ratio indicates that an asset provides better returns relative to the risk taken, while a lower ratio suggests less efficient performance.  The analysis notes that Bitcoin’s volatility ratio was only better than Ethereum’s native ETH token, S&P GSCI Energy Index, and Japan’s TOPIX index among the non-fixed income growth-sensitive investments. Bitcoin’s low volatility ratio compared to gold cements the latter’s claim as a “safe haven asset.” This came under the limelight last week when BTC slumped, and gold surged following Iran’s offensive against Israel. Still A Long Way To Go For Bitcoin Since its inception following the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin’s ascent to a trillion-dollar market cap asset has been remarkable.  The fixed supply of 21 million, decentralized network architecture, and halving every four years make BTC an appealing asset. However, the market cap gap between Bitcoin and gold remains vast. That said, several crypto analysts are confident that Bitcoin will outperform the shining metal in the coming years. For instance, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt recently made an ambitious prediction that by 2025, BTC could see its price jump 400% relative to gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Brink Of Massive Breakout Like Gold In 2008: Hedge Fund CEO Similarly, in August 2024, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck stated that BTC could surge to $350,000 on the back of greater adoption. Most recently, investment management firm BlackRock declared Bitcoin a “gold alternative” due to its fixed supply and increasing investor confidence in its ability to tackle inflation and avoid value erosion during uncertain times. On the contrary, billionaire Ray Dalio has expressed his opinion on the Bitcoin vs. gold narrative, saying that BTC will never fully replace gold.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"ETH’s Fate Hinges On $2,300: Will Ethereum Soar To $6,000 Or Dive To $1,600?",2024-10-09 10:00:38+00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant volatility in recent weeks, dropping from a one-month high of nearly $2,730 at the end of September to around $2,400, raising concerns about the medium-term price sustainability of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum Rally To $6,000 If $2,300 Support Holds Ethereum has fallen 7% in the past two weeks, with a key support level now at $2,300. This support is crucial for bullish investors hoping for a resurgence that could push ETH to new all-time highs. According to technical analyst Ali Martinez, this moment is pivotal for Ethereum’s future price trajectory. Martinez suggests that if ETH can maintain its support above $2,300, a rally toward $6,000 might be on the horizon.  Such a surge would significantly increase, surpassing Ethereum’s previous all-time peak of $4,878 in November 2021. If this bullish scenario plays out, it could translate to a substantial 150% increase from current trading levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 Conversely, if Ethereum fails to hold above the $2,300 support level in the short term, Martinez warns that ETH’s price could drop to around $1,600.  This would signify a decline of nearly 34% from current levels, exacerbating the losses experienced during previous market corrections on August 5 and September 6, when ETH fell by more than 20% on each occasion. The potential loss of the $2,000 mark would also be particularly significant, marking a psychological barrier that has not been breached since November 2023.  This time frame corresponds with a broader market uptrend that continued until the end of the first quarter of 2024, underscoring the importance of the $2,300 support level for Ethereum’s bullish outlook. ETH Underperforms Broader Crypto Market In addition to the absence of bullish catalysts for the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market, CoinGecko data indicates a notable lack of investor engagement. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) recorded a trading volume of only 5%, amounting to $14 billion. Moreover, Ethereum is currently underperforming compared to the broader cryptocurrency market, which has risen nearly 3%. In contrast, ETH’s price has declined by almost 6% over the past week, with losses exceeding 2% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Options Set To Supercharge Price Volatility, Expert Warns This price stagnation may be linked to losing key moving averages (MAs) over the past two weeks. The 50-day MA is currently positioned just above ETH’s trading price at $2,459, as illustrated by the blue line in the ETH/USDT daily chart below, which currently acts as a resistance for the token. Overall, ETH must maintain support above the $2,300 level. Additionally, the token needs to identify a bullish catalyst that could drive its price back above previously lost levels and target the next significant milestone at $3,000, a threshold that has not been reached since early August.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin’s Non-Realized Profits Hit Negative Levels—What Does This Mean for Investors?,2024-10-09 09:00:36+00:00,"As Bitcoin is currently still struggling to reclaim major highs, a recent analysis of its fundamentals has highlighted a possible buying opportunity for Bitcoin based on insights from the Non-Realized Profit metric. A CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost highlighted this metric’s importance in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, mentioning what its trend means for investors. According to the analyst, the Non-Realized Profit metric offers a window into the unrealized gains or losses held by Bitcoin investors, which can influence future market movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Not Sold On Uptober As Sentiment Remains Neutral Understanding The Current Zone In Non-Realized Profits The Non-Realized Profit metric is often used to calculate the difference between the current price of Bitcoin and the price at which each coin was last moved, without accounting for coins that have been sold. High values in this metric suggest that investors hold significant unrealized profits, which could lead to increased selling pressure as they may choose to realize these gains. Conversely, negative values indicate that many investors hold positions at a loss, potentially signaling a market bottom and a favourable entry point for new investors. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the Non-Realized Profit metric is mostly in the negative zone. This situation implies that many Bitcoin holders are either at break-even points or experiencing unrealized losses. Historically, such conditions have been associated with market bottoms, where the asset is considered undervalued. This scenario could present a strategic “opportunity” for investors looking to enter the market or increase their holdings. According to Darkfost, what sets the current market apart is that the unrealized profits have reached unprecedented highs compared to previous cycles, even while in the negative zone. This anomaly suggests that the ongoing market cycle may differ from past Bitcoin patterns. The analyst cautions that while this could lead to unique investment opportunities, it also introduces potential risks due to the deviation from established trends. Bitcoin Continuous Struggle Below $70,000 After briefly touching the $64,000 price level yesterday, Bitcoin has faced correction once again, falling back below this price mark—currently, the asset trades for $62,340, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. This decline in performance from Bitcoin appears to have also dragged the global crypto market cap along with it, with the overall market cap valuation of crypto currently down by 3.3% in the past day to $2.26 trillion. The plunge has had a severe impact on traders, most especially the ones on long positions. According to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 59,005 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidations sitting at $176.57 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 Out of the total liquidations, long positions account for $130 million, while short positions account for only $45.91 million.

Interestingly, the analyst suggested that the crypto could still reach a higher price target, calling the $44 price level “conservative.” XRP Price To Reach $44 Egrag Crypto predicted in an X post that the XRP price would reach $44. He highlighted this price level as one of the conservative targets based on the current cycle and the Fib Channel. The $44 price level is the target based on the Fib 0.702 channel. The other price targets he mentioned were $13 and $27, based on the Fib 0.5 and 0.618 channels, respectively.  Related Reading: Here’s Where We Are In The Bitcoin Bull Cycle According To The Wall Street Cheat Sheet The analyst is confident that the XRP price will hit these price targets. He claimed that since the crypto’s inception, the chart has indicated that the market can expect pumps to these Fibonacci Channel levels. Egrag Crypto also suggested that XRP will reach these price targets in this bull run, claiming that this is what the chart states.  Egrag’s label of these price targets as conservative also means that the XRP price could still rise higher in this bull run. The analyst didn’t provide any other price target, but other analysts like Javon Marks have predicted that the crypto could reach three digits. Marks recently predicted that XRP could rise to as high as $200.  The analyst stated that the crypto has broken out of a Pennant pattern of over six years. He claimed that hold of this break plus a Logarithmic Follow-Through after can send XRP to $200, representing a price gain of over 30,000%.  Marks expects the XRP price to reach $3.3 in the short term, close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.8. The analyst explained that since 2022, the crypto has confirmed multiple hidden bull divergences and is on course to achieve a bull breakout.  According to him, this bull breakout will lead to a price gain of over 450% as XRP reaches the $3.3 range. He added that this price breakout may only be a start, especially since he believes the crypto will still reach $200.  The Worst Case Scenario Amid these bullish predictions for the XRP price, Egrag Crypto has also revealed the worst scenario for the crypto in this market cycle. He claimed that XRP would at least reach between $2.3 and $5.89 in this bull run and outlined two reasons why he believes the crypto can at least reach these price targets no matter what.  Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year First, he noted that XRP managed to do a 10x from the bottom after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped the lawsuit in December 2020. He stated that XRP could easily hit the $5 to $ range if there is a similar situation after the SEC appeal. He added that the crypto might reach the Fib 1.618 level at around $6.5.  Secondly, he mentioned that the XRP price could hit $2.31 and $2,88 if the Bitcoin price reaches $80,000 and $100,000, respectively. He expects XRP to mirror BTC’s move, just like it did in the 2021 bull run.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

ADA is consolidating above $0.3400 and might attempt a recovery wave. ADA price started a downward move below the $0.3500 support level.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3460 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.3520 resistance zone. Cardano Price Consolidates Losses After testing the $0.3680 resistance, Cardano struggled to continue higher. ADA formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.3550 and $0.3500 support levels. The price even declined below $0.3450 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $0.3409 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.3450 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3681 swing high to the $0.3409 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.3520 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.3460 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3460 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.3520 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3681 swing high to the $0.3409 low. The next key resistance might be $0.3550. If there is a close above the $0.3550 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.3680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.400. More Downsides in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.3550 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3420 level. The next major support is near the $0.3400 level. A downside break below the $0.3400 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3250.

Bitcoin UTXO Supply In Loss Has Seen A Sharp Increase Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr talked about the recent trend in the Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Supply in Loss indicator. The “UTXO Supply in Loss” measures, as its name suggests, the total percentage of UTXOs in existence (or more simply, just the tokens) that are being held at some net unrealized loss. The indicator works by going through the on-chain history of each UTXO in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. Generally, the last transfer of any token represents the last point that it changed hands, so the price at its time can be assumed to be its cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Not Sold On Uptober As Sentiment Remains Neutral When this cost basis for any UTXO is greater than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then that particular UTXO can be assumed to be underwater right now. The UTXO Supply in Loss adds up all UTXOs satisfying this condition to find what percentage of the total supply that they make up for. Like this metric, there also exists the UTXO Supply in Profit, which naturally keeps track of the UTXOs of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin UTXO Supply in Loss over the history of the asset: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin UTXO Supply in Loss registered a sharp plunge to the zero mark (note that the chart is reversed as it uses a negative scale) when the cryptocurrency’s price set its all-time high (ATH) back in March of this year. Whenever BTC sets a new record, 100% of the investors get into profits, so the UTXO Supply in Loss shrinking down to zero is only natural. As the coin has witnessed bearish momentum in the last few months, though, the metric’s value has gone through an increase again. The 90-day moving average (MA) of the indicator, which is also listed in the chart, has now come close to the 20% mark. The CryptoQuant author has marked in the graph the previous instances of the metric making a similar retest of this level. “In previous cycles, similar conditions were sometimes followed by a price rally,” notes Axel. Thus, it’s possible that a price surge may follow for Bitcoin this time as well. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Be Preparing For Next Big Rally, Analyst Explains As for why the UTXO Supply in Loss going up can be bullish for Bitcoin, the reason is that the investors in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling, so whenever their number reduces, the chances of a selloff also go down. BTC Price Bitcoin had shown some recovery beyond the $64,000 level yesterday, but it would appear that the asset couldn’t maintain as it’s back at $62,500 now.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,XRP Price Coiling for a Leap: Can It Finally Break Through?,2024-10-09 04:08:06+00:00,"XRP price is stuck in a tiny range below the $0.550 level. The price must clear the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels to start a fresh increase. XRP price is still stuck in a range above the $0.5080 support. The price is now trading near $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5340 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5360 and $0.5450 resistance levels. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Surge XRP price remained supported above the $0.5080 support level. The price started a consolidation phase above the $0.5120 level, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a minor increase within a range and the price climbed above the $0.5250 resistance. There was a move above the $0.5320 level. However, the bears are active near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5453 swing high to the $0.5211 low. The price is now trading near $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.5340 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5340 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.5460 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5453 swing high to the $0.5211 low. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6000 resistance or even $0.6050 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5360 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5200 level. The next major support is near the $0.5165 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5165 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5050 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5000 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5200 and $0.5165. Major Resistance Levels – $0.5360 and $0.5450.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Analyst Dan Gambardello recently expressed a bullish prognosis, asserting that Cardano is now 10 times more robust than it was in previous cycles. The long-term prospects appear promising, however, the short-term market sentiment indicates that a cautious approach is preferable. Related Reading: Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months Gambardello said that the move to a fully decentralized, community-owned blockchain is one of the most important changes that makes him more optimistic. This important change happened after the Chang Upgrade went live on September 1. Gambardello said that the update has strengthened Cardano’s base, making it a more stable and independent network. However, this is only one part of the story. Cardano: 10x Stronger Than Last Cycle At This Moment. 🌐 Owned By Community ❌ IOG Burned Keys ⚡ Hydra Scaling 📈 Higher Market Cap Position 🤝 Massive Partnerships 🛡️ Unmatched L1 Security 💰 DeFi Ecosystem 🐻 Survived The Bear As Top 10 — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) October 6, 2024 Cardano’s Most Recent Advancements One of the major steps that Cardano took to signify its full shift into community administration was the termination of its genesis keys. Leading this milestone adds another level of security and decentralization to the blockchain, thanks to the efforts of Input Output Global (IOG). According to Gambardello, these elements make Cardano’s network far more robust than it was in earlier cycles. Furthermore, Cardano’s Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, extends the network’s appeal. Hydra’s objective is to enhance transaction throughput while simultaneously preserving high levels of security and decentralization. This solution could provide Cardano with a competitive advantage, particularly in its pursuit of dominating the competition with other top networks such as Ethereum, as scalability is a significant obstacle for many blockchains. ADA Market Position Cardano has also experienced a substantial increase in its market position. ADA rated 12th in the crypto market and had a market cap of $2.997 billion in 2020. At the time of writing, Cardano maintains a market capitalization of $12.64 billion. Despite recent underperformance, Cardano’s resilience during the 2022 and 2023 market decline has kept it in the top 10 for an extended period. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast Meanwhile, with technical indicators suggesting a cautious outlook for investors, Cardano (ADA) is presently in a bearish territory in the market. By November 7, 2024, the price of Cardano is expected to climb by 16.86%, according to CoinCodex, to over $0.412024. At 49, the Fear & Greed Index says traders are neutral even at this potential upward trajectory. The price volatility of Cardano had been at 5.70% with 60% positivity, boasting 18 out of 30 days in the green in the last 30 days. Based on these factors, many analysts believe that today isn’t probably the best time to make investments in Cardano. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,solana,My crypto were stolen from my phantom wallet. Please help,2024-10-08 19:33:21,"Good afternoon community

A couple of hours ago today I had 36000 Hammy tokens stolen from a phantom wallet. I never interacted with any malicious site or signed contracts from strangers. I also never opened any scam nft. So I can't understand how I was robbed and I am afraid that I will be emptied of more accounts from the same seed phrase. Although I already moved most of my funds to binance. I think it might have been through TG since 3 hours ago I decided to invest in the NOW token. Going to the Pumpfun website. I saw among the comments that someone posted the TG link of a supposed CTO of the coin, so I opened it to take a look.

[That is the comment](https://preview.redd.it/hmtmhpa81ltd1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=08a76a8615a422e5cbfc388505b275997a6567fc)

When I opened it, it asked me to do a verification like most TG groups, with the difference that in this one it asked me to scan a QR code, I was stupid and scanned it and I didn't get into any group, so I forgot about it. Half an hour later I started to check my wallets and saw that I was missing 36000 Hammy tokens and I feared the worst...so I checked my transaction history and realized that indeed they had been stolen.I couldn't explain it because as I explained before I always avoid misusing my wallet. So I guess it had to be because of the qr code I scanned from TG. When I checked the sessions I realized from telegram that I had an open session on a device in Paris, France (I am from Mexico). So I guess that's how they managed to steal my tokens, since the theft happened a few minutes after I foolishly scanned that QR code.

[This is the unknown session in telegram. Opened a few minutes before the robbery](https://preview.redd.it/ofvdbbbj3ltd1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5b615984c94348471949e0b73bbfd3e4d4f062)

[This is the transaction](https://preview.redd.it/678skqm33ltd1.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f0e058cc1c2b68383d41c6f597682fc80b5495)

 

I know it is impossible to recover the tokens. I just want to ask for help to know if the theft was as I believe it was done, or by some malicious software that slipped in without me realizing it. Right now I don't know whether to format my pc, delete my TG account. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

When you feel like everyone’s bags are pumping, and yours aren’t, it’s because:

1) You’re a low cap trader
You flip low caps all day. Most of the low cap coins are down bad the past couple of days. Also, if you’re doing this all thru Phantom or Solflare, you’re likely WAY too slow to make money on quick pump and dump low cap coins. You need to be using a bot (DM me for my ref link to the bot I use ;) )

2) You have no conviction bags
You don’t invest in long term holds / “cult” coins ie mini, manifest, tremp etc

What you should NOT do:

- chase green candles

Why the fuck would you chase mini at 30m when it was just at 12m mc - explain that to me

- dump ur current bags for the ones that are pumping

Just wait for a retrace

Anyway

Congrats if your bags are pumping

Wouldn’t it be possible to track which wallet someone is copy trading then find a way to buy the coin before the copy trader is buying so that you can sell it for more after the copy trader has bought? 

The way I would manage to buy before the copy trader is to have my own custom bot that is faster than the one many copy traders are buying on telegram. I would assume that because those telegram bots are built for the mass and not for only one person that they’re slower. 

I have knowledge in Rust which is one of the fastest programming languages. And I could write such a bot in Rust.
I doubt that the telegram copy trading bots are also using rust, as it’s way simpler to create a telegram bot with something like NodeJS or Python. 

I could find wallets that are being copy traded by just checking who bought the same coin a few seconds later. My goal would be to buy the same coin after the wallet that’s being copy traded but before the copy trader buys. Then once the copy trader buys I would instantly sell it, which should turn it into a profit. 

I have never bought any copy trading bot so if anyone of you has, it would be great if you could share some info with me.

Do you think this possible? ",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,solana,What is the viability of implement smart contracts in day to day operations?,2024-10-04 21:39:05,"Hi all! 

I am a developer and I am currently hyper focused on blockchain and crypto environment, specially on the matters of Smart Contracts. 

I am very interested in how I believe smart contracts could disrupt a lot of fields, so I started digging into the development aspect of it. However, one thing that really got me worrying, is the transaction cost of these nets. 

Even solana, with one of the lowest fees, the cost seems pretty unreasonable to develop anything at scale. 

I imagine that there are a lot of workarounds developers do to minimize costs, so I wanted to get your opinion on how viable are these costs in terms of development in scale and what are some of the ways people often use to minimize costa and structure a smart contract, and use it in real life applications.

I am also interested in use cases where companies uses these public nets, but abstracts the usage of blockchain, in a way that the user would not need to worry about creating wallets, managing keys and withdrawing money. So any insights on that matter are also welcome! 

Thank you!

Update: Just to make myself clearer, I do think that for use cases such as transferring money from accounts, or any other applications where each user has a wallet and it’s well informed about transaction costs and deal with them by themselves, the taxes are way lower than traditional transfer methods. However my main point is that most of the people do not want or do not care about having a wallet, and they are not informed at all about tramsaction fees and crypto buying. In these cases, to reduce barrier of entries, one might think of a solution where a third-party (the app, let’s say so) is responsible for abstrancting all these things, which means that the app itself will do the transactions internally. That’s where I think the cost rise up pretty quickly.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Here's more of the latest news for Solana devs...  


### 🏗️ Steel Framework

Steel is a new open-source framework developed by Regolith Labs (Ore) to simplify the development of programs on the Solana blockchain.

The framework originated out of a desire to streamline common tasks, reduce boilerplate code, and provide more efficient interfaces for Solana development.

Steel provides a collection of tools and helper functions to reduce the complexity of Solana program development by simplifying the handling of tasks like instruction parsing, cross-program invocations (CPIs), and account data validation.

It's a work in progress but already provides several tools aimed at improving the developer experience:

**Entrypoint Simplification:** Steel reduces the entrypoint boilerplate code by offering helper functions to parse instructions before dispatching to core logic, speeding up initial setup.

**Loaders for Account Data:** Steel includes loaders to parse and validate account data, which are expected to evolve to return mutable or readonly references to inner account data.

**Simplified CPIs:** Common CPIs such as creating token accounts, transferring, minting, and burning tokens are simplified, making interactions between programs easier and more efficient.

Features like initialization scripts, IDL generation, and a no-std-entrypoint for performance optimization are part of Steel's roadmap.

Steel encourages contributions from the Solana developer community to help it grow and evolve as more developers get involved.

### 🏙️ Jupiter Metropolis API

The Metropolis API Platform by Jupiter introduces a powerful set of liquidity tools designed to streamline access to liquidity on Solana.

The platform consists of three key APIs:

**Token API:** This API provides detailed token information, including enhanced token metadata and community-verified token tags. It serves as a reliable source of truth for developers and protocols, offering token data that users can trust when interacting with tokens.

**Price API (V2):** The second version of the Price API delivers enriched, real-time price data and historical swap information from Jupiter.

It includes features like Confidence Level, indicating the reliability of the price, especially useful for tokens with wide spreads, and Liquidity Depth, which shows available liquidity and potential price impacts on larger trades.

**Swap API:** Designed to facilitate seamless transactions, this API provides features such as Dynamic Slippage and Instant Routing. It helps developers access the best token swap prices and estimates priority fees for successful transaction completion.

Metropolis aims to simplify integration with Solana’s liquidity, empowering developers to build sustainable applications by providing real-time, accurate, and comprehensive liquidity data.

### 💳 Squads Card SDK

The Squads Card SDK leverages the programmability and security of Squads Protocol smart accounts, which power the self-custodial architecture behind [Fuse Pay](https://fusewallet.com/blog/fuse-pay?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a virtual Visa card that allows users to spend stablecoins in real-world transactions directly from their Fuse wallet.

When a user creates a card account, a separate smart account is deployed, with the main Fuse account acting as the signer. 

The SDK will allow other projects to easily integrate similar functionality, enabling them to launch card products on Solana with full user control, customizable spending limits, and time-locked withdrawals.

For developers, the Squads Card SDK opens up new opportunities to build card-based products that merge on-chain assets with everyday spending. 

Squads Protocol is actively seeking design partners to help shape the future of the Squads Card SDK. 

By participating in the design phase, developers can contribute to the SDK’s development, ensure it meets real-world needs, and take part in creating the next generation of Solana-based payment solutions.

Interested developers can reach out directly to the Squads team via DMs or participate in discussions on Solana developer forums.

### ⛓️ Wormhole Era3

**Wormhole Era3** brings upgrades to enhance cross-chain interoperability and improve UX, offering Solana developers new features to build on.

1. **Composable Intents**: Developers can chain multiple cross-chain actions into a single transaction, allowing for seamless asset swaps, DeFi operations, and other complex tasks across multiple blockchains, including Solana.
2. **Native Token Transfers (NTT)**: A new framework that eliminates liquidity fragmentation by preserving the native properties of tokens during transfers, meaning assets maintain their intrinsic qualities when moved across chains without needing to be wrapped. This ensures secure and fluid token movement for projects and financial institutions building on Solana.
3. **Enhanced SDKs**: The Wormhole TypeScript SDK has been revamped, making it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications with advanced UI/UX capabilities.
4. **Institutional Integrations**: Wormhole's new offerings cater to institutional needs, enabling Solana developers to build applications that align with capital markets and RWAs, as seen with partnerships like Securitize and integrations with Google Cloud and AMD.

These improvements in Era3 provide Solana developers tools for building multichain dApps while ensuring security and flexibility.

### 🔒 Hypernative on Solana

Solana projects now have access to Hypernative's platform, including a dedicated risk dashboard and incident response support to enhance security for Solana’s developer ecosystem.

Hypernative’s platform monitors a wide range of risks, including program vulnerabilities, phishing, scams, and market manipulations, offering real-time threat detection and response for both the network and projects building on it. 

Solana is now among more than 130 Web3 projects that utilize Hypernative's enterprise-grade platform, which monitors over $37 billion in digital assets across 40+ blockchains.

Developers building or managing funds on Solana can request a demo of Hypernative’s platform.

I'm experimenting with some trading strategies and I noticed that whenever I submit a transaction it takes somewhere close to 15-ish seconds. The fastest one I managed to see so far was 7 seconds. Is that expected? What are some best practices for performing fast transactions?

I know, sometimes the network gets congested but even when it's not this is still a problem. 

I tried using the public mainnet RPC as well as some free tier RPC nodes from Alchemy and Quiknode and the results are about the same. I also tried to increase the priority fee, which, imo, doesn't make much difference. 

I saw some traders performing sandwhiching, where they manage to pack 2 transactions into one block having a single transaction in between. Is that only possible with running a private RPC node or a Validator? ",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Then I sent $62.71 and she received $48. It was night time in the USA so I don’t think the gas rates were crazy. But it’s wild that I bought $116 worth and she only received $84.

Reddit,ethereum,Plans to reduce block rewards or raise the the burn rate?,2024-10-08 06:00:30,"Hey all,
Since blobs got introduced and regular users moved to L2s, there are way lower gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem. Time to celebrate, right?
The downside of this is a constantly increasing ETH supply and the fear, that ETH isn't seen as a good investment anymore. I know that inflation of Bitcoin is still higher rn but Bitcoins supply is capped, while ETHs is infinite.

Imo it is important for ETH to be seen as a store of value (besides all it's functionality) to attract new users. There is also the risk of the old users slowly fading away, because they feel this spiral of: less new users > more supply > falling price.

I am interested in the thoughts and discussions around this topic from the community, but especially the devs pov.

This is a follow-up to my post from about a month ago.

First, I want to clarify that I'm still bullish on Ethereum. I continue to dollar-cost average (DCA) into ETH, and I'm very close to setting up my own Ethereum node to help support the Ethereum blockchain.

My previous inquiry was about the number of developers building on the Ethereum platform. According to data from 2023, Ethereum is far ahead of other platforms in terms of developer activity, which is great news:

Read this: [https://www.developerreport.com/](https://www.developerreport.com/)

(Please let me know where I can find more up-to-date data for 2024). 

However, this leads me to a new question: While having numerous developers is positive, what tangible benefits will these developers bring to the ecosystem? In your opinion, what types of applications and use cases will they produce for the future of the project?

Reddit,ethereum,"When using Groth16 on Ethereum through ᴇɪᴘ‒197, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-05 21:22:04,"First remember Ethereum only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result… Otherwise I recognize this is more a mathematical problem but the place where I’m the most likely to find someone who do understand it remains on Ethereum as it’s partly cryptocurrency math specific.

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

Reddit,ethereum,I got hacked and stolen $45K off my wallet,2024-10-04 07:37:30,"I’m a video editor/programmer who with another guy online started to develop an editing tool that we were planning on selling. We had already started developing the tool and I knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online).

About 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and I downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (I know it’s dumb I don’t need to be lectured about it I know). That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money. I don’t know what I’m gonna do from there, I’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and I was supposed to go to University next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone. I’m really at a point where I want to give up on life.

-throwaway account, I’m truly ashamed of myself

EDIT: I will try to take legal actions but I really don't expect anything, as for the people saying I should have had a hardware wallet, I know. I also saw a lot of people claiming I was rich which is hilarious, I'm an immigrant from Senegal to Canada my parents are middle class workers (Accountant and Oceanographer) that struggled to give us good life opportunities so yes $45K is a lot of money. This is a part of the money I've invested being a video editor and held in ETH since 2-3 years, I'm not rich. Thank you for everyone sending me nice words of support, I needed that.

EDIT 2: I bought a Ledger wallet to stock the BTC I had on another hot wallet, I’m not making the same mistake again. I want to thank you guys again for the nice/wise words my brothers and sisters, it has helped cope a bit better with my situation although I still feel horrible about the whole thing. As for the ETH it’s gone, I don’t think I’ll ever see it again and although I still have a bit of money left, I’ll have to make it all over again but as some of you guys said I’ve done it once I can do it again and better.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/33gtnpdf7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=42da675ea3e71c74f71a7b294b547888e8219be3

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

🔗 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

Reddit,ethereum,Self custodial app that let business generate QR code of USDC payment,2024-09-20 09:21:03,"I saw the horrible user experience of Trump paying something with Bitcoin, and I start to think Ethereum definitely can do better. It should be just 2 seconds on L2 and 15 seconds on L1, cost $0.002 on L2 and $0.1 on L1.

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

Reddit,ethereum,Account Abstraction: Crypto Beyond Private Keys,2024-09-18 14:46:04,"Chances are, you have come across the term “account abstraction,” but you don’t know what it means. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

https://preview.redd.it/uliy7j98ykpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab67cd97bb20fc124f47e8b6b274325d3462423

Let’s dive into this fascinating topic and see how it can transform your understanding of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cryhfe1bxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c156583b63dfe1fa0fbb46ca88fe2e33573ec4

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

https://preview.redd.it/d6l81mocxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af084112a700012423b3838f16662eb37501dbcd

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cio8hwgfxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20a3703848b92783e55ea0dfd73e806dba78490

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/iegallxsxkpd1.png?width=2751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb0b8618ebf50cb583ad8fddacc7bedd411d7b3

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,On the Importance of Running a Bitcoin Core Node,2024-10-09 11:02:58,"There’s a popular saying in the Bitcoin space: “Every Bitcoiner should aim to run their own Bitcoin node.”

It sounds cool, right? But what does that really mean, and why is it so important? Let’s dive in and break it down.

To truly understand why every Bitcoiner should run their own node, we need to rewind to the very essence of what Bitcoin is.

At its core, Bitcoin is a decentralized and secure digital ledger, known as the “blockchain.” The blockchain is like a record book that keeps track of every single Bitcoin transaction since 2010.

Every 10 minutes, new transactions get added to this blockchain, ticking along like a perfectly timed watch.

Now, while Bitcoin is a lot more than just a ledger (there are miners, wallets, and all sorts of exciting tech behind it), at its heart, Bitcoin is really about **decentralization and security**.

Ans where is this ledger actually stored? You guessed it—**in the Bitcoin nodes.** Every Bitcoin node runs an exact replica of the blockchain. The more Bitcoin nodes there are, the more decentralized and secure the Bitcoin network becomes. In other words, **every node makes Bitcoin stronger.**

Now, you might be thinking: ""That sounds pretty important... but isn’t running a node super hard?""

Actually, **running a Bitcoin node is easier than you think!** Here’s why:

1. **You don’t need fancy hardware**: You can run a Bitcoin node on a simple computer or even a Raspberry Pi. If it can browse the web, it can probably run a node.
2. **No need to be a tech wizard**: There’s plenty of user-friendly software out there that guides you step-by-step. If you’ve ever installed an app, you’ve got this!
3. **It’s a hands-off process**: Once you’ve got your node set up, it runs quietly in the background, doing its thing while you live your life.
4. **You stay in control**: When you run a node, you’re verifying transactions directly from the source. You don’t have to trust anyone else’s copy of the blockchain. It’s like having VIP access to the Bitcoin ledger—no middlemen, no nonsense.
5. **Support the network**: Every node you run contributes to the overall health of the Bitcoin ecosystem. You’re actively helping to keep Bitcoin censorship-resistant, decentralized, and thriving for everyone. **You’re literally a part of Bitcoin’s backbone!**

And let’s not forget the bragging rights. Being able to say “I run my own Bitcoin node” is like telling people you built your own house, but in the digital world.

Running a Bitcoin core node isn’t just for hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts—it’s for anyone who cares about decentralization, privacy, and keeping Bitcoin true to its roots. Plus, it’s easier and more fun than you might think. So why not take the plunge and become a part of the Bitcoin revolution? You’ll be helping to secure the future of money, one block at a time.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,bitcoin,Are The Crypto Centralized Exchanges Running Dry of #bitcoin?,2024-10-09 06:09:48,"A historical decline in Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchange platforms is signaling a significant market shift. Glassnode data reveals reserves have plummeted to about 2.58 million BTC, a level unseen since 2018. This trend coincides with Bitcoin's price doubling this year, prompting questions about the rationale behind this movement.

Analysts speculate that investors are increasingly transferring their assets off exchanges to safeguard their crypto holdings instead of selling. This shift hints at a growing expectation of a substantial price upswing and a desire to protect against centralized platform volatility.

The ongoing outflows of Bitcoin from exchanges not only hint at a potential surge in demand but also underscore a broader transition towards off-exchange transactions. This shift reflects a changing mindset among Bitcoin holders, prioritizing autonomy and secure asset management in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.

Reddit,bitcoin,Norwegian company offers to pay part of salary in bitcoin,2024-10-09 08:08:13,"Original article in norwegian: [https://e24.no/teknologi/i/VzxbB4/utbetaler-daglig-loenn-i-bitcoin-hvorfor-faar-man-bare-loenn-en-gang-i-maaneden](https://e24.no/teknologi/i/VzxbB4/utbetaler-daglig-loenn-i-bitcoin-hvorfor-faar-man-bare-loenn-en-gang-i-maaneden)

  
Translated to english:



Pays daily wages in bitcoin: ""Why do we only get paid once a month?""



The developers wanted to test a new salary model. Now employees can choose to receive wages daily—in bitcoin. ""A tax risk,"" says a BI professor.



Salary models in Norwegian companies are relatively standardized today.



You do your job, and you get your salary deposited into your account once a month.



Now, the developers at the IT consulting company Snøkam are testing a new model they believe is fairer for employees.



“Why should you be paid for work you did three weeks ago?” asks senior consultant Simen Johnsrud.



The new model allows employees who wish to receive part of their monthly salary daily, in bitcoin, based on how many hours they worked that day.



Here’s how the arrangement works:



Employees can choose a percentage of their total monthly salary to be paid out daily throughout the month, instead of receiving the entire amount at the end of the month as usual.

The daily amount to be paid to the employees' accounts is converted into bitcoin before being sent.



“We asked ourselves: ‘Why do we only get paid once a month?’ and we couldn’t find any good answers—quite the opposite. It’s just always been that way, and it’s tailored to current routines,” says Johnsrud.



“One answer might be that running payroll has typically been a large manual process. We want to spend as little time as possible on manual tasks, so we’ve implemented automation wherever possible,” he adds.



Johnsrud provides an example to better explain the model.



“If an employee in the company earns 20,000 kroner a month, and there are 20 working days in the month, they will earn 1,000 kroner per day. If they choose to get 10% paid in bitcoin, that amounts to 100 kroner a day.”



Currently, seven out of eleven employees at the company have chosen to receive part of their salary in this way.



For now, Snøkam has set a maximum limit of 10% that can be paid out daily while testing the model. However, they aim to increase the limit over time.



The average percentage chosen so far is around 8%.



A bit ""unfair""



""But doesn't this just create a lot of hassle in accounting and more work than necessary for payroll?""



""As consultants, we work by the hour, so it’s very easy to see what our daily wage should be when we go home for the day. It’s also a bit 'unfair' for the employee that the company can withhold wages and earn money from it, as opposed to paying immediately for the work that’s been done. From that theory to payout in practice, the transition was not difficult for us,” says Johnsrud.



He explains that the daily amounts are automatically registered as an advance payment on the payslip.



At the end of the month, the advance payments are summed up and subtracted from the total amount.



“These amounts are deducted from what we calculate to be the employee’s exact monthly salary, so there are no errors, either in taxes or in the paid salary. The monthly reconciliation becomes the control for the entire system,” Johnsrud explains.



“So why pay out part of the salary in bitcoin?”



“Some of us are interested in crypto and wanted to explore the advantages of paying daily wages in bitcoin versus a regular payroll system,” he says.



Bitcoin is known for being a risky investment because its prices fluctuate greatly. As a result, many well-known investors and fund managers have warned against investing in cryptocurrency.



What do you and the other employees think about the volatility of bitcoin prices?



“As long as you can choose the risk you want to take by adjusting the daily rate, it’s easier to accept a fluctuating rate,” Johnsrud says.



“It’s completely voluntary for employees to participate in the bitcoin arrangement or not. We also understand the issue with paying 100% of wages in bitcoin, since it can’t be used everywhere. So, it’s good that you can choose how much you want to commit,” he adds.



A tax risk



Espen Ekberg is a professor of economic history at BI Norwegian Business School.



“This is interesting, and they are free to create the payroll system they want, but it’s strange that the company wants to pay wages in bitcoin. A common definition of salary is that the employee receives compensation in money, and bitcoin cannot be considered money. It could become that, but it doesn’t have this function today,” he says.



“Money should be used as a medium of exchange and must hold value well. The basic premise of a salary is that your labor should be worth a certain amount of purchasing power, and it shouldn’t depreciate too much over time,” he says.



Ekberg also points to a tax risk for employees who opt into the scheme:



“Those who have agreed to this will never know exactly how much bitcoin they will receive each week. But they still have to pay taxes based on their salary in kroner. If you have a salary of 800,000 kroner, and 10% is paid in bitcoin, you still have to pay taxes based on the 800,000 kroner. Therefore, there’s a clear risk if the bitcoin rate fluctuates significantly,” he says.



“Some people like risk and enjoy playing with it, but I don’t quite understand the reason for trying this. It’s very strange,” Ekberg adds.



He also notes that salary hasn’t always been paid monthly.



“You don’t have to go far to find completely different systems. In the U.S., for example, bi-weekly payments are quite normal. In Norway, we’ve also had different salary systems. Monthly payments became common when banks started offering salary accounts in the 1960s. Before that, wages were often paid weekly, in cash,” the professor adds.



“So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin”



Aksel Øvern is the CEO of Snøkam and also works as a consultant.



“Would it have been possible to do this with regular Norwegian kroner? That is, pay salaries as normal, but daily instead of monthly?”



“Payments in Norwegian kroner have some limitations since they go through the traditional banking system. First and foremost, these transactions require signing with BankID in our accounting system, which would have made this solution practically impossible. Our finance manager would have had to sign every single daily transaction for every employee with BankID,” Øvern responds.



“The traditional banking system would also have significantly limited this solution due to long transaction times, depending on the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays. The transactions we do today with bitcoin are received within a minute after the consultant logs their hours. This works regardless of the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays,” Øvern continues.



Now, he and Johnsrud hope that the arrangement will catch on, and that more restaurants and shops in the capital will begin to accept the volatile cryptocurrency as a means of payment.



“What each employee does with their bitcoins once they’re in their account will be interesting. We believe, and hope, that the adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrency over time will allow us to use these currencies for daily expenses in Norway. So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin. Fortunately, it’s located right by our office at Nationaltheatret,” says Øvern.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

	1.	Peter Todd’s timeline: Todd got involved in the Bitcoin community around 2011, which is after Satoshi had already disappeared (Satoshi stopped being active in 2010). Todd himself has confirmed this timeline and never claimed to be involved in creating Bitcoin.
	2.	Different communication styles: Satoshi’s writing style and approach to Bitcoin’s design is different from Todd’s. Satoshi was really focused on decentralization, while Todd has been more involved in discussions about improving Bitcoin’s privacy and scalability, but from a more pragmatic standpoint.
	3.	Public statements: Todd has always denied being Satoshi and said that it wouldn’t make sense for him to hide his identity if he was, considering how open he’s been in the Bitcoin world.
	4.	Technical focus: While both are skilled in cryptography, Todd’s work has mainly focused on specific improvements to Bitcoin, like time-stamping services and fixing transaction malleability, rather than creating the network itself.

These factors, along with what Todd has said himself, makes it clear he isn’t Satoshi Nakamoto.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

When I clicked it, the app told there were unspent bitcoin that were on standby, because I took too long to use it. So I transferred the 300000 and discovered later that the unspent were 380000 sats.

Reddit,bitcoin,How much bitcoin to be in the 0.1% in the world?,2024-10-09 05:27:02,"TLDR; According to GPT O1, assuming a Gaussian distribution, you need 0.0105 BTC to be in the top 0.1%. However, if we add other ""more realistic"" assumptions on distribution, you need 10 BTC to be in the top 0.1%

-----Details below-----

To determine how much Bitcoin you need to hold to be in the top 0.1%, 1%, and 10% of Bitcoin holders globally, we can model the distribution of Bitcoin holdings using a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on the given assumptions:

# Assumptions

* **Total Bitcoin Supply:** 21,000,000 BTC
* **World Population:** 8,000,000,000 people
* **Distribution Model:** Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

# Calculating the Mean Holding

First, calculate the average (mean) Bitcoin holding per person:

Mean(μ)=Total Bitcoin/World Population=0.002625 BTC per person

# Determining the Standard Deviation

In a Gaussian distribution, the mean and standard deviation (σ) define the spread of the data. However, the total Bitcoin supply constrains the distribution. For simplicity, we'll assume that the standard deviation is equal to the mean:σ=μ=0.002625 BTC*σ*=*μ*=0.002625 BTC *Note: This is a simplification. In reality, Bitcoin holdings are likely more skewed, but for the purpose of this calculation, we proceed with this assumption.*

# Calculating Bitcoin Holdings for Top Percentiles

Using the properties of the normal distribution, we can determine the Bitcoin holdings required to be in the top 0.1%, 1%, and 10%.

# Top 0.1%

* **Z-score for 99.9th Percentile:** ≈ 3.09
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(3.09×0.002625)≈0.0105 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(3.09×0.002625)≈0.0105 BTC

# Top 1%

* **Z-score for 99th Percentile:** ≈ 2.326
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(2.326×0.002625)≈0.0087 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(2.326×0.002625)≈0.0087 BTC

# Top 10%

* **Z-score for 90th Percentile:** ≈ 1.282
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(1.282×0.002625)≈0.00599 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(1.282×0.002625)≈0.00599 BTC

# Summary of Required Bitcoin Holdings

|**Top Percentile**|**Z-score**|**Bitcoin Needed**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Top 0.1%|3.09|≈ 0.0105 BTC|
|Top 1%|2.326|≈ 0.0087 BTC|
|Top 10%|1.282|≈ 0.0060 BTC|

# Conclusion

Under the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of Bitcoin holdings across the global population:

* **To be in the top 0.1%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0105 BTC**.
* **To be in the top 1%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0087 BTC**.
* **To be in the top 10%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0060 BTC**.

# A more realistic model:

Given the skewed distribution, the Bitcoin needed to be in specific percentiles increases significantly compared to the Gaussian model.

* **Top 0.1%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 10 BTC
* **Top 1%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 1.133 BTC
* **Top 10%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 0.1 BTC",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,bitcoin,"Why we might still need inflationary Currencies, even after the Bitcoin standard?!",2024-10-07 17:57:14,"To preface, I believe in BTC as the hardest money and look forward to being on a BTC standard. But I had this, lets say food for thought!

This chain of thought started when I saw a YouTube comment asking how will a new grad get/payback a loan to buy a house if BTC is getting more expensive with time. 

My instant reaction was that one can save from his labor and buy in a few yrs without a loan, and the house would also get cheaper in btc terms each year. This may be true, but it doesn't always work, as there are legit reasons for getting loans like starting a business, higher education etc. 

So then I thought a bit more and it made it think that maybe the best case scenario would be to only have incomes (earned MONEY against which work/value has already been delivered aka proof of real work) being in BTC. 

Everything else aka credit (ie. CURRENCY - the value/work is yet to be delivered) in USD(T) , which can be inflated aka credit creation via loan, to start a new business, buy a house, higher education etc etc. 
These currencies should be directly pegged to BTC by a simple total currency / total btc ratio, so BTC essentially absorbs all inflation and evenly distributes it amongst holders.

This way, BTC savings/holders never lose any purchasing power via inflation, but at the same time we have enough currency/liquidity for the economy to function (by being able to start new business, buy house, higher education etc) 

BTC holders would sell their MONEY ie. BTC and convert to any of the currencies, whenever they either want to consume or invest into anything. 

This way labor never gets devalued, but instead your labor aka your BTC income (and thus BTC savings) will capture all the economic growth with time, by adjusting with the currency inflation.

IMO, the problem with only having BTC as money is the possibility of Hoarding. At a point the large holders/hoarders may never want to risk their BTC (since they can just capture the market growth anyway so why risk it?). Even if these large hoaders spend lavishly, that won't be enough for somebody wanting to start a business, higher education, buy a house etc) 

At that point, if BTC if the only medium of exchange aka BTC standard, it's price or borrowing yield will become too much for anybody to risk/willingly borrow and start a business. This would then most likely kill innovation, which is never good. 

We also need those currencies as direct BTC based loans don't make a lot of sense, if getting your hands on BTC is becoming harder and harder with time. Almost nobody would able to payback, unless you manage to grow more than the market (aka BTC price appreciation against real goods/services) + the interest yield. 

People can instead borrow any of the currencies to start a businesses, buy BTC instantly, since they need to pay incomes in btc, and they also start capturing the market growth /inflation via BTC as soon as possible. 
The people / business can then convert back to any currency at the time of buying / investing into anything (except for labor, which will be paid in BTC directly). 
This way until the business uses their BTC, they keep getting the market growth via BTC price appreciation (against currencies / real goods). This would help paying down (at least a part of) the currency debt/interest. 
This makes sense, as it essentially means the economy / market is producing enough to subsidize all business loans /risk taking (to a certain extent), which would breed innovation instead. 

This way the entire society including both individuals and businesses get the benefit of the overall productivity, rather than only the people close to the printers or high executives who decide their own salary / bonuses. 
But at the same time, we wouldn't risk bringing economy to an halt and stifling innovation /sensible risk taking, due to hoarding scenarios. 

Open to thoughts / finding loop holes in this theory!

PS:
There is also a psychological change that happens with hard money, where people tend to hoard and not want to spend. The fiat currencies going up will again give them an illusion of wealth, basically how stocks and real state work, and stimulate the economy.

Reddit,bitcoin,Guidance on taking profits,2024-10-07 12:15:08,"Hi,

I don’t have a lot of savings overall, but some of what I have is in BTC and has gotten to a point I would like to potentially take a little out to handle some expenses. 

I’m in the US and mostly purchased via Coinbase, but also have Gemini and Binance US accounts as there were a couple alts at the time I foolishly chased that were not available on CB.

My funds are on hardware wallets now. If I wanted to take a little out next bull run to handle some life expenses- what is the best approach to pay what I need in fees and taxes to stay legal but not more.  If I transfer it back to Coinbase they have fees to convert BTC back to fiat, then pay capital gains tax using FIFO is that all their is to it?

I’ve been using Cointracker and Koinly but neither are 100% accurate as when I was younger and goofing around when I was like 16-17 I bought a bunch of alts that went nowhere, got scammed a few times along the way, lost money in Celsius and BlockFi that each paid back via PayPal, bought a couple small things online with BTC just to see if I could, did a little mining from my laptop, straight up screwed up and lost BTC while learning how it all works— essentially a big mess.  Past couple years I used those apps to kinda guesstimate what to pay in taxes but know they are not 100%.  It was under the idea of “just do your best to figure it out and pay something” to keep the IRS from putting a microscope on you. 

So I am trying to pay due tax when I take a little out, and figured worse case scenario I should do fifo from here out just in case and pay max tax so if ever audited I won’t someday get spanked with a big past due tax bill of in trouble of any kind tax wise.  That said, I got a smidge early like 2017 when I was just a kid experimenting and it’s worth a decent amount more now and paying tax on that gain kinda sucks so just want to make sure I’m not missing the boat and doing this foolishly in a way that I’m leaving too much $ on the table.  

What is the lower cost legal way to DCA out a smidge here and there along the way?  Or is my plan to transfer back to Coinbase and just pay the tax on the gains based on what koinly says ok despite it not being 100% accurate?

If the IRS ever wants to audit me I’d like to be in a position to say I did everything I could to pay what I thought was right and not be screwed.  Not looking to be a target.

Thanks all

Reddit,bitcoin,The Gravity of Bitcoin: Unstoppable and Unbanable,2024-10-06 18:43:19,"In the crypto space, losing money is the price of tuition. I played with leverage and lost money on speculative assets. Many people, including myself, come to make money. Some gamble and strike it big, but most eventually lose everything. Those who avoid ending up broken and bitter are the ones who research projects, build convictions around them, and become community builders and utility creators. Alternatively (quite often additionally), they genuinely understand Bitcoin.


The key difference between Bitcoin and other cryptos is that most projects are companies, whereas Bitcoin is a protocol. If something negative happens to Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, their respective company’s stocks will plummet. Bitcoin, however, has no such vulnerability. The inventor has disappeared. 


“Satoshi created a way, gave it away, and walked away”

-Michael Saylor 


There is no figurehead to target, no single person to sanction or slander. It's akin to attacking gravity – impossible. You can't ban Bitcoin; you can only ban yourself from it. Gravity doesn't require trust because it's a fundamental protocol of nature. When you drop something, its weight is verified. Similarly, Bitcoin's value is verifiable, making trust unnecessary. 

Bitcoin invites us to look beyond speculation and build conviction on its unshakeable foundation. The gravity of truth holds: verifiable, trustless, and unassailable. Rise above the noise and trust the protocol.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Live (free) crypto rates for Google Sheets and Excel, now with API access for any app",2024-10-09 11:53:25,"Nearly 3 years ago [I made a free tool](https://cryptorates.ai/) for r\/cryptocurrency to get live crypto rates into Google Sheets and Excel, without needing to use Javascript and without any rate limits.

This service is still going strong and I've made some big improvements recently:

- Includes the data for the top 5000 coins by 24-hour volume.
- Prices are now updated every 5 minutes.
- I have [added API access](https://cryptorates.ai/api/docs) so you can use this in any application; it doesn't need to be only in Google Sheets / Excel.
- All-time high and low have been added to the dataset along with some other useful columns.
- **And most importantly: no rate limits!** You can fetch from this service as much as you like. I make heavy use of Cloudflare's free caching functionality, so the load on my server is very minimal. Cloudflare does the heavy lifting for me.

To get any rate into Google Sheets is as simple as copying and pasting this formula; for example to get the rate of PancakeSwap:

    =QUERY(IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/files/standard.csv"", 
    "","", ""en_US""), ""SELECT Col3 WHERE Col1 = 'CAKE'"", 0)

Just change `CAKE` to the coin of your choice or use a cell reference. 

If you want you can reference the rate directly, however this will result in your sheet being slower if you're wanting to track more than one rate: `=IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/v1/price/BTC"")`

You can see in this animation how once you've fetched the rate for one coin, all the other coins will have their rate instantly appear without any *""Loading…""* text:

[Adding multiple rates animation](https://cryptorates.ai/get-rates-loop.webp)

These of course can be converted to any currency; for example to get PancakeSwap in Euro (EUR):

    =QUERY(IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/files/standard.csv"", "","", ""en_US""), 
    ""SELECT Col3 WHERE Col1 = 'BTC'"", 0) * GOOGLEFINANCE(""USDEUR"")

If you want to track the rates of a lot of coins, it's best to use [the VLOOKUP method](https://cryptorates.ai/vlookup-method) to make things even faster.

I have also done a lot of work on the documentation, so please let me know if anything is unclear or you get stuck anywhere. Docs are here: https://cryptorates.ai/

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Tibia, one of the oldest MMORPGs in the world, will allow players to trade in-game gold for crypto",2024-10-09 10:05:32,"CipSoft, the developer of the classic MMORPG Tibia, has announced an upcoming feature that introduces Tibia Tokens (TIB), a new digital token for trading in-game currency. **Tibia, launched in 1997, is one of the longest-running online multiplayer games.**

Tibia Tokens (TIB) can be obtained by converting Tibia Coins, an in-game currency, through the Tibia Token Exchange. **Built on the BNB Smart Chain and following the ERC20 standard**, Tibia Tokens are compatible with many digital wallets, like MetaMask and applications. This feature opens up a unique opportunity for Tibia players to engage with blockchain technology, blending the lines between virtual and real-world economies. 

While Tibia may not have the massive player count of games like World of Warcraft, it has maintained a dedicated player base with around 10,000 to 20,000 daily active players. Therefore, this might indicate an important step for the gaming and cryptocurrency industries, showing the potential of game economies to integrate with digital asset platforms.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Unmasking NFT Wash Trading,2024-10-08 20:50:49,"Dear community,

We're a team of researchers interested in infometrics, chainalysis, or colloquially analysis of blockchain data. I've made this account to post about our recent research on analysis of NFT trading networks and our findings in detecting potential illicit activity in NFT trading networks.  
This post is primarily aimed at providing educational material regarding NFT's and the authors are not blaming any particular NFT, creator, or project.

Traditional financial markets enjoy a significant presence of regulators enforcing a sea of illegal activity. However, most enforcing is trivial as user information is disclosed to regulating bodies linking each account to a real identity. Algorithms for detecting such patterns are not directly applicable to decentralized markets where only a pseudonymous identity is available. In other words, a user can have many wallets, and unless a centralized KYC platform is used, linking wallets to users is difficult. Prior research concentrated on examining NFT trading graphs to find recurring patterns that would indicate illegal activity. However, the ability to create wallets at fiat makes these efforts inadequate.

Our method takes a different approach. Here's how we did it.

# Our Approach: Linkability Network

The core of our method lies in the integration of **NFT trading graphs** with the entire **Ethereum Transaction Network**, creating a **Linkability Network**. Here’s how it works:

* **NFT Ownership Traces**: We track the historical transfers of ownership for each NFT, capturing every instance of trading or transfer.
* **Ethereum Transaction Network**: We extract and map the entire transaction history of Ethereum accounts involved in NFT trading, focusing on direct transfers of ETH between accounts.

The result is a directed graph that highlights potential collaborations or shared ownership across wallets that engage in wash trading. These connections, revealed through normal Ether transactions, indicate a high likelihood of coordination between wallets, even if no direct NFT trade is observed.

As commonly said, a picture tells a thousand words.

https://preview.redd.it/2ak5wznkhltd1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9555a299e406754f015e8bb8f516f40ac4b3091

The images above are examples of NFT trading graphs that our algorithm computes. The trades where the NFT was sold are edges colored red; the green edges are transfers between two accounts, and finally, the purple dotted lines are accounts historically linked on the Ethereum network. The proposition is simple: two or more accounts buying/selling/transferring the same NFT between them while having had transactions between in ETH is hardly a coincidence.

This usually happens when two or more wallets owned by the same entity/person continuously buy the same token from one-another. However, they can only do this if they have enough liquidity, or they send the ETH back and forth to fund the next buy.

The left graph shows how the first 9 accounts are all interlinked on the Ethereum transfers. These wallets were all participating in trading the token, resulting in a significant price increase. Finally, the last 3 trades are likely honest buyers that speculated on the continuation of the price action and are now holding the token, to this day, unable to sell due to lack of buyers.

Similarly, the graph on the right illustrates the same pattern amplified both in terms of value as well as trades.

The likability network was computed by following all transactions of each participating wallet until depth 4. This took a lot of time and significant computation power. For those interested, the [data of cca. 135k NFT's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/03370b71c433bfddf931292adbee759704774fa4b414174b14e3ff8946213d8b) and their graphs is publicly available, as is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16603) that goes into more detail.

In conclusion, it is unfortunate that many of the market participants were unaware about these practices. Hopefully, this post will help raise awareness about these practices for those of you trading NFT's.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

I feel like an idiot for not seeing the red flags early on before depositing $25,000 into their exchange. 

There is no information available about them on the internet currently and I'm hoping that this post will deter at least one person in the future from making the same mistake as me. 

After testing a few small withdrawals I deposited a larger amount into their platform. Once the time came to withdraw my funds in full they accused me of insider trading and blocked withdrawals on my account. 

I became suspicious and started researching them more thoroughly, turned out the awards on their website are fake, the company doesn't actually seem to be registered anywhere and the physical address on their website doesn't actually house their businesss.

They then said that I need to pay an ""insurance fee"" of 25% of the current account balance in order to unfreeze my account, which I did. Then they came to me again and said there was an issue with identifying the wallet which the deposit came from so I need to do it again. 

At this point I'm cutting my losses. A very bitter pill to swallow of course but I've learnt an important lesson in only using trusted and verified platforms for trading. I feel like an absolute idiot right now.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What happens when all the bitcoin available is owned?,2024-10-09 07:34:17,"From what I just understood, new bitcoins will be completely unavailable to obtain after 2040. If there is a finite amount that is known to be possibly owned and it all can be accounted for, and it can be publicly known who holds “x” amount, does that eliminate the illusion of power forever across the world’s governments?


Does the amount to be “known” to be owned by Satoshi create an illusion that the market can be saturated at any time and the world turned upside down at a moments notice, thus preventing future Cold War-like peacocking-confrontations based off “current” knowledge of the market availability of the currency?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Is there a discount for blacklisted crypto, similar to counterfeit currencies?",2024-10-08 13:19:34,"It seems to be an increasing problem for folks who come into possession of crypto from outside the walled garden of CEXs who try to bring them inside the wall: the crypto has been sprinkled with the dust of ""illicit"" crypto, i.e. it's been mixed with the proceeds from some sort of criminal activity and has been traced through blockchain analysis.

The CEX is then likely to either freeze and eventually seize it, along with the rest of the clean crypto in the same wallet.  Naturally with blacklists changing by the minute, this is a risk for any transaction entering the walled garden.

This is a little bit similar to counterfeight currency, where the black market usually discounts it from 50-80%, because it causes a risk of being seized at the point of sale or transfer (At retail, perhaps just the loss of a large bill or two, at a wholesale drug deal, the risk of loss could probably include ones good health or life as well)

So, I'm curious...is there a similar risk discount to blacklisted crypto, as it likely needs to stay outside of the walled garden, and is harder to turn into useful cash, or is it so mixable that it's not really a problem after all?  If so, what does it run?",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,India’s Stand On Crypto | A Year After the G20 Presidency,2024-10-08 14:21:45,"Disclaimer: Does this look like financial advice? You are right. It isn’t. Treat it so.

“Do Your Own Research” (DYOR) is not a fad but an important element of the cryptoverse. Do keep that in mind.

# India, Crypto, and the G20 Presidency

India was the first country in the G20 to call for regulation of the crypto economy, during its G20 Presidency. The idea was to bring together the top 20 economies of the world on the same page regarding regulation. That move augured well for the crypto enthusiasts in India as it was seen as the government leaning towards and accepting crypto as one of the realities of the economy.

https://preview.redd.it/xom3vysrijtd1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=637ac4a49e5bc191bf591996ada09794c0305f6c

While India did ban crypto in 2018 until it was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in 2020, there were no such steps taken thereafter. The closest India came to a ban was when International exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and seven others were banned from operating in India unless they registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). 

So, what is the state of crypto now?

https://preview.redd.it/jlu0w3kghjtd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fefbb55c5bed8125b38d778be8f51a240b8f55e

# Crypto in India | 2024 | And Forward

Nearly a year after the completion of India’s G20 Presidency, India seems to be committed to crypto regulations. The banning of the International Crypto Exchanges was seen as a step towards regulating crypto operations. Since the ban, Binance, KuCoin, and four other exchanges have already registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and started operations in India. The others will follow suit as well.

Not only is India committed to regulating crypto for its citizens, but it stays committed to the larger framework of crypto regulations across countries. To jog our memory, it was India during its G20 Presidency that worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – Financial Stability Board (IMF-FSB) to present a framework for crypto regulations across borders. This paper is still evolving and most of the framework was to be finalized by 2025. Thereafter, it is like a plug-and-play. Interested countries could join in and bring themselves under the global crypto regulatory environment.

So, all’s rosy then?

https://preview.redd.it/2l5f4uhlhjtd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4991cb3d0f456418ad74e8818be76aeba9e585

# Rosy and Cozy for Crypto? | Yes, but Not As Much

At least, the worry that crypto could be banned in India is a thing of the past. Now, the discussions revolve around regulation, taxation, lowering taxes, allowing more participants to join the crypto economy, and the like. Therefore, as a crypto player, it is indeed a heartening site.

Also, the regulatory framework gives a sense of confidence to crypto users. After all, it was just a couple of months ago that WazirX, one of India’s crypto exchanges was hacked and set back by roughly $240 million. WazirX is yet to open operations. That’s what could go wrong and this is why we need regulation in the crypto economy.

While users may be unhappy momentarily because of the taxes and also the regulatory framework they have to adhere to, over the longer term, this will only benefit them. So, all is good. And will remain good.

Rosy and cozy, therefore? Just about there! 😊

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,A custom coded always-on crypto price display,2024-10-08 06:40:03,"I created a script that displays the real-time price of any coin. The purpose of this is pretty simple - I can always see the price of Bitcoin, Eth, Ton, and others. (Works with pretty much any coin since it pulls in real-time prices from OKX).

It’s been pretty handy for me so far, but now I’m thinking of upgrading it a bit.

Maybe you have some feedback or better ideas? My ideas right now are:

1. I could upgrade the script so it can track the balance of the user's wallet. This could be easier to understand than the price of a coin.
2. I think it’d be awesome if the script could also display NFTs held in a wallet.
3. Displaying the price chart of a coin.

I know it's basic stuff – this was just a random weekend project. But what do you think of this idea?

Also what’s your take on OKX? Is it good enough for price tracking and calculations? I like that their API is free, unlike Coinbase, CoinGecko, and CoinMarketCap, which need a subscription.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Are Airdrops Actually This Easy?,2024-10-07 23:20:11,"I’m a complete newcomer to the world of cryptocurrency, so I hope you’ll go easy on me! The concept I’ve come across seems almost too good to be true. I recently signed up for Zealy and connected my MetaMask wallet, eager to get started. From what I’ve gathered, the process seems relatively straightforward: I join various projects, share some posts on Twitter, and join in on a few Discord servers. Ultimately, the promise is that these projects will send crypto directly to my wallet as I participate. 

Is that really how it works? Am I just dreaming, or is there some hidden catch I need to worry about? It certainly sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I can’t shake the feeling that there might be more to it than just signing up and sharing posts. If this is a legitimate way to earn some crypto, I can’t help but wonder why it seems like every man and his dog isn’t jumping on board too. 

Could it be that the returns are just so minimal that it’s not worth the time and energy? Or perhaps experienced users are aware of other factors that I’m currently oblivious to? It's also possible that there are risks involved that aren't immediately apparent to a beginner like myself. I’m looking for clarity because I genuinely want to understand how to navigate this space safely and avoid falling into any traps. If anyone has insights, tips, or firsthand experiences to share regarding crypto airdrops and the Zealy platform, I would greatly appreciate it.

My friend asked if they could pay him through ACH, PayPal, or cash, but they said they could only pay in Bitcoin. However, my friend mentioned that they are ready to pay him, but it has to be in Bitcoin. Otherwise, they said they would need to send the money via Western Union to a family member in the United States first and then to my friend again using Western Union. Technically, two years ago, Panama allowed Bitcoin payments. However, I'm concerned that this might be a scam. 

If he decides to accept a Bitcoin payment for now, which platform should he use?

Also, please let me know if this is a scam and advise on what my friend should do. It would sadden me to think that a company would attempt to take advantage of a young employee. Thank you again!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"As a prolofic Alt Investor, This Is My Greatest Argument Against Alts.",2024-10-08 07:57:29,"If you check my history, you’ll rarely find a post from me that’s entirely pro-BTC. So please don’t assume that this is one. Why am I saying this? Because I cannot make my point without referring to BTC. And, while this may come across as pro-BTC, my actual goal is to argue against alternative cryptocurrencies (alts). If my criticism of alts seems to favor BTC, it’s simply because the weaknesses of alts highlight the relative strengths of BTC. And I cannot make my argument without it.

Now, let’s get into it: Alternative cryptocurrencies are a poor investment as long as BTC and fiat currencies exist—especially BTC.

**Why?**

1. **Alts are tethered to BTC and fiat.** Most altcoins are heavily influenced by the price of BTC. If BTC rises, many alts follow, and if BTC falls, alts usually fall even harder. For example, during the 2022 crypto crash, BTC’s drop wiped out not just a lot of its own market value crashing to about $15,000 from almost $70,000 but altcoin market as well. Now you might say everything crashed. Yes. But ALTs dropped more than BTC did. BTC dropped by 70-75%ish. Alts? 95% or more. 

2. **Alts track BTC’s volatility.** If BTC takes a nosedive, altcoins typically experience an even steeper decline. This was evident in the 2018 bear market, where BTC dropped by 85%, but many alts, like Ethereum, lost over 90% of their value. Ethereum did nothing wrong. It is home to thousands of alts that still operate on it and the staging ground for many that moved to their own network later on. Yet, it suffered a crash not because it did anything wrong, but because it was pegged to BTC.

3. **Dumping for fiat can tank alts.** Let's say BTC crashes 10% causing a -10% in the price of your alt even if no one sells. Then when people start selling to fiat, it crashes further. 

4. **Many alts are centralized with a ""CEO.""** Do you remember when the founder of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, sold off his entire LTC holdings, the market reacted negatively, sending the price into freefall, even though the project itself hadn’t changed. It was trading at almost $400 USD....400. FOUR HUNDRED. Today? sub-70 USD.

So, why bother investing in alts? I’m not saying you should put your money into BTC either, but BTC doesn’t suffer from the same vulnerabilities that altcoins do. If you believe in the ecosystem and think that certain altcoins solve real-world problems, then sure, invest in any alt that you want. But if you care about the price... So, it literally feels like the success of most alts depends on BTC’s performance and the faith of holders not to sell. While BTC only depends on the faith in people not to sell.

It is like fighting a war on two fronts with alts. Actually, more like 2+ whatever else that the alt garners, from public opinion, liquidity, etc. 

------

**So, if you are going to respond, please answer this question:** Given the reasons I have given (and not given because I do not want to make this very long) on why alts suffer when it comes to price-action, why bother investing in alts at all?

At the end there is a picture mentioning Dave Kleiman. Director (Cullen Hoback) matches up and the first Producer (Adam McKay) also matches up. Could they have proof that Dave Kleiman was Satoshi? He is currently listed at 3.5% chance on Polymarket. I don't know but something about this looks real and I think the closing credit font was the same block characters I saw on the trailer. If it is true, it kind of makes sense why Craig Wright was so adamant in trying to get credit if he knew with absolute certainty who Satoshi was and that he had passed.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Binance - excessive facial recogntion requirement to login every time. Please stop it!,2024-10-06 17:45:30,"Would have posted in /r/binance but they made that sub private (great decision, sends all the right messages about Binance ...)

Lately Binance requests an automated Facial recognition as part of every login, at least in my case -- a Passkey as 2fa is no longer sufficient, it always wants at least 2 or 3 forms of 2fa and one of them is an automated Facial recognition, and it's mandatory.

If anyone from Binance sees this: please stop this nonsense! It keeps me out ... a person can grow facial fair, have swollen parts of the face from a disease, or from aggression, etc ... a host of valid reasons why a facial recognition no longer matches via automated matching!

I really hope otrher exchanges don't start with this nonsense too ... what's next? send over blood samples for DNA matching?

Edits:

1: To people who claim it's geo related: It never required facial recognition until a few weeks ago. My IP or location didn't change. My device hasn't changed (mobile). Apparently this facial recognition has started rolling out only a couple of months back.

2: To people claiming many banks and exchanges use facial recognition **for login**: which ones exactly? I've never seen or heard of any, apart from Binance. We're talking login, not KYC.

3: To people claiming facial changes aren't an issue becasue ""these systems are well designed"": clearly you haven't been hit by it, so why do you even reply?

4: To people claiming I must have done shady stuff: you guys never cease to get a kick out of acting mean, take it elsewhere.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The trusted setup publishes

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations?

2)    if indeed it can technically be called 'random', does this fact negate the potential claim that such data is 'encrypted', on the general assumption that the concept of random data is mutually exclusive with that of encrypted data?

Reddit,crypto,Concern for Speed and Scalability of NIST PQC?,2024-09-25 21:23:42,"While I am glad that the NIST announced support for Post-Quantum Algorithms I am concerned about their performance.

Speed and scalability matters in the business world because all organizations are constrained by a budget.

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past. And asking them to train their infosec and opsec teams to learn how to deal with these algorithms that slow down performance will be a difficult task.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3.

Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Originally I was told to refer to the Intel Manuals to learn more about cryptographic hardware extensions.

Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 11:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-10-09 12:18:05.016333

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

        return record;

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

    G = (
        55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240,
        32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424
        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663
        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(p), [0,7]).order()
        115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,
        79820197542983972470655013754473404410649480536210503962616926227235987362275
        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 16:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code. If your team-mates cannot understand how your code works, without it being correct, your team-mates won't be able to improve the code without your help. I thought this was an insightful statement. And it illustrates a common problem in crypto development: we often see code that is secure against the latest attacks but is esoteric. Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Even if the code is flawed, as long as your team-mates can refactor the code the code that is legible but flawed will eventually be improved and outshine the original code that is correct **but** illegible.
