XRP Has Witnessed A Sharp Drop Over The Last 24 Hours The cryptocurrency sector has been observing bearish winds recently, with the drawdown deepening across the market during the past day. Most of the top coins, though, have managed to limit their losses, except for XRP, which has notably underperformed. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crossover That Led To 90% & 180% Rallies Could Soon Form Again The below chart shows how the coin’s recent trajectory has looked like. Following the 14% drop in the last 24 hours, XRP has come down to the $0.52 level. This plunge has also put the asset more than 21% down compared to the $0.66 top that it had seen a few days back. As for why the cryptocurrency has performed this poorly during the past day, perhaps on-chain data can provide some hints. Whales Have Been Active On The Network Recently According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large transactions have been spotted on the XRP network in the last 24 hours. All of these transactions happen to be of a scale that’s generally associated with the whales, who are large entities that can carry a degree of influence in the market. Naturally, one whale can’t move the market on their own, but some number of them together can, which may be exactly what has happened today. Generally, it can be hard to say for certain what the whales’ intentions are when they make moves, but address details can sometimes carry a hint or two. Here are the details of the first of the whale transfers from the past day: As is visible above, the whale moved 17,940,000 XRP, worth around $10.3 million at the time the transfer was executed, from an unknown wallet to an address connected to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. An “unknown wallet” is one that’s not affiliated to any known centralized platform and is likely to be an investor’s personal address. Thus, it would appear that the whale moved coins from their self-custodial wallet to an exchange with this transaction. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike Transfers of this type are called exchange inflows. Since one of the main reasons why investors deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, large exchange inflows can lead to a bearish outcome. The three other XRP whale transactions from the past day were also of the same type, with whales shifting a combined $37.9 million to different platforms. It’s possible that these transfers weren’t for selling at all, but for using a different service that exchanges typically provide. Given the corresponding price trend, though, it’s indeed likely that these moves provided a net selling pressure to the cryptocurrency.

The token is leading the market after becoming the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bonk ‘In Prime Position For Turbo Green Week’ As Price Recovers Key Level Aptos To Expand Its Presence In Asia On Thursday, Aptos Labs, the developer of the Aptos network, announced it had agreed to acquire the Japanese Blockchain developer HashPallete, the company behind Japan’s Palette Chain and a subsidiary of HashPort Inc. The agreement aims to become a “game changer for Japan and the Aptos ecosystem” as the integration with the Japanese blockchain is set to strengthen its presence in the Asian market: Japan has long been a hub of technological innovation, and it’s no different when it comes to blockchain. The country’s unique blend of advanced tech and widespread blockchain adoption makes it a model for Web3 initiatives globally. Today, we’re making one of our boldest strategic moves into this market with our agreement to acquire HashPalette Inc. As part of the acquisition, HashPort Inc. will migrate the Pallete Chain and its subsidiary’s applications to the Aptos Network. The Japanese chain will also have access to the Aptos ecosystem’s security, scalability, and developer tools. The migration is expected to be completed by early 2025, in time for the EXPO2025 DIGITAL WALLET. Moreover, Aptos Labs partnered with HashPort to support local developers, NFT creators, and enterprises by “continuing to build blockchain solutions (…) using Aptos Network’s infrastructure.” APT Leads The Crypto Market Following the announcement, APT’s price saw a daily 11% surge, jumping to the $8.66 resistance level before retracing to the $8.51 mark. This performance crowned the token as the leading crypto amid the market retrace. APT is among the few cryptocurrencies recording green numbers in most timeframes among the top 100 tokens by market cap. The altcoin registers a 7.5% and a 41% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Additionally, its daily market volume soared 41.7%, reaching a $769.6 million trading volume in the last 24 hours. The token’s performance was highlighted by several crypto analysts, who considered that APT has the “most interesting chart” at the moment. According to Yuriy from BikoTrading, the cryptocurrency looks strong as the rising trading volume and the price performance “signs for continued growth.” The trader noted that APT’s price held above the key resistance zone amid the market retrace, which sent the token above Q3’s range highs. Similarly, crypto trader Osbrah stated that APT has been “secretly climbing its way to the most interesting alts charts.” He pointed out that, after October 1’s market sweep, the token had a “clean bullish retest” above the $8 mark. To the trader, the next big resistance is at the $9 mark, which could send APT’s price to the $7.95 support zone if it fails to reclaim it. Meanwhile, another market watcher suggested that the altcoin’s performance could be close to a breakout. Related Reading: Analysts Unfazed By Bitcoin (BTC) Drop, But Should We Fear October 5? Per the post, SUI and APT moved in a “catch-up trade” path for the past year, moving closely together until SUI decoupled in early 2024. This led to a 44-day lagging period for APT before it followed SUI’s movements. After that, APT rose 98% to its yearly high of $18.8 in mid-March. Now, APT has seen a 32-day lagging period after SUI decoupled again in September, showing “incredible amounts of strength.” Based on this, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could follow SUI’s trajectory and kickstart a massive rally in the next two weeks if history repeats.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin’s NVT Cross Signals a Local Top – Is a Major Correction Looming?,2024-10-04 08:00:55+00:00,"Bitcoin has been experiencing some interesting developments in its market indicators, and a recent analysis points to the NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Golden Cross signaling a potential short-term local top. According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, the NVT Golden Cross—a key metric used to determine market valuation relative to transaction volume—has reached a major level. Related Reading: Is This Bitcoin’s Last Big Drop? Expert Points To Key Indicator Local Top Spotted, What Next? The CryptoQuant analyst revealed that Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross has recently reached the 2.9 level, suggesting that the market cap, or price, of Bitcoin, may be outpacing its transaction volume. Particularly, Darkfost explained that a value above 2.2 indicates the possibility of reversing the mean, suggesting that the current valuation could be overextended. On the other hand, a value below -1.6 would indicate that the market is potentially undervalued. For context, the NVT Golden Cross compares the market cap of Bitcoin to the volume of transactions on its network, providing a measure of whether Bitcoin is being traded at a fair value. The signals become stronger when the metric moves deeper into its upper or lower zones. At a current value of 2.9, the indication is that Bitcoin may face short-term price resistance, possibly pointing to a local top at around $65,800, Darkforst revealed. The analyst adds that such levels can gauge potential long and short positions, especially when viewed alongside global chart trends and broader market behaviour. Bitcoin On The Verge Of Major Correction? While the NVT Golden Cross presents a perspective of potential market overvaluation, another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnchain, offers additional insights by analyzing Bitcoin’s movement between exchanges. The recent data shows a significant outflow of Bitcoin from centralized exchanges. This trend of Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges is seen across all three key moving averages: 30-day, 50-day, and 100-day. The analyst revealed that such an outflow hasn’t been observed at this scale since November 2022. Notably, a decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges can be interpreted in multiple ways. Firstly, it often suggests that investors move their assets to more secure storage, such as cold wallets, to hold rather than trade. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Reversal? Here’s What This Key Indicator Suggests This behavior can signal confidence in the asset, as holders may expect its value to increase over time. With fewer BTC available on exchanges for immediate sale, the potential for downward price pressure may decrease, which could set the stage for a bullish momentum in the longer term. However, it can also indicate that traders prepare to exit their positions, anticipating a correction if they foresee market instability or overvaluation.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Miner Selloff Is Calming Down: Green Sign For Rally To Continue?,2024-10-04 08:00:21+00:00,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin miner exchange inflows have been dropping recently, a sign that may be bullish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Miner Exchange Inflow Has Been Declining Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, miners have gradually been reducing their exchange inflows recently. “Exchange inflows” here naturally refer to transactions heading to wallets attached to centralized exchanges from self-custodial addresses. In the context of the current topic, the exchange inflows made by miner-related wallets specifically are of interest. Generally, the main reason why miners transfer to these platforms is for selling, so large exchange inflows from them can be a sign that these chain validators are participating in a selloff. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crossover That Led To 90% & 180% Rallies Could Soon Form Again Miners have constant running costs in the form of electricity bills, so selling from them is a regular occurrence, as without it, they can’t keep their operations going. This regular selling is usually of a scale readily absorbed by the market, so there may be no visible negative effect on the asset’s price. Large and sustained exchange inflows, though, can be something to note, as they may imply unusual selling pressure from this group. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin miner exchange inflows over the history of the cryptocurrency: As the above graph shows, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin miner exchange inflows had plunged to pretty low in the first few months of the year but then underwent a sharp reversal. The reason for this increase could be that the fourth Halving occurred in April. Halvings are periodic events about every four years that permanently cut the BTC block subsidy in half. In the chart, the analyst has also attached the data for the coin issuance on the network (colored in blue). From this metric, the effect of the Halving is apparent, as miners can suddenly only mint about half as many coins after each of these events as before them. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike Miners make their income through two main sources, the transaction fees and the block subsidy, but most of the contribution generally comes from the latter. Thus, the miners depend on the block subsidy to make their income. After the latest Halving, the miners naturally came under immense pressure because their revenue took a drastic hit. The exchange inflow trend would suggest that these chain validators had decided to sell off their reserves in response to this income squeeze. The high inflows from the Bitcoin miners had continued for a while, but the 30-day MA of their exchange inflow has recently reversed, a potential sign that this cohort is finally pulling back on their selling. If this starts a sustained trend, then the cryptocurrency’s price might benefit from it. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced much of its recent recovery during the last few days, as its price is now down to $60,300.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Dip Explained: Key Causes And Where To Expect A Bounce Back To $70,000",2024-10-04 06:30:13+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) recently appeared poised for significant upside momentum and has experienced a notable price correction. Following a two-month high of $66,500 last Friday, the cryptocurrency retraced approximately 6% in the past week to around $60,000 by Thursday. Key Buy Zones For Bitcoin The anticipated bullish trend for Bitcoin was initially fueled by easing economic conditions, particularly following the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates on September 18.  However, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have shifted investor sentiment, prompting many to seek refuge in traditional safe-haven assets like gold.  Additionally, concerns regarding the macroeconomic landscape have intensified, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the possibility of further rate cuts of 0.50% in the months ahead. This confluence of factors has led to a broader market sell-off, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and the top cryptocurrencies on the market experiencing substantial liquidity outflows estimated at nearly $300 million, as reflected in the total crypto market capitalization. Despite the recent decline, crypto analyst VirtualBacon provided a more optimistic outlook on social media, noting that Bitcoin has returned to the “Bull Market Support Band.”  The analyst highlights that this support band has historically provided a cushion during corrections between the current market prices and the $62,500 mark on the weekly timeframe. VirtualBacon emphasized that a weekly close above $58,000 could indicate a healthy correction, setting the stage for a resurgence. Conversely, a break below this threshold would necessitate reevaluating bullish strategies.  The analyst pointed to two key buy zones: $62,500 and a lower range between $58,800 and $60,000. These zones coincide with previous highs and align with the 200-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a significant long-term support level for any bull market. The 200-Day EMA, currently around the $60,000 mark, has been pivotal over the past six months. It has acted as support and resistance during various phases of Bitcoin’s price movements in March, May and July of this year. September Jobs Report Looms Large In his analysis, VirtualBacon explained that if Bitcoin bounces back from $60,000, it would signal strength in the market. However, a daily close below $58,000 – or a weekly close below that level – could signal a potential bearish trend reversal. VirtualBacon outlined a strategy for capitalizing on the current dip, indicating a willingness to accumulate BTC in the $58,000 to $60,000 range, which he views as a high-risk, high-reward zone. Nonetheless, he cautioned that a close below $57,000 would be a significant red flag. Related Reading: Dogecoin On-Chain Spike Triggers 180% Price Rally Prediction—What’s Next? For the analyst, as long as Bitcoin holds above $58,000, there is potential for a higher low, setting the stage for a new price peak above $66,000. However, macroeconomic factors will remain crucial in shaping market sentiment. This week’s release of the September jobs report will be particularly significant, as it will provide insights into the current unemployment rate, which could influence future Bitcoin price movements, according to the analyst: 4.2%: Very bullish for the market. 4.3%: Neutral outlook. 4.4%: Caution advised. 4.5% and above: Bearish implications. At the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Jerome Powell identified 4.4% as a critical threshold. Should the unemployment rate rise above this level, VirtualBacon believes it could signal trouble for the broader economic landscape.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Solo Staking Made Easier? Vitalik Buterin Supports Lower Entry Requirements,2024-10-04 05:00:15+00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin advocates reducing the ETH solo staking requirement to lower the entry barrier and promote greater network decentralization. Buterin Sees 32 ETH Requirement As A Barrier Responding to Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano on X regarding solo staking, Buterin expressed concern that the current 32 ETH requirement presents a bigger obstacle than bandwidth limitations. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Proposes A Privacy Fix for Ethereum For those unfamiliar, solo staking on Ethereum requires an individual validator to stake at least 32 ETH – approximately $75,200 at the current market price of $2,352. Solo staking allows crypto investors to earn passive income while directly contributing to the security of the Ethereum network. Buterin views this high entry threshold as a barrier that prevents smaller ETH holders from participating. He suggested temporarily increasing bandwidth requirements to reduce the minimum staking deposit to 16 or 24 ETH. Buterin elaborated: It’s net-good for both staking accessibility and scale. Then once we figure out peerdas, bandwidth reqs go back down, and once we figure out orbit SSF, the deposit minimum can drop to 1 ETH. It’s important to note that ETH holders can still stake with as little as 1 ETH by using third-party staking services, centralized platforms, or staking pools. However, these options don’t offer the same level of control over one’s ETH as solo staking, where the node operator retains full custody of their holdings. During the Ethereum Singapore 2024 event in September, Buterin emphasized the significance of solo stakers in bolstering Ethereum’s security and decentralization to tackle potential 51% attacks. At the event, Buterin said that even a small increase in the proportion of solo stakers on the Ethereum network could work as an “extra layer of defense” for both security and privacy. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Continue To Thrive While the 32 ETH barrier may discourage small-scale ETH enthusiasts from solo staking, they can still benefit from the growing popularity of Ethereum layer-2 solutions, which have made transactions more affordable. For instance, in June 2024, layer-2 scaling platform Optimism announced the launch of open-source and permissionless fault proofs, enabling users to verify off-chain transactions’ validity securely. Similarly, in August 2024, asset manager Franklin Templeton approved another layer-2 solution when it launched its OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on the Arbitrum network. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record Similarly, crypto exchange Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 rollup Base has witnessed rapid adoption as its total value locked (TVL) currently stands at slightly over $2.12 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama. As layer-2 solutions continue to succeed, their positive impact may extend to the Ethereum network. Crypto analysts, such as CryptoBullet, predict that ETH could rally in Q4 2024. ETH is trading at $2,352 at press time, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

The price is still well below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6640 swing high to the $0.5070 low. The price is now trading above $0.5450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5440 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5550 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5800. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6640 swing high to the $0.5070 low. A clear move above the $0.5850 resistance might send the price toward the $0.600 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6120 resistance or even $0.6250 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5440 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5150 level. The next major support is near the $0.5080 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.4920 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.4850 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5150 and $0.5080.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Over 1.8 Million Addresses Bought 52 Million ETH At $2,350: Will Ethereum Continue Falling?",2024-10-04 03:30:54+00:00,"Ethereum is down when writing, mirroring the general performance across the board. The nearly 2% drop in the crypto scene is due to the contraction of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and top altcoins. At present, the total market cap is down to $2.17 trillion. It could post even more losses should bears press on, reversing the gains of September. Ethereum Under Pressure, Will $2,350 Offer Support? In the last week alone, CoinMarketCap data shows that Ethereum is down 10%, pushing losses below $2,400, a former support, now resistance. While it could appear that the sharp dump of the better part of this week is discouraging participation, some traders are accumulating at around spot rates. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $10 Thesis: What Each Breakout Cycle Says About The DOGE Price IntoTheBlock data on October 3 shows that 1.89 million Ethereum addresses bought 52 million ETH at around the $2,311 and $2,383 range. That a large amount of buyers choose to buy, on average, at $2,350 means this is a support level that traders should closely watch. Considering the number of ETH accumulated, sellers would need to exert more effort to break below this level, forcing the coin towards $2,100 and August lows. Comparing traders’ action and the September range, the $2,350 level falls at around 61.8% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels. What’s Next For ETH? Technically, crypto prices, including ETH, tend to find support around this Fibonacci retracement zone. Accordingly, how prices react between the $2,100 and $2,350 zone will likely shape the medium to long-term trend. Related Reading: What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Analyst Says $71,000 Is The Magic Number A refreshing bounce around this emerging support and Fibonacci retracement zone would be a massive boost. In this case, ETH could rally, even above $2,800, as bulls target $3,500. Conversely, any sharp dump below August and September lows may easily trigger panic selling. Out of this, ETH can slump below $2,100 and $2,000 and may fall to as low as $1,800, confirming losses of early August. Considering the state of price action, sellers have the upper hand. Over the past few trading sessions, centralized exchanges have had massive outflows. Earlier today, The Data Nerd revealed that Wintermute, a crypto market maker, moved 14,221 ETH to Binance, indicating that they might sell. In August, Wintermute and other leading market makers, including Jump Capital, sold over 130,000 ETH, forcing prices lower.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Price Next Move Hinges on Clearing This Crucial Hurdle,2024-10-04 03:28:03+00:00,"Ethereum price extended its decline below the $2,350 level. ETH is now recovering from losses and faces a major hurdle near the $2,300 zone. Ethereum declined further and traded below the $2,350 zone. The price is trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,400 and $2,420 resistance levels to start a decent increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone and extended losses below the $2,400 level. ETH traded below the $2,350 support to move further in a bearish zone like Bitcoin. The price even spiked below the $2,320 support level. A low was formed near $2,311 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,350 level. The price is still below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,655 swing high to the $2,311 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,400 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear move above the trend line resistance might send the price toward the $2,480 resistance. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,655 swing high to the $2,311 low. An upside break above the $2,480 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,550 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,650 level or $2,665. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,350 level. The first major support sits near the $2,300 zone. A clear move below the $2,300 support might push the price toward $2,220. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Here's more of the latest news for Solana devs...  


### 🏗️ Steel Framework

Steel is a new open-source framework developed by Regolith Labs (Ore) to simplify the development of programs on the Solana blockchain.

The framework originated out of a desire to streamline common tasks, reduce boilerplate code, and provide more efficient interfaces for Solana development.

Steel provides a collection of tools and helper functions to reduce the complexity of Solana program development by simplifying the handling of tasks like instruction parsing, cross-program invocations (CPIs), and account data validation.

It's a work in progress but already provides several tools aimed at improving the developer experience:

**Entrypoint Simplification:** Steel reduces the entrypoint boilerplate code by offering helper functions to parse instructions before dispatching to core logic, speeding up initial setup.

**Loaders for Account Data:** Steel includes loaders to parse and validate account data, which are expected to evolve to return mutable or readonly references to inner account data.

**Simplified CPIs:** Common CPIs such as creating token accounts, transferring, minting, and burning tokens are simplified, making interactions between programs easier and more efficient.

Features like initialization scripts, IDL generation, and a no-std-entrypoint for performance optimization are part of Steel's roadmap.

Steel encourages contributions from the Solana developer community to help it grow and evolve as more developers get involved.

[**Introducing: Steel**](https://x.com/HardhatChad/status/1838919676510044523?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  


### 🏙️ Jupiter Metropolis API

The Metropolis API Platform by Jupiter introduces a powerful set of liquidity tools designed to streamline access to liquidity on Solana.

The platform consists of three key APIs:

**Token API:** This API provides detailed token information, including enhanced token metadata and community-verified token tags. It serves as a reliable source of truth for developers and protocols, offering token data that users can trust when interacting with tokens.

**Price API (V2):** The second version of the Price API delivers enriched, real-time price data and historical swap information from Jupiter.

It includes features like Confidence Level, indicating the reliability of the price, especially useful for tokens with wide spreads, and Liquidity Depth, which shows available liquidity and potential price impacts on larger trades.

**Swap API:** Designed to facilitate seamless transactions, this API provides features such as Dynamic Slippage and Instant Routing. It helps developers access the best token swap prices and estimates priority fees for successful transaction completion.

Metropolis aims to simplify integration with Solana’s liquidity, empowering developers to build sustainable applications by providing real-time, accurate, and comprehensive liquidity data.

### 💳 Squads Card SDK

The Squads Card SDK leverages the programmability and security of Squads Protocol smart accounts, which power the self-custodial architecture behind [Fuse Pay](https://fusewallet.com/blog/fuse-pay?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a virtual Visa card that allows users to spend stablecoins in real-world transactions directly from their Fuse wallet.

When a user creates a card account, a separate smart account is deployed, with the main Fuse account acting as the signer. 

The SDK will allow other projects to easily integrate similar functionality, enabling them to launch card products on Solana with full user control, customizable spending limits, and time-locked withdrawals.

For developers, the Squads Card SDK opens up new opportunities to build card-based products that merge on-chain assets with everyday spending. 

Squads Protocol is actively seeking design partners to help shape the future of the Squads Card SDK. 

By participating in the design phase, developers can contribute to the SDK’s development, ensure it meets real-world needs, and take part in creating the next generation of Solana-based payment solutions.

Interested developers can reach out directly to the Squads team via DMs or participate in discussions on Solana developer forums.

[**Squads Card SDK Design Partners Wanted**](https://x.com/simkinstepan/status/1841049380096217259?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  


### ⛓️ Wormhole Era3

**Wormhole Era3** brings upgrades to enhance cross-chain interoperability and improve UX, offering Solana developers new features to build on.

1. **Composable Intents**: Developers can chain multiple cross-chain actions into a single transaction, allowing for seamless asset swaps, DeFi operations, and other complex tasks across multiple blockchains, including Solana.
2. **Native Token Transfers (NTT)**: A new framework that eliminates liquidity fragmentation by preserving the native properties of tokens during transfers, meaning assets maintain their intrinsic qualities when moved across chains without needing to be wrapped. This ensures secure and fluid token movement for projects and financial institutions building on Solana.
3. **Enhanced SDKs**: The Wormhole TypeScript SDK has been revamped, making it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications with advanced UI/UX capabilities.
4. **Institutional Integrations**: Wormhole's new offerings cater to institutional needs, enabling Solana developers to build applications that align with capital markets and RWAs, as seen with partnerships like Securitize and integrations with Google Cloud and AMD.

These improvements in Era3 provide Solana developers tools for building multichain dApps while ensuring security and flexibility.

### 🔒 Hypernative on Solana

Solana projects now have access to Hypernative's platform, including a dedicated risk dashboard and incident response support to enhance security for Solana’s developer ecosystem.

Hypernative’s platform monitors a wide range of risks, including program vulnerabilities, phishing, scams, and market manipulations, offering real-time threat detection and response for both the network and projects building on it. 

Solana is now among more than 130 Web3 projects that utilize Hypernative's enterprise-grade platform, which monitors over $37 billion in digital assets across 40+ blockchains.

Developers building or managing funds on Solana can request a demo of Hypernative’s platform.

No telegram bot and no coding skill required.

Smithii sniper bot works on its website and is too easy to use it, you can search smithii socials for streaming an guides or just take a fast look on the [smithii sniper website](https://sniper.smithii.io/)

As always, the effectiveness (speed) of the sniper depends on which RPC you are using, you can configure a public one (not recommended), or the one you have or simply use Smithii's premium RPC (fast node).

I recently ran it for four hours with 0.1 SOL for the buying amount and made a 100% profit (10 buy/sell cycles - 2 nonprofitable). My settings were 30% take profit, 20% SL, 40% slippage and the only active filter was burn LP, all other settings were default.

I'm experimenting with some trading strategies and I noticed that whenever I submit a transaction it takes somewhere close to 15-ish seconds. The fastest one I managed to see so far was 7 seconds. Is that expected? What are some best practices for performing fast transactions?

I know, sometimes the network gets congested but even when it's not this is still a problem. 

I tried using the public mainnet RPC as well as some free tier RPC nodes from Alchemy and Quiknode and the results are about the same. I also tried to increase the priority fee, which, imo, doesn't make much difference. 

I saw some traders performing sandwhiching, where they manage to pack 2 transactions into one block having a single transaction in between. Is that only possible with running a private RPC node or a Validator? ",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

I even tried with insanely high priority fees of 0.01 Sol and that seemed to make it much quicker, but still taking over 6 seconds.

Also, I’m curious about the risk that one assumes when launching a coin. Do these rug pullers have any risk or serious overhead costs? I see there are plenty of cheap easy ways to launch new shitcoins.  If you’re pumping your own coin on launch (on DexScreener Moonshot, for example) but no one is buying, I assume that would mean that there’s no real liquidity. If no one is there to buy, then the SOL you pumped into your new coin disappears because there’s no one to dump to. Am I correct in my assessment? I’ve always traded bigger coins with huge caps and plenty liquidity. I’ve never understood the concept of a startup coin. Maybe I’m missing fundamental knowledge of how the market works. My ROI% is a solid -40% so far. Small sample size but most of it was due to rug pulls within 8 hrs of a coin’s launch.

Habp5bncMSsBC3vkChyebepym5dcTNRYeg2LVG464E96  (play flip gg)

fLiPgg2yTvmgfhiPkKriAHkDmmXGP6CdeFX9UF5o7Zc   ( play flip gg)

I did some sleuthing in my wallet as this thing is in my wallet too.: but then i saw other addresses too that,have also sent me 0.000001 sol. I looked o
into those and:
THOSE ARE ADRESS POISONING SCAMS.

I dont know how it exactly enters my wallet but what it does is this:

It sends 0.000001 sol to your wallet after you interact with a TRUSTED address. 
And when you look at the SENDER address, it ALMOST looks EXACTLY like the address you used to do a legitimate transaction to/with.

Example: you have 2 wallets. 
Wallet 1 is called  ABC1....9XYZ

You send 1 sol from wallet 1 to wallet 2.

Then the scambot immediately sends 0.000001 sol 
to wallet 2 .
When you look in wallet 2, you see the transaction of what wallet 1 has sent (legitimate)
PLUS you will see OTHER transaction of what the SCAMBOT has sent you.
When you look at the scambot/sender address, you will notice that THE ADDRESS IS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE LEGITIMATE ADDRESS 

        Wallet 1   (SAFE)  ABC1....9XYZ

other sender        (SCAM)  ABOI... PXYZ

another send        (SCAM) ABCi....gXYZ

CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE A POISONING SCAM ATTEMPT. when you do not pay attention you could EASILY copy the WRONG address to send your funds to.

It sends you transactions from addresses that look like the ones you trust and interacted with in the past.
It does this immediately. I made a fresh wallet and sent 1 sol to it, As soon as i received my 1 sol there were THREE OTHER sends of 0.00001 sol from addresses that looks ALMOST IDENTICAL.

Reddit,solana,World record egg big rug ,2024-10-02 05:36:01,"Hey everyone,

I want to shed light on a recent scam involving the World Record Egg Instagram account — you know, the one famous for having the most-liked post ever.

The account was recently acquired by a new team, but instead of just riding on its popularity, they decided to use it for launching several Solana-based cryptocurrency projects. Their end goal? Draining investor funds using shady tactics, like controlling the majority of the token supply and dumping large amounts (150k, 50k $SOL) repeatedly, which resulted in a Rug Pull and left many investors at a huge loss.

What happened:

	•	Leveraged the World Record Egg brand to build credibility.
	•	Launched three separate tokens.
	•	Manipulated the supply, dumped tokens at a high price, and caused the value to crash while cashing out with millions.
	•	Complete lack of transparency regarding the real people behind the new projects.

What you can do:

	1.	Report this scam wherever you see them promoting their projects.
	2.	Stay vigilant if you follow the account, and don’t get lured in by investment promises.
	3.	Share this post to spread the word so others don’t fall for it.

If you or anyone you know has been affected, feel free to reach out. I’m trying to gather as many victims as possible to escalate this issue and hand over a complete report to the financial authorities.

Stay safe and protect your investments!

Reddit,solana,Blockchain Vending Platform powered by Solana,2024-10-01 00:17:27,"Hey Solana Community,

I'm Will Okojie, co-founder of chebeMCHN, and I wanted to share something that’s been in the works for a while now. We’re building a smart vending platform that goes beyond just convenience — we’re leveraging the power of the Solana ecosystem to completely reimagine how vending machines operate. 🚀

Our vision? Imagine walking up to a vending machine, paying with your favorite stablecoins, and getting more than just a snack or a drink — you get an NFT receipt tied to your purchase, unlocking rewards, discounts, and some pretty cool perks down the line. 🌟 Not only that, but we’re aiming to integrate loyalty programs where members can actually earn from staking the funds we keep on-chain. It’s about giving back to the community and creating a platform that’s rewarding in more ways than one.

We’ve launched our first machine in Denver and are rolling out new locations soon, and we’re pumped to start integrating Solana’s fast, secure, and low-cost network to make all this possible.

It’s still early days for us, but Solana’s tech is giving us the flexibility to offer everything from stablecoin payments to NFTs and staking rewards—all through a vending machine! Who would’ve thought?

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any advice as we work toward bringing this project to life. Excited to be part of this community and can’t wait to see where this journey with Solana takes us.

Reddit,solana,Player pumps player memecoins ,2024-09-30 21:52:08,"Who’s building this? I have a few ideas. 

One of them, 


Memecoins are solely created with the motive of merging with other memecoins and garnering a bigger community. 
Every memecoin bonded on the platform will be deployed on raydium with 500k in liquidity. 

Memecoins merge with other memecoins. 
Communities merge with other communities. 
Bigger cult. Bigger pump. 

Memecoins are created in tranches, each memecoin has to reach a threshold to merge with other ones.
Everytime a memecoin is created a parallel telegram chat is spawned. 
Everytime a memecoin is about to merge. A new telegram chat is formed with a new name. Where community members are redirected and can now chat. Increasing the size of the community and number of holders. 
The name can be bid on by the community and names can be decided on the fly. Community V community. 

Once a memecoin reaches a threshold supply is added for more buyers to come in. 
It repeats itself till we have 500k in mc.

Reddit,solana,How ​​to properly create meme coins and ensure fair profits as a developer,2024-09-30 14:40:08,"Hello,

I am creating a small team to develop my well-structured idea for a meme coin. We have allocated some SOL for the LP and for the development of the website, graphics, etc.

Theoretically, the idea could generate profits, but I want to make sure that I can withdraw my money fairly and keep the project active, ensuring that the team also receives its benefits.

If I lock up 90% of the LP, how can I withdraw the remaining 10% for myself and the investors? Are there other ways to divide the LP that you would recommend?

Note: I invite all Portuguese speakers to join our Discord group to discuss ideas and exchange experiences about the world of meme coins",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056
Reddit,solana,SOL RPC Nodes Management Tools,2024-09-30 10:10:15,"Hey, Solana Fam!  
Today I’d like to tell you how to manage your RPC nodes to get the best performance and the lowest downtimes possible. We will take the GetBlock RPC node provider as an example as they support *SOL RPC nodes* on Mainnet and Testnet. We are gonna learn how they manage their high-speed RPC, and discover some services for node management, handy tools, tips, and tricks  
Let’s jump right into it!

***How GetBlock - RPC Provider Works***

When running an RPC node it’s crucial to be always aware of the consistency and availability of your node. To do so, you have to utilize some robust management and monitoring tools. Here’s an example of the tools GetBlock is using:

* Prometheus open-source monitoring system
* Grafana observability platform; (the latter sources data from the first one.)
* The health sidecar
* Alertmanager service in Slack
* Loadservice
* Auto-switching system

Prometheus gathers metrics and databases to display in Grafana. Prometheus is also bonded to Alertmanager service to inform the team in Slack about all events regarding infrastructure status. The health sidecar helps GetBlock monitor the current height and health of the nodes. To get immediate notifications from the monitoring tool GetBlock connected it to the Alertmanager service in Slack. It helps to get the fastest notification if some issue occurs and always double-check when it’s resolved. The health sidecar is also connected to the auto-switching system. So if the block deviation occurs, the unhealthy node is instantly switched to a healthy one. Last but not least, the node must be updated to the latest versions. This way GetBlock constantly monitors blockchains’ GitHub repositories and social media to find out about the upcoming updates first in hand.  
**All of that helps GetBlock to reach the highest node availability of 99%!**

If you don’t wanna experience all the hustles associated with running and maintaining your own SOL RPC node. You can simply connect to RPC nodes for 50+ blockchains with GetBlock. It’s now even available with 30% OFF your first shared node subscription.",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

Reddit,ethereum,I got hacked and stolen $45K off my wallet,2024-10-04 07:37:30,"I’m a video editor/programmer who with another guy online started to develop an editing tool that we were planning on selling. We had already started developing the tool and I knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online).

About 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and I downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (I know it’s dumb I don’t need to be lectured about it I know). That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money. I don’t know what I’m gonna do from there, I’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and I was supposed to go to University next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone. I’m really at a point where I want to give up on life.

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

🔗 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

How can I validate whether these data types are actually correct? I mean what if the data types aren't correct? How can I check that?

  
I mean I don't think this would work:

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

Let’s dive into this fascinating topic and see how it can transform your understanding of cryptocurrency.

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Reddit,ethereum,Can KYC Add Security Without Compromising Decentralization? 🤔 ,2024-09-16 19:18:52,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](https://z-epub.com/book/the-bitcoin-standard-epub-download)

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

I have a similar question regarding, S&p 500. 
Let's say, S&P 500 gets a constant bid from investors all across and they keep allocating money on a monthly basis, while s&p 500 doesn't have a fixed supply a constant bid to buy s&p 500 would make it an up only asset isn't it?  And could keep going up even if s&p 500 gets overvalued.

Reddit,bitcoin,Is the 4-year Bitcoin cycle more related to global liquidity than the halving event?,2024-10-03 16:31:40,"I've been thinking about the 4-year cycle in Bitcoin, and I'm starting to believe it might be less about the halving event and more about global liquidity. While the halving reduces supply, wouldn't the overall liquidity in the global markets (due to central bank policies, interest rates, etc.) have a stronger influence on the price of Bitcoin? For example, when liquidity is high, more capital tends to flow into riskier assets like BTC. But in tighter liquidity conditions, investors might shy away from volatile assets.

Has anyone else considered this? What are your thoughts on how much global liquidity affects Bitcoin's price cycles compared to the halving?",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056
Reddit,bitcoin,A truly inspiring Bitcoin story...,2024-10-03 01:04:36,"***** This story is not mine. It was posted 12h ago on [Twitter](https://x.com/BitBuyer313/status/1841459316051603874) by [@BitBuyer313](https://x.com/BitBuyer313)

No matter how hopeless and bleak your financial situation is, never give up. Here's my own personal story and a peek into my past.

Let's rewind back to 2011, I was 5 years into a drug and drinking problem, got a DUI, went to prison and when I got out I was over $30k in debt due to fines, lawyer fees etc.

I had to move back into my dad's house and the drug problem continued.
By 2013 most of my friends were dead from drug overdoses, or in prison and I was still $25k in debt.
I realized I was going to end up dead or in prison as well if I didn't make a change.

I managed to find myself an efficiency apartment I could afford, and the local fire department was gracious enough to give me a chance since my prison record was only DUI related.
I worked full time, and on evenings and weekends I went to fire school for an entire summer (till I was interior certified), helped with fundraisers, and started paying off my debt.

Being on the flip side of drugs was a sobering experience, most of the medical calls we ran were fentanyl overdoses and it was eye opening to see the devastation drugs caused the immediate family members of the addicted individual, I witnessed more death in one year than most people will experience in their entire lives.

Surrounding myself with a new group of friends from the fire dept and staying busy by working and volunteering 24/7 was enough to keep me out of trouble. 

By 2016 my debt was finally paid off and I actually had several grand in savings but never thought I'd be able to retire due to understanding how rampantly out of control inflation was, I was looking into gold, real estate etc. to figure out where I could start parking my money, but nothing seemed to be the perfect solution.

Then one day in early summer of 2017 I discovered Bitcoin while watching a documentary on the silk road. I was immediately fascinated. I studied it for a couple weeks and finally pulled the trigger making my first purchases 2 weeks before the fork wars kicked into full gear.

I was unsure if I made the right decision at the time, my friends laughed at me, and my family was concerned I fell victim to a Ponzi scheme, but I didn't let any criticism dissuade me. Then came the euphoric pump to $20k, I felt vindicated till the price collapsed and I received even more mockery for not selling. This rinse and repeat happened for another full cycle, but I had made up my mind that I was riding my #Bitcoin stack to zero or to a million. 

With each passing year my conviction only grew stronger as my knowledge on the topic increased.

Fast forward to present day and I have a higher net worth then the average median retiree and I'm only in my mid 30s. 

Thanks to #Bitcoin and the grace of God, I not only have my life back on track, but I'm looking at retiring a couple decades early which will allow me to pursue my true passions.

If you made it this far, I appreciate your time and hope this can inspire even one person who feels like their situation is hopeless.

Getting yourself out of a deep hole when the odds are stacked against you isn't easy, but nothing is impossible and it gets easier with each passing day.

I wish you all the best of luck in your own individual journeys through life.
Keep stacking Bitcoin and with time, you will be rewarded.

And, to the surprise of no one, we **hit an all-time high in the global M2**, ending the period of monetary contraction and starting up the money printers again.

https://preview.redd.it/vqttrc71gbsd1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=57a2a980aa6625210f2fa5a7301d185acb49ef05

The main component in global M2 is not the US FED, but the China central Bank, which is responsible **for approximately 45% of the world’s money supply**. And China has recently starting to implement several measures to accelerate its base money expansion, not yet shown in the charts:

We all know what happens with monetary expansions: the value of each unit of money in circulation drops, i.e., the price of everything increases. In terms of assets, we know that **Bitcoin is the fastest horse** in the race. As an illustration, please take a look at the following chart showing the year-over-year percentage change in global M2 and the price of Bitcoin. You can see that they have a high correlation.

Long-time Trezor user here, but recently I had a revelation that might save some of you Android users in the UK a headache.
The Challenge:  Picked up a Jade for my brother, but Green Wallet (a popular choice) isn't available for Android in the UK (come on, Green!). Needed a way to track his address balances.
The ""Aha!"" Moment:  Spent a whole day testing various third-party apps, only to realize... ‍♂️  I've been using Trezor Suite Lite for two years and it already does exactly what I need!
The Power of Open Source:  This is why I love open-source platforms like Trezor Suite. It seamlessly integrates with your hardware wallet, regardless of brand. Trezor Suite Lite generates new receive addresses, tracks balances perfectly, and works flawlessly on Android (including the UK!).
Sharing is Caring:  Hopefully this saves someone else the trouble I went through. No need for fancy third-party apps when you have this hidden gem in your back pocket (or rather, on your phone).

Reddit,bitcoin,"Created a Simple BTC ""What If"" Calculator – More Flexible and Open Source",2024-10-02 22:05:08,"Hey r/Bitcoin community!

I've been using various ""What If I Bought Bitcoin"" calculators and compound interest websites, but I found that many of them weren't as flexible as I needed. I wanted a tool that allowed me to:

* **Specify custom date ranges**
* **Input different amounts on different dates**
* **Simulate regular purchases with varying frequencies and amounts**

So, I decided to create a simple website to address these needs: [BTC ""What If"" Calculator](https://btc-what-if-calculator.vercel.app/)

**What Does It Do?**

* **Single Purchase Simulation**: Calculate potential profit or loss from a one-time Bitcoin purchase over any date range you choose.
* **Historical Analysis**: Analyze Bitcoin's historical performance over custom time periods with interactive charts.
* **Regular Purchases Simulation**: Simulate recurring Bitcoin investments (daily, weekly, or monthly) with customizable amounts and frequencies, even handling semi-complex compound interest scenarios.

**Why I Built It**

I wanted something straightforward yet flexible. The existing tools didn't allow me to input different amounts on different dates or customize the frequency of regular purchases. This calculator aims to keep things simple while providing the flexibility to model various investment scenarios.

**Open Source**

The project is open source! You can check out the code, suggest improvements, or contribute here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Publicker/btc-what-if-calculator)

Feel free to give it a try, and I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just curious about potential Bitcoin investment outcomes, I hope you find this tool useful.

Thanks!",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

Well...
On maturity after a year the interest goes back to a standard account.

After the year the interest gained is a measley £100. Compared to a DCA in Bitcoin would be a gain of £800 over the same time period.

These numbers aren't exact and over just a year Bitcoin might not perform as well as 8% even, but I think it still goes to show savings accounts are pretty useless.

What would you do with the savings going forward? All in Bitcoin or keep as emergency funds.  ",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056
Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Under Siege: Let's Turn Uptober Into the Ultimate Short Squeeze! 🚀🔥,2024-10-03 12:02:27,"Hey fam,

I hope you're all doing well. I've been keeping a close eye on Bitcoin as we step into October—**Uptober**, as we like to call it for its history of bullish runs. But something feels off this time. Instead of the usual upward momentum, we're seeing a dip that's got a lot of people scratching their heads. It's only day three, and I couldn't help but wonder: what's really going on here?

**The Hidden Hands at Play**

After digging deeper, it seems that some major players—let's call them the ""big shorts""—are pulling strings behind the scenes. They're heavily shorting Bitcoin, placing massive sell orders to drive the price down. The goal? To instill fear and uncertainty among retail investors like us, hoping we'll panic and sell off our holdings.

**Why Would They Do This?**

Bitcoin isn't just another asset; it's a movement toward decentralized finance that challenges traditional financial institutions. These big shorts thrive in the old system—a system where they hold the power. 

By suppressing Bitcoin's price, they're hoping we'll panic, sell off, and let them scoop up more at a discount. Classic move, right?

**But We've Got Memes and Dreams**

We're not just investors; we're a community. And if there's one thing that unites us, it's our love for memes and a good underdog story.

* **Reclaiming Uptober**: Let's turn this month around and make Uptober live up to its name! 
* **Diamond Hands Unite**: We've held strong before, and we can do it again. 💎👐
* **Whale Watching**: Keep an eye on those big fish, but don't let them dictate our moves. 

**The Fundamentals Are Stronger Than Ever**

The fundamentals of Bitcoin are still rock solid:

* **Growing Adoption**: More people and businesses are embracing Bitcoin every day.
* **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million will ever exist, and some are already lost forever.
* **Strong Network**: The technology behind Bitcoin is as secure and robust as ever.

Nothing has fundamentally changed to justify a price drop. If anything, this could be a setup for a strong rebound.

**What Can We Do?**

1. **Stay Calm and HODL**: Don't let short-term fluctuations shake your long-term belief.
2. **Buy the Dip (If It Makes Sense for You)**: Not financial advice, but lower prices can be an opportunity.
3. **Spread the Word**: Share the memes, educate newcomers, and keep the community spirit alive.

**The Power of the Short Squeeze**

If we collectively decide not to sell—and even consider buying more—we can put pressure on those short positions. A short squeeze could force the big shorts to buy back Bitcoin at higher prices to cover their positions, driving the price up even further. It's a classic move, and we've seen it work before in other markets.

**This Is About More Than Just Profits**

At its core, this is about standing up against market manipulation and supporting a financial system that empowers individuals. Bitcoin represents financial freedom and innovation. By holding strong, we're not just protecting our investments; we're advocating for a better financial future.

**Let's Write Our Own Uptober Story**

It's only the beginning of the month—we have plenty of time to flip the script. Let's not let a few bearish days define October. Together, we can turn those red candles green and make this month one to remember.

Who's ready to reclaim Uptober and send Bitcoin soaring? 🚀🌕

Just moved to Australia. I currently have a Coinbase, Crypto.com & Metamask wallet where I purchase/hold my crypto.

Since I’m still learning, I don’t know the in’s and out’s of everything, especially surrounding the ATM’s they have here like LocalCoin and CoinFlip. (Attached one in a link).

My question; are these actually still able to make it anonymous? On these I believe it says you have to sign up with a phone number to send a verify code (which could be linked to your identity, then it scans your wallet to send the Crypto to after depositing cash).

I understand these do have crazy fees like 5%-15%.

I’m just curious to hear peoples thoughts? Is it worth purchasing through this means and sending it to my metamask wallet or will it still be identifiable to me?",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

Every exchange has delisted it because it works too good as a privacy coin.

There are powerful people shorting Monero, from institutions on Kraken (you need $10M minimum to be able to) to prominent people in the financial and crypto community.

The price is suppressed, go ahead and look at the chart and tell me that's normal.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Mcap per node: valid valuation/decentralization measure?,2024-10-03 15:25:48,"I was toying around with finding how much the market values each node of a decentralized network...

Only considering ""relay"" like nodes, not validators.

To me, having Mcap/node > Bitcoin's means your network could be overvalued given current centralization/lack of decentralization. It could also mean that the market is pricing in future benefit/utility provided by a network despite its current lack of decentralization. Any of these networks could become more decentralized going forward, I'm not trying to knock them, although BNB is a bit concerning to me lol.

\*Note: Solana numbers are from 2023, I could not find anything more current. I had to subtract consensus nodes from total nodes to derive the number of rpc nodes.

I could not find node counts for TON, ADA, AVAX, or LINK taht did not include validator counts, if anyone can point me to that information I would appreciate the help!

A dozen congressmen intensely grilled the SEC commissioners about all their shady and lawless practices. These are the best parts: https://x.com/BanklessHQ/status/1838602054115512769

Gary Gensler was unable to respond to most of the responses and kept waffling. There were multiple times where congressmen got so pissed off with Gensler that they interrupted him and let SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce respond. Pierce kept agreeing with the congressmen and seemed like she was secretly happy the congressmen finally gave her a voice.

**TL;DW**:

* House representatives got the SEC to admit again that cryptocurrencies are not securities
* Got the SEC to admit that they have been purposefully been ambiguous about regulations, which caused malicious damage to the crypto industry, both to exchanges like Coinbase and to banks that serviced those exchanges like Silvergate which would done fine had the regulations not changed overnight.
* Gensler and Crenshaw were roasted multiple times
* House Majority Whip Emmer basically called Gensler a fat liar and said he lied in court. He was so pissed off at Gensler. Emmer said that the SEC broke the law and lied multiple times.
* Torres used Pokemon and sports cards to show how Gensler regulations would classify sales of collectible cards as securities. Gensler was unable to answer why sales of a Yankee's ticket are not securities and again avoids answering the question, which he immediately got called out for.
* Congressmen said that the SEC's treatment of NFTs as securities instead of as collectibles was ridiculous and a 1st-amendment violation.
* Multiple congressmen talked about Operation Choke Point 2.0 and the SEC's role in it and harming the financial industry

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Monthly Optimists Discussion - October 2024,2024-10-01 09:04:07,"Welcome to the Monthly Optimists Discussion thread. As the title implies, the purpose of this thread is to promote discussion which is guardedly optimistic about cryptocurrency topics. This thread is intended to be a counterweight to the Skeptics Discussion thread and will be pinned when the markets are bearish.

Please read the rules and guidelines before participating.

---
&nbsp;

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence. For example, announcing an obscure online store is adopting coin X for payments and then speculate Amazon will adopt it next without evidence. Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator. Please report shilling or any comments which violate the rules.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

  On page 5 it mentions that embarrassingly parallel problems *form only a small fraction of the problem set at NSA.*


  They prefer vector computers with a single large memory over (new at the time) MPP machines with thousands of processors and distributed memory.

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past. And asking them to train their infosec and opsec teams to learn how to deal with these algorithms that slow down performance will be a difficult task.",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

NOTE = I don't know if I'll release the code on github, surely at the moment it's a bit messy :P",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

i think if i stick to the principle of avoiding using any kind of ""required"" service provider (myself included) and allowing the frontend and the peerjs-server to be hosted independently, im on track for creating a chat system with the ""fewest moving parts"". im hope you will agree this is true p2p and i hope i can use this as a step towards unparalleled privacy and security.

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments.

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Reddit,crypto,Advice getting papers published to IACR,2024-08-05 01:33:34,"Hello, I'm attempting to publish a couple of papers to the IACR ePrint.  Both my papers have been rejected with little advice on what I need to do to correct them to be ready for publication.  My guess is that since I don't hail from a specific university, that they are auto-rejecting my papers.  Is there anyone around with some experience publshing papers that would be willing to give a pointer or two?

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);
        record.write(signature);
        record.end_size_header();
        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-10-04 12:17:58.435056

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (
        55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240,

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663
        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(p), [0,7]).order()
        115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 16:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code. If your team-mates cannot understand how your code works, without it being correct, your team-mates won't be able to improve the code without your help. I thought this was an insightful statement. And it illustrates a common problem in crypto development: we often see code that is secure against the latest attacks but is esoteric. Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Even if the code is flawed, as long as your team-mates can refactor the code the code that is legible but flawed will eventually be improved and outshine the original code that is correct **but** illegible.
