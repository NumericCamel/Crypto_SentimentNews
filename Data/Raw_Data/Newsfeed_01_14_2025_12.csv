RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Could Crash Into $50,000s Before Skyroacketing, Claims Fundstrat CEO",2025-01-14 11:00:36+00:00,"In a recent appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Tom Lee, Fundstrat Capital CIO and head of research, suggested that Bitcoin may still have a ways to fall before posting a substantial recovery. During the January 13 segment, Lee spoke about the broader market concerns—such as inflation, bond yields, and earnings—before drawing a parallel to the crypto space, specifically Bitcoin’s trajectory. Could Bitcoin Crash Into The $50,000s? “Bitcoin is down roughly 15% from its highs which for a hyper volatile asset is a normal correction and following global liquidity. We are early in the halving cycle,” Lee remarked, underscoring that price swings of this magnitude are common in the digital assets realm. He also elaborated on technical markers indicating future volatility, stating, “One level would be $70,000.” A less likely scenario, but still possible, is a crash into the $50,000s. “It could go as low as the $50,000s. But that’s again not a new level. That’s where it touches before it begins to rally,” Lee remarked. Related Reading: 8 Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2025: What Banks, Hedge Funds And Experts Say Lee’s perspective paints a picture of a two-pronged price movement for Bitcoin: a potential drop to the “$50,000s,” followed by a climb that could reach, in his words, “maybe $200,000 or $250,000.” He noted that despite the possibility of a downward move, long-term holders should not be deterred. “Bitcoin is something you need to be long-term focused on. I don’t think anyone is losing money buying here at $90,000. If they are trying to time this, maybe they get lucky and it goes to $70,000 but to me, Bitcoin could be significantly higher this year, maybe $200,000 or $250,000. So, I think $90,000 is still a great entry point,” the Fundstrat CEO stated. Lee’s remarks came amid a broader discussion on market dynamics. The conversation opened with the recent dip in equities and whether the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause rate cuts might spook investors. Lee pointed to upcoming inflation data as a critical pivot, explaining, “We’ve been correcting now for almost a month… I would like to see CPI come in below 2.5% or so. I think that would give that jolt of confidence to markets on top of earnings.” Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In He went on to highlight what he sees as short-term noise around inflation statistics, which have been muddled by external events such as hurricanes and fires. “The hurricanes last year have muddled some of the inflation quality because for instance, hotel reservations would go up… It will muddle used car prices as well,” Lee said, adding that once these anomalies clear, overall inflation could register lower. In discussing Federal Reserve policy, Lee maintained a balanced stance, saying, “I think the best case is the Fed doing one cut because the economy’s strong enough and they are still dovish… They will make their way to neutral. If they push the cuts to 2026 and 2027, that’s a longer rate to support markets.” He believes the markets remain sensitive to policy uncertainty, particularly under a new administration. When asked whether stocks were overvalued, Lee drew a parallel to bond yields: “To me, the ten-year even if it gets to 5%, is a 20 PE multiple on a ten-year bond… The median PE is 17 times. I think stocks are giving you much better value than a bond right now.” At press time, BTC traded at $95,618.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Prognose: Vorübergehende Schwäche und Chance auf neue Kursrekorde?,2025-01-14 10:13:18+00:00,"Ethereum zählt nicht umsonst zu den wichtigsten Kryptowährungen der Welt. Die aktuelle Nummer 2 der Kryptowelt punktet vorwiegend mit seinen Anwendungen für ein dezentralisiertes Finanzwesen. Hier stehen die sogenannten „Smart Contracts“ im Mittelpunkt des Interesses der Wirtschaft. Die „automatisierten“ Verträge benötigen keine zentrale Instanz mehr und schließen Banken zunehmend aus dem Finanzkreislauf aus. Kurskorrektur vor dem nächsten Aufschwung Angesichts dieser Innovation ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass das Ethereum-Netzwerk als zukunftssicher gilt. Trotzdem musste dessen Kryptowährung Ether zuletzt einen Einbruch von rund 10 Prozent hinnehmen. Jetzt befürchten die Anleger einen weiteren Kursrutsch. Angesichts der bevorstehenden Amtsübernahme von Donald Trump in den USA hatten viele Investoren gehofft, dass es ab sofort nur noch bergauf gehen würde. Doch der Backlash kam, wie erwartet, schließlich gehören Korrekturen zur hohen Volatilität bei Kryptos. Zusätzlich sorgte ein Ethereum-Wal für Unruhe, er schien die Geduld verloren zu haben und trennte sich von einem Teil seiner Positionen und nahm damit sogar Verluste in Kauf. Das ist erstaunlich, schließlich scheint die Krypto-Zukunft zumindest auf dem Papier rosig zu sein. Kursgewinne vorweggenommen Ethereum kann schließlich, genau wie Bitcoin, auf die ersten zugelassenen Spot-ETFs verweisen, die für eine stärkere Durchdringung der Märkte mit Ether sorgen sollten. Der ehemals unerbittliche Gegner Gary Gensler, seines Zeichens Chef der amerikanischen Wertpapierbehörde SEC, ist zurückgetreten und Donald Trump will alles unternehmen, um Krypto in den USA zu stärken. Trotzdem zeigt Ethereum Schwäche und ist von seinem Allzeithoch weit entfernt. Mit der Zulassung des ersten ETH-Spot-ETFs stieg der Kurs zwar kurzfristig über die 4.000-Dollar-Marke, doch seither ging es bergab. Lediglich vor einer Woche erlebte Ethereum wieder einen Aufstieg, der jedoch nur von kurzer Dauer war. Doch diese Entwicklung war auch bei der Zulassung der ersten Bitcoin-Spot-ETFs zu beobachten. Die Märkte hatten die erhofften Kurssteigerungen schon zuvor vorweggenommen und benötigten einige Zeit, um die weiteren Entwicklungen zu analysieren und darauf zu reagieren. Das wird bei Ethereum offenbar nicht anders sein. Neuer Schub nach Amtseinführung von Trump? Die Geschichte von Ethereum zeigt jedenfalls, dass sich ETH im Januar eines Jahres zumeist als bullish erweist. Angesichts dieser Historie käme es nicht überraschend, wenn der Coin in den nächsten zwei Wochen wieder zulegen würde. Zahlreiche Analysten zeigen sich jedenfalls optimistisch, dass mit der Inkraftsetzung der ersten Deregulierungsmaßnahmen der neuen US-Regierung der Kryptomarkt und damit auch Ethereum wieder deutliche Kursgewinne einfahren werden. Alternative Solaxy Wer als Investor hingegen eine Alternative zu Ethereum sucht, der könnte einen Blick auf den neuen Meme-Coin Solaxy ($SOLX) werfen. Dieser absolviert derzeit seinen Presale auf Ethereum, bildet jedoch aufgrund seiner technischen Ausgestaltung eine Brücke zur Blockchain von Solana. Dort nutzt er als Multi-Chain-Coin günstige Kosten und Geschwindigkeit, um das Beste aus beiden Welten für sich zu generieren. 10 Millionen Euro sind innerhalb kürzester Zeit in das neue Projekt geflossen, das beweist, dass die Anleger an die Idee von Solaxy glauben. Mit einem Preis von nur 0,0016 Dollar für 1 Solaxy ($SOLX) ist der Token noch preiswert, das könnte sich dramatisch ändern, wenn der Coin erst einmal auf einer der Kryptobörsen zum Kauf gelistet wird. Alle Informationen zu Solaxy ($SOLX) finden sich auf den entsprechenden Seiten von X und Telegram.  ",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Top hedge fund manager: Bitcoin mogelijk beste crypto investering 2025 – welke crypto nu kopen?,2025-01-14 10:12:36+00:00,"Is Bitcoin de beste crypto van het moment? Dat is de vraag die veel crypto traders zichzelf stellen net aan het begin van het nieuwe jaar. Volgen Tom Lee, mede-oprichter van Fundstrat Global Advisors, is het antwoord op die vraag een overduidelijke “ja!”. De hedge fund manager geeft echter wel aan dat je Bitcoin dan op het juiste moment moet kopen. Dat betekent dat je nu nog moet afwachten, aangezien hij denkt dat de bodem voor de Bitcoin koers nog niet bereikt is. Dat is verrassend aangezien de BTC koers op het moment op €93,000 staat, bijna 10% lager dan in het midden van December. Voorspellingen voor Bitcoin van hedge fund manager Tom Lee’s voorspellingen zijn op Wall Street zeer gerespecteerd. Zo werkte hij 15 jaar als Chief Equity Strategist bij JP Morgan & Chase. Daarnaast wat hij als hoofdonderzoeker bij Fundstrat een van de eerste analisten die formeel onderzoek over Bitcoin deelde met zijn klantenkring. In een recent onderzoek met CNBC liet de hedge fund manager weten dat de correctie van 10-15% die we op het moment zien hartstikke normaal is voor een volatiel financieel product zoals Bitcoin. Hij geeft ook aan dat de prijsbeweging van Bitcoin gepaard gaat met de liquiditeit van de financiële markt in het algemeen. Dit is correct, want ook de aandelenmarkt had het de afgelopen periode moeilijk. Source: Google De hedge fund manager voorspelt dat de koers van Bitcoin de periode nog wel wat verder kan zakken. Persoonlijk denkt hij dat Bitcoin het prijsniveau van $70,000 zal aantikken voordat het de rally omhoog weer inzet. Dat prijsniveau is helemaal geen verrassing. Zoals we in bovenstaande afbeelding kunnen zien is $70,000 ongeveer het prijsniveau waar Bitcoin vroeger wel vaker tegenaan zat. Toen diende dit prijsniveau echter als weerstand. Toms voorspelling is dus dat dit niveau nu als ondersteuning voor de koers zal dienen. Mocht de koers toch door dit niveau heen breken, veroorzaakt door slechte economische omstandigheden in de Verenigde Staten, dan verwacht hij dat $50,000 het volgende punt is waar Bitcoin naartoe kan zakken. Ook dit is een historisch prijsniveau waar Bitcoin al vaker tegenaan heeft gezeten. Belangrijke data voor de Bitcoin koers De correctie waar we nu inzitten is grotendeels veroorzaakt door negatieve economische data die de afgelopen tijd naar buiten is gekomen. Zo verwacht de voorzitter van de Amerikaanse centrale bank in 2025 geen vier maar twee renteverlagingen. Dit zorgde er eind december al voor dat de crypto- en aandelenmarkt de weg naar beneden zochten. Vorige week, op 7-januari, kwam het maandelijkse JOLTS rapport naar buiten. Daarin werd bekend gemaakt dat de Amerikaanse economie meer banen had gecreëerd dan verwacht. Dat klinkt positief, maar is het niet direct. De Amerikaanse economie lijkt op het moment namelijk net iets té sterk. Dat vergroot het risico op terugkerende inflatie. Ook dit feit zorgde voor een negatief sentiment op de markt de afgelopen dagen. Daarom is het economische nieuws wat morgen op 15 januari naar buitenkomt ook zo interessant om in de gaten te houden. De U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) geeft namelijk belangrijke inzichten over de prijzen in de Verenigde Staten. Deze belangrijke inflatie-indicator bepaalt voor een groot gedeelte hoe de inflatie ervoor staat en of de Amerikaanse FED dus meer of minder renteverlagingen zal doorvoeren.  Verwacht dus wat volatiliteit op de cryptomarkt aankomende woensdag. Beste crypto om te kopen in 2025? Dat de cryptomarkt op het moment door een correctie heen gaat, betekent niet dat er geen kansen meer bestaan. Sterker nog, voor crypto traders met een langetermijnvisie zijn dit vaak de momenten om goed in te slaan. Nu koop je veel coins immers met een korting. Het zal een kwestie van tijd zijn voordat de beste crypto, waaronder Bitcoin, weer een bull run maakt naar een hoger prijsniveau. Toch is Bitcoin in onze ogen niet de enige coin met veel potentie in 2025. Daarvoor moet je iets beter zoeken en op de hoogte zijn van beste crypto presales. Presales zijn momenten waarop de beste crypto voor het eerst verkocht worden. Deze coins zijn dus nog niet beschikbaar op grote exchanges als Coinbase. Dat betekent dat jij er als eerste bij kunt zijn en later, als de coin beschikbaar wordt voor de massa, goed kunt verdienen! Hieronder hebben we drie presales met de meeste potentie voor je op een rijtje gezet. Wall Street Pepe – Beste crypto met meme potentieel Het succes van meme coins is in de crypto wereld alom bekend. Laten we als voorbeeld $PEPE erbij pakken, een meme coin die ondertussen al een marktkapitalisatie van $6,8 miljard heeft opgebouwd! Echter, wat gebeurt er als je een meme coin mixt met het potentieel om actief veel geld te verdienen? Dan krijg je Wall Street Pepe, een meme coin zoals we hem nog niet gezien hebben. Het doel van $WEPE is om riskant handelen, zoals we ook hebben gezien in de Wolf Of Wall Street, actief te stimuleren. Zo verdien je onder andere extra $WEPE als de community jou trades uitkiest als beste trade! Maar dat is nog niet alles. Je trade namelijk niet zomaar. In plaats daarvan vertellen de ontwikkelaars van de coin in de geheime community je precies wanneer je de coin moet kopen! Zo neem je het op tegen bijvoorbeeld de hedge fund manager uit dit artikel. Vervolgens marketen zij de coin aan de buitenwereld, stijgt de prijs razendsnel, en verkoop jij een gedeelte van je $WEPE weer met winst. Zo manipuleren ze de markt dus in jouw voordeel! De reden dat ze dit zo doen is omdat ze bij $WEPE een hekel hebben aan grote crypto traders. Deze community is er daarom om kleine crypto traders zoals jij en ik rijker te maken. Ondertussen heeft de presale al $47 miljoen opgehaald dus het zal een kwestie van tijd zijn voordat deze community een gigantisch succes gaat worden en jou rijk gaat maken! Nu naar Wall Street Pepe Solaxy – Beste layer-2 crypto Memes zijn natuurlijk leuk, maar de cryptowereld heeft het meeste baat bij projecten die de financiële wereld daadwerkelijk vernieuwen. Gelukkig is Solaxy zeker zo’n coin! We praten hier namelijk over een layer-2 oplossing voor het populaire Solana netwerk. Solana was vorig jaar het snelstgroeiende netwerk en wist maar liefst 7600 projecten toe te voegen! Dat Solana zo populair is komt doordat het snel én goedkoop is. Dat maakt het perfect voor het maken van meme coins. Toch zijn er ook veel DeFi applicaties die op dit netwerk worden gebouwd. Het probleem is echter dat Solana ook last heeft van netwerkcongestie én mislukte transacties. Daardoor lopen veel DeFi ontwikkelaars tegen problemen aan. Solaxy lost deze problemen op. Doordat het ook gebruikmaakt van het Ethereum netwerk is dit netwerk snel, goedkoop en heeft het geen last van netwerkcongestie of mislukte transacties. Het gevolg: dit is hét netwerk voor DeFi applicaties. Het zal dus een kwestie van tijd zijn voordat DeFi ontwikkelaars naar dit netwerk overstappen. Dat zal positief uitpakken voor de koers van $SOLX, de native token van het platform. Immers, hoe meer applicaties gebruikmaken van $SOLX, hoe hoger de vraag naar $SOLX zal zijn, hoe sneller de prijs zal stijgen. Dit is dus het moment om onderdeel te worden van een unieke layer-2 oplossing die het landschap van gedecentraliseerde financiën gaat vernieuwen. Nu naar Solaxy Best Wallet – Beste crypto ecosysteem Het crypto ecosysteem wat ze bij Best Wallet hebben ontwikkeld is indrukwekkend te noemen. Hier vind je namelijk een crypto wallet, een gedecentraliseerde exchange én een debit card met 8% cashback. Zo kun je jouw coins dus veilig beheren, nieuwe coins kopen of omwisselen, en ze uitgeven. Het doel van Best Wallet is om in 2026 40% van de crypto wallet markt veroverd te hebben. Ze zijn hard opweg om dit voor elkaar te krijgen. Zo hebben ze op het moment als honderdduizenden gebruikers op iOS en Android. Maar goed, hoe kan jij profiteren van deze groei? Door $BEST in je portfolio op te nemen! $BEST is de native token van het Best Wallet platform. Deze coin geeft je verschillende voordelen. Zo krijg je lagere transactiekosten en toegang tot een grote hoeveelheid exclusieve presales. Daarnaast kun je de coin staken voor een rendement van 265% per jaar! Hoe meer mensen van Best Wallet gebruik maken, hoe harder de prijs van $BEST zal stijgen. Dit is dus het moment om in te stappen! Nu naar Best Wallet",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"SOL koers op randje 22% correctie, bearish druk neemt toe – wat gaat Solana doen?",2025-01-14 10:03:04+00:00,"Solana (SOL) is deze ochtend weer aan het klimmen, ondanks een sterke toename in bearish druk. De koers is in een week tijd met 20% gedaald, maar is vandaag weer 3,4% omhoog geschoten naar $186,70. Kan Solana zijn belangrijke support rond $183 behouden of zal een rejection leiden tot een daling? In het geval dat Solana verder stijgt, kan hij uit een downtrend breken die sinds het eind van november speelt. Hiervoor zal SOL echter eerst opnieuw boven $200 moeten breken met een stijging van 7%. Solana herstelt van daling naar laagste niveau sinds 6 november Solana is gisteren zo laag gegaan als $170, het laagste niveau sinds 6 november. Op die dag schoot de crypto markt omhoog na de overwinning van Donald Trump. De scherpe daling liet zien dat Solana veel momentum heeft verloren. De de sterke support geeft juist aan dat nog niet alle hoop verloren is. Na toename van bearish druk leek een verdere daling voor Solana aan het begin van de week onvermijdelijk. In de onderstaande analyse is te zien dat Solana rond $165 een nieuwe accumulatie-zone heeft. De analist voorspelde hier een bounce, wat vandaag (tot zover) te zien is. #SOLUSDT 1H ANALYSIS Price for #SOLANA has reached a very critical decision point! If price cannot find recovery from the current zone to higher levels, then it is bound to go lower to find more buyers around 165$ support zone. Either way, with the current market conditions,… pic.twitter.com/gN8v9ivvIl — Crypto Master ( Futures/Spot ) (@master_binance) January 12, 2025 Maar zoals eerder gezegd, is de stijging van deze ochtend nog niet genoeg om uit de downtrend te breken die zich sinds november afspeelt. En door de stijging van $170 naar $187 zit de kans erin dat de koopdruk toeneemt vanuit short-term holders. Wat gaat Solana doen? De Solana koers is sinds het einde van november gedaald en bevindt zich voor het grootste deel van afgelopen twee maanden in een trading range die nu tussen $180 en $210 ligt. Het niveau rond $210 dient dan mogelijk als extra resistance, maar een stijging hierboven maakt een breakout boven de downtrend mogelijk. SOL heeft gisteren meerdere support levels getest, zoals de 200-daagse moving average (blauw) op $173 en de onderkant van de trading range op $180. Ondanks de bearish druk, lijkt het nog steeds lastig om de koers onder $170 te duwen, tenzij de crypto markt instort. De Relative Strength Index (RSI) van 42 geeft aan dat Solana weinig momentum heeft, wat het lastiger kan maken om door resistance levels te breken. De eerstvolgende resistance ligt op het huidige niveau van $188, gevolgd door de 30-daagse moving average (geel) van $197. Mogelijk zien we vandaag welke kant Solana opgaat. Een lichtpuntje is het feit dat we nog 6 dagen verwijderd zijn van de inauguratie van Donald Trump. Dit kan zorgen voor veel hype rondom crypto, waardoor SOL een extra duwtje in de rug kan krijgen. Alternatieven voor Solana De crypto markt lijkt voor nu weer op te fleuren. Zo is Bitcoin al 4% gestegen in de afgelopen 24 uur, na een doorbraak boven $96k in de ochtend. Dit is positief voor de hele markt, die over het algemeen beter presteert als het goed gaat met de grootste cryptomunt. Kleine cryptomunten die veel aandacht weten te trekken van investeerders, profiteren het meeste, want een kleinere influx van kapitaal kan zorgen voor grote stijgingen. Hieronder kijken we naar 3 opkomende crypto projecten met een lage market cap en potentie om veel te stijgen in de komende tijd. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Meme coins kunnen binnenkort ook een comeback maken. Een stijging van 7% voor Dogecoin hint erop dat investeerders nog niet hun vertrouwen hebben verloren. De nieuwe Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) heeft ook veel aandacht gekregen van investeerders en met zijn presale al meer dan $47,7 miljoen opgehaald. Een mogelijke reden dat $WEPE een van de grootste presales is van de afgelopen periode is dat $WEPE een meme coin is die veel utility biedt. Token holders kunnen winst maken als $WEPE stijgt, maar krijgen ook toegang tot een exclusieve community met elite trading inzichten. The strength of Wepe is in every hand that holds it. 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/Z8M3bsxTwf — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 13, 2025 Wall Street Pepe is nog voor een vaste lage prijs te koop van $0,00036647 per token, maar deze prijs stijgt in zo’n 24 uur. Vroege investeerders krijgen de mogelijkheid om hun tokens direct te staken, voor een APY van nog 27%. Nu naar Wall Street Pepe Solaxy ($SOLX) Solaxy ($SOLX) is wellicht het beste alternatief Solana, omdat het de allereerste Solana Layer-2 blockchain is. Niet alleen heeft dit concept veel hype opgewekt, ook heeft Solaxy een veel lagere market cap dan Solana. Dat terwijl het wel kan meeliften op het succes van de grote altcoin. Als Layer-2 profiteer je met Solaxy nog steeds van de lage transactiekosten en hoge snelheden, maar dan zonder de kans op storingen of mislukte transacties. Daarnaast is het mogelijk om met $SOLX te investeren in projecten die op de nieuwe blockchain gelanceerd worden. Als toegangssleutel tot de nieuwe blockchain, kan $SOLX erg waardevol worden. Daarom is de huidige presale prijs van $0,0016 mogelijk erg laag en is het niet gek dat de presale al $10 miljoen heeft opgehaald. Koop en stake $SOLX vandaag nog voor een APY van 343%. Nu naar Solaxy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) De Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale is een unieke kans om de utility token van Best Wallet voor een vaste lage prijs te kopen.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,4 of the Best Altcoins That Might Skyrocket if Solana ETFs Launch in 2025,2025-01-14 09:53:13+00:00,"As the crypto market buzzes with growing institutional interest ($DOGE’s price has more than doubled since the elections, for instance), the potential launch of Solana ETFs in 2025 may open doors for massive growth for several altcoins. Solana has emerged as a fierce rival of Ethereum thanks to its low transaction fees and high scalability. Investors are lining up to buy Solana, which has resulted in a price increase of over 300% in the last two months alone. It’s currently priced at $186.52. And this momentum should be amplified by the launch of ETFs. For fellow crypto traders and investors, we’ve shortlisted four of the best altcoins that are all set to benefit from Solana’s potential ETF launch. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First-Ever Layer-2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) is designed to enhance liquidity, speed, and multi-chain interoperability on Solana. It benefits from the high-performance infrastructure of Solana, supporting seamless liquidity pools and fast swaps. This altcoin has raised an impressive $10M during presale, which reflects the strong confidence of investors in its vision. Currently priced at $0.0016, it offers a significant upside potential. As Solana continues to expand into institutional finance through its upcoming ETF, $SOLX is likely to ride this growth trajectory. Solana can process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. This makes it a preferred choice for DeFi and enterprise applications. With $SOLX being integrated into this ecosystem, it’s positioned as a key player for investors looking for exposure to Solana. 2. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Empowers Retail Traders with Unique Market Insights Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and influencers alike with its serious ambitions. This altcoin brings a fresh twist with its community-driven ecosystem that engages users with innovative features. The project powers several decentralized applications (dApps) and rewards users when they engage with its ecosystem. Furthermore, $WEPE investors will get unique market insights often reserved for whale investors. Simply put, it aims to even the playing field and empower the average Joe. $WEPE also boasts gamified staking options. As a holder, you can earn passive income while participating in its vibrant community activities. The presale has raised over $47M, which demonstrates the strong interest in its playful approach. As Solana ETFs move closer to approval, $WEPE is poised to gain further traction. It’s currently available at just $0.00036647, with prices set to increase in the next couple of days. 3. Bonk ($BONK) – Proven Performer to Get a Boost The first dog-themed coin on the Solana blockchain, $BONK, is revolutionizing the concept of community-driven cryptocurrencies. This altcoin was launched in December 2022 and carries the ethos ‘for the people, by the people.’ 50% of $BONK’s total supply has been airdropped to the Solana community. This strategic move significantly enhanced its visibility and led to a 34% rise in $SOL’s price in just 48 hours. $BONK was designed to bring back liquidity to the Solana-based DEXs. However, its broader mission is to create a full-fledged ecosystem where all participants have an equitable chance to contribute and benefit. The uniqueness of the project lies in its airdrop mechanism, which significantly rewarded collectors, developers, and artists across the Solana network. This initiative has increased trading activity, with Orca, Solana’s DEX, reporting a trading volume of $20M. $BONK had grown over 2,000% within a week by January 2023, which made it the top-performing crypto asset in terms of percentage return that year. Currently, the tokens have over 350 on-chain integrations from various verticals. As the launch date of Solana ETFs approaches, $BONK will ride the momentum, emerging as a key force in the Solana ecosystem. 4. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – One of the Most Popular Meme Coins Pudgy Penguins is a meme coin inspired by the popular NFT project that shares the same name. Since its launch in late 2024, it has been gaining traction. This altcoin combines the playful essence of its NFT with Solana’s efficient blockchain infrastructure. Pudgy Penguins has established itself as a favorite among community-driven projects. Currently, it has a market cap of $2.06B, which reflects $PENGU’s rapid surge in popularity. Analysts also consider its influencer partnerships and the growing trend of Solana-based meme coins to be key drivers of this demand. $PENGU’s future largely hinges on market sentiment and how it engages with the Solana ecosystem. The launch of the Solana ETF is likely to further drive the momentum of this promising meme coin. Verdict – Where There’s Reward, There’s Risk While these 4 of the best altcoins are undoubtedly poised for massive returns, it’s always advisable to do your own research before investing your money into them or any other asset class for that matter. After all, the crypto market has its fair share of ups and downs, and you must be prepared for it all. Also, remember that none of the above is financial advice, so you need to DYOR before investing in cryptocurrencies.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,L’intelligenza artificiale prevede il prezzo di XRP per il 31 gennaio 2025,2025-01-14 09:42:59+00:00,"Dopo un 2024 caratterizzato da un trading laterale, sempre sotto la soglia di 1 dollaro, XRP ha vissuto un rally esplosivo all’inizio di novembre, complice l’effetto Trump. L’asset ha sfondato la barriera dei 2 dollari, superando le performance di molti altri asset. Il picco è stato raggiunto il 2 dicembre, quando XRP ha toccato i 2,71 dollari, ma da allora ha perso parte dello slancio. XRP ha continuato a registrare una certa volatilità, con episodi come il rapido crollo sotto i 2 dollari il 20 dicembre. Nonostante il forte slancio iniziale di novembre, il token non è riuscito a mantenere la spinta rialzista. Al momento sta scambiando al livello di 2,53 dollari, con un rialzo del 3,80% in 24 ore. Nel grafico settimanale rimane in positivo con un guadagno del 3,94%, mentre in quello mensile del 5,28%. Gli sviluppi previsti per questo mese potrebbero influenzare in modo decisivo l’andamento di XRP. Domani, 15 gennaio, la SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) presenterà la sua memoria di apertura nell’appello contro Ripple, un passaggio fondamentale per l’esito della battaglia legale. Inoltre, il 20 gennaio Donald Trump assumerà ufficialmente la presidenza degli Stati Uniti, mentre Gary Gensler, il tanto criticato presidente della SEC, lascerà il suo incarico per fare spazio a Paul Atkins, noto per la sua posizione favorevole alle criptovalute. Tutti questi fattori potrebbero avere un impatto notevole sulla traiettoria di XRP. Per capire come potrebbe evolversi nei prossimi giorni, abbiamo consultato l’algoritmo avanzato di PricePredictions, una piattaforma che analizza i movimenti del mercato crypto, per scoprire a che livello potrebbe arrivare XRP entro la fine del mese. L’AI prevede un rialzo per XRP   L’algoritmo, tenendo conto di tutti gli sviluppi, prevede un trend rialzista per il token di Ripple. Secondo l’AI, l’asset potrebbe arrivare a 2,70 dollari entro la fine di gennaio. Si tratterebbe di un aumento di circa il 7% rispetto al prezzo attuale. Le previsioni si basano su un’analisi tecnica approfondita, che prende in considerazione diversi indicatori per valutare la forza delle tendenze in corso e determinare se l’asset sia in una fase di ipercomprato o ipervenduto. Tra questi strumenti, troviamo la divergenza della media mobile di convergenza (MACD), l’indice di forza relativa (RSI) e le bande di Bollinger (BB). Nel lungo termine, le previsioni sono ancora più ottimistiche: secondo l’intelligenza artificiale, XRP potrebbe superare la soglia dei 3 dollari a metà febbraio. Prevede anche una correzione nel breve termine, che potrebbe influenzare temporaneamente lo slancio rialzista. Anche diversi analisti prevedono un rialzo di XRP nei prossimi giorni. Ad esempio, il 12 gennaio Alan Santana ha condiviso la sua analisi, presentando un grafico di consolidamento che lo ha portato a ipotizzare un rally fino a 2,70 dollari, a condizione che si sviluppi uno slancio rialzista nel breve periodo. Ma l’analista è più ottimista rispetto all’intelligenza artificiale. Secondo Alan Santana, l’asset potrebbe proseguire lo slancio e raggiungere il livello di 2,90 dollari nelle prossime settimane. Anche l’esperto di trading The Great Mattsby ha rilasciato una previsione rialzista per XRP, stimando che l’asset potrebbe toccare a breve nuovi massimi storici (ATH) sopra la soglia dei 2,70 dollari.   La sua analisi si basa sui ritracciamenti di Fibonacci, una tecnica ampiamente utilizzata per individuare i punti di inversione e le possibili nuove tendenze del mercato. Anche se le analisi tecniche prevedono un possibile rialzo per XRP, è cruciale considerare fattori esterni che potrebbero influenzare la sua traiettoria. Il recente dump di 690 milioni di dollari di XRP da parte di Ripple rappresenta un evento significativo che potrebbe innescare una pressione al ribasso nel breve termine, offuscando le previsioni degli esperti più ottimisti. Alternative a XRP Nel frattempo, mentre XRP continua a guadagnare slancio, molti investitori stanno diversificando i loro portafogli per cogliere nuove opportunità nel settore crypto. Progetti come Wall Street Pepe, attualmente in prevendita, stanno attirando molta attenzione. Wall Street Pepe sta costruendo una community esclusiva, denominata $WEPE Army, che offre ai titolari del token l’opportunità di accedere a segnali di trading, strategie vincenti e consulenze specializzate. I membri della community possono anche partecipare a gare settimanali di trading, creando così un ambiente competitivo e stimolante. Ogni aspetto del progetto è pensato per supportare i piccoli investitori, aiutandoli a comprendere meglio il mercato crypto e a cogliere le opportunità di guadagno. $WEPE non è solo una meme coin: è un progetto che offre segnali di trading avanzati, una community attiva e un sistema di ricompense per lo staking. Grazie a questa combinazione, il progetto sta attirando l’interesse degli investitori. Finora Wall Street Pepe ha raccolto più di 47 milioni di dollari nella prevendita.        ",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025,2025-01-14 09:30:55+00:00,"Demand for US Bitcoin ETFs has significantly increased as we enter 2025, signifying a notable reversal following a lackluster start to the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350,000? Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction Based on recent figures from Glassnode, net inflows for the week ending January 6 amounted to 17,567 BTC, equivalent to around $1.7 billion. This increase surpasses the weekly average inflows of 15,900 BTC documented in the final quarter of 2024 and indicates a resurgence of investor enthusiasm. A Turbulent Journey Of Inflows Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have shown an erratic pattern. These inflows showed notable fluctuations in late 2024. In September, there was a significant decline as Bitcoin prices dropped below $64,000, leading to large withdrawals. Nevertheless, things began to change by October. Inflows increased dramatically; in few weeks, they topped 24,000 BTC. With the average weekly inflow settling at around 15,900 BTC, the increase continued into November and December, demonstrating the high demand for Bitcoin investments. After a slow start to the year, demand for US spot #Bitcoin ETFs has normalized. In the week of January 6, inflows reached 17,567 #BTC ($1.7B), which is slightly higher than the weekly average of 15.9K $BTC ($1.35B) from October to December 2024: https://t.co/0Cpfm8lpak pic.twitter.com/u4FksOSLuZ — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2025 As the price of Bitcoin increased, so did ETF inflows. In December 2024, the most popular digital asset in the world reached a record-breaking high of $108,135. This association suggests that as more people switched to exchange-traded funds, investors’ confidence in Bitcoin’s worth grew, leading to a positive market sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs: Who Possesses The Most? The total holdings of US spot Bitcoin ETFs as of early January 2025 are approximately 1.13 million BTC. Grayscale has 204,300 BTC, Fidelity holds 205,488 BTC, and BlackRock has 559,673 BTC, making it the largest holding. In 2024, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) garnered attention by accumulating $37.25 billion in assets during its inaugural year, securing the third position on the Top 20 ETF Leaderboard for that year. This significant surge highlights the rising institutional demand for cryptocurrency-backed financial solutions. Will 2025 Be A Good Year For ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs look like they will do well in 2025. Experts in the field think that this year there may be a lot of new, innovative offerings on the market. There will be at least 50 new bitcoin ETFs this year, according to Nate Geraci of the ETF Store. These will cover a wide range of strategies, such as covered call ETFs and Bitcoin-denominated equity ETFs. Furthermore, there is conjecture that Bitcoin spot ETFs may soon exceed physical gold ETFs in asset size. This would represent a pivotal advancement in the development of digital assets as conventional investment instruments. Such a change would highlight a rising confidence in Bitcoin as a valid store of value and investment tool, therefore challenging the long-held view of gold as the best hedge.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Slips Under $91,000 As Crypto Inflows See 56% Decline",2025-01-14 08:00:31+00:00,"Bitcoin has continued its bearish price action as on-chain data shows the inflows into the cryptocurrency market have seen a sharp decline recently. Cryptocurrency Capital Inflows Have Seen A Notable Drop Recently As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have slowed down over the past month. Capital enters (or exits) the digital asset market through mainly three asset classes: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the stablecoins. It’s only once that inflows have made it to these coins that they rotate out into the altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here? Thus, the flows related to these assets could be assumed to represent the netflows for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. As for how the flows can be calculated, the Realized Cap indicator can be used in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Realized Cap is an on-chain capitalization model that determines the total value of any given asset by assuming that the real value of any token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. The last transaction of any coin is likely to be the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at that time would denote its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all tokens in the circulating supply, it essentially measures the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum capital netflows can be equated with the changes taking place in this indicator. For stablecoins, there isn’t any need for this model as their price is always fixed around the $1 mark, so changes in their combined market cap serve as a sufficient method for finding capital flows. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day flows related to the three asset classes over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the total netflows related to the cryptocurrency sector have been positive during the last few months, implying that a net amount of capital has been coming into the various assets. The 30-day inflows appear to have peaked last month, however, as they have since been following a downward trajectory. In this period, the metric’s value has declined from $134 billion to $58 billion, representing a decrease of more than 56%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? “This points to a significant reduction in investment activity,” notes Martinez. The slowdown in capital inflows could be why Bitcoin and other assets have switched to a bearish trajectory recently. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly fell under the $91,000 mark earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since retraced back above it as its price is now trading around $91,800.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin und Ethereum: Verluste gegenüber der Vorwoche,2025-01-14 06:56:54+00:00,"Mit Blick auf die vergangene Woche bleiben Bitcoin und Ethereum im roten Bereich: Gegenüber der Vorwoche sank der Preis des Bitcoin um 7 Prozent, Ethereum um 14 Prozent. Geht es im Laufe der Woche wieder bergauf oder befinden sich die Nummer 1 und Nummer 2 laut Marktkapitalisierung in einer Abwärtsspirale? Bitcoin schwächelt Am 6. Januar durchbrach der Bitcoin wieder die 100.000 US Dollar-Marke und stieg auf über 102.000 US Dollar, dennoch konnte sich die Kryptowährung nicht über der psychologisch wichtigen Unterstützungsmarke halten. Am 9. Januar lag der Bitcoin bei unter 92.000 US Dollar – in Minus von rund 10.000 US Dollar in drei Tagen. Zum Wochenstart ging es abermals nach unten, doch bei 91.000 US Dollar begann sich der Bitcoin zu erholen und liegt nun wieder bei 94.000 US Dollar. Der Relative Strength Index, RSI, liegt derzeit bei 45. Da der Wert unter 50 liegt, wird eine anhaltende Abwärtsdynamik signalisiert. Der MACD Indikator zeigt ebenfalls ein bearishes Crossover. Das ist ein typisches Verkaufssignal, sodass man davon ausgehen muss, dass der Preis des Bitcoin weiter fallen könnte. Schafft es die Kryptowährung aber, sich wieder über der 100.000 US Dollar zu positionieren, könnte es abermals in Richtung des am 17. Dezember 2024 aufgestellten Allzeithochs gehen: Damals lag der Preis der Kryptowährung bei über 108.000 US Dollar. Sieht man sich die historischen Daten an, könnte es im Februar den nächsten Bullenrun des Bitcoin geben. Fällt der Preis der Kryptowährung unter 90.000 US Dollar, könnte das mitunter die Chance eines neuerlichen Einstiegs darstellen. Ethereum steht (wieder einmal) unter Druck Gegenüber der letzte Woche ist der Preis von Ethereum um knapp 14 Prozent gefallen – von 3.660 US Dollar ging es in Richtung 3.000 US Dollar, doch die Unterstützungslinie hat gehalten. Wichtig wäre, dass Ethereum den Widerstand von 3.730 US Dollar durchbricht – derzeit befindet sich Ethereum bei 3.180 US Dollar. Derzeit liegt der RSI bei 40 – es ist also eine ganz klare Schwäche zu erkennen. Die Zeichen stehen hier also ebenfalls auf Korrektur. Der MACD hat das Verkaufssignal verstärkt, da auch hier ein bearishes Crossover entstanden ist. Ethereum scheint auch zu Jahresbeginn unter Druck zu geraten. Der seit Monaten prognostizierte Ausbruch und die damit einhergehende Kursexplosion auf über 5.000 US Dollar wird wohl abermals verschoben werden müssen – doch die Experten sind noch überzeugt, dass Ethereum im Jahr 2025 ein neues Allzeithoch aufstellen wird. Wie geht es jetzt weiter? Während Bitcoin und Ethereum unter Druck geraten sind und es mitunter Signale gibt, die darauf schließen lassen, dass eine Korrektur nicht mehr unmöglich erscheint, ist die Frage berechtigt, wie es mit dem Kryptomarkt in den nächsten Wochen und Monaten weitergehen wird. Tatsache ist: Kryptowährungen befinden sich im Aufwind und Korrekturen gehören dazu, sind sogar notwendig, damit die Preise wieder steigen können. Zudem profitieren auch noch im Presale befindliche Projekte. Unter anderem Flockerz. Wobei Investoren bei Flockerz schnell sein müssen: Der Presale endet demnächst – wird FLOCK, der Token des Projekts, dann auf einer offiziellen Kryptobörse gelistet, wird der Preis wohl durch die Decke gehen. Hier geht es zur Homepage von Flockerz Flockerz befindet sich in der finalen Phase Flockerz ist ein neues Projekt, das sich bereits seit September 2024 im Vorverkauf befindet und diesen Tagen beendet werden wird. Die Besonderheit an Flockerz und dem Token FLOCK? Es gibt einen community-zentrierten Ansatz. Flockerz will sich so von der bereits sehr starken Konkurrenz absetzen und mit dieser Vorgehensweise ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal schaffen. Des Weiteren hofft man, auf lange Sicht den Kryptomarkt positiv verändern zu können. Während nämlich bei fast allen anderen Meme Projekten die Entscheidung nur von einer Person oder einem kleinen Kreis getroffen wird, hat die Community bei Flockerz das Sagen. Die Investoren des Projekts nehmen an Abstimmungen teil und geben in weiterer Folge also den Weg vor, wie es mit Flockerz weitergehen wird. Damit die Community wachsen kann und stärker wird, hat man den Vote to Earn-Mechanismus geschaffen. Das heißt, nach der Beteiligung bekommt der Investor auch noch Token gutgeschrieben. Ein weiterer Anreiz, um aktiv zu sein. Des Weiteren können die Token namens FLOCK auch nach dem Kauf gestaked werden. Derzeit liegt die Rendite bei über 300 Prozent. So will man verhindern, dass nach dem Listing auf einer Kryptobörse der Ausverkauf stattfindet. Wer also plant, in das neue Projekt Flockerz zu investieren, der sollte daher unbedingt die offizielle Plattform aufrufen und direkt über die Entwickler die Token beziehen. Noch läuft der Presale. Im Januar wird dieser aber beendet werden. Danach wird man FLOCK auf offiziellen Kryptobörsen finden, muss aber davon ausgehen, dass dann der Preis deutlich höher als während des Presales ist.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In,2025-01-14 06:30:55+00:00,"After reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of over $108,000 in December 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) has declined more than 15%, currently trading in the low $90,000 range. While bulls fear a further drawdown to $85,000, some analysts remain optimistic, suggesting that the premier cryptocurrency could rebound and potentially top out in the summer of 2025. Bitcoin To Top In Summer 2025?  According to crypto analyst Dave The Wave, BTC may peak in the summer of 2025, around the middle of the year. The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin’s price trajectory is likely to continue appreciating, as indicated by the 52-week simple moving average (SMA). Related Reading: Trump-Fuelled Bitcoin Rally May Fade Ahead Of January FOMC Meeting: Report Dave the Wave emphasized Bitcoin’s historical adherence to the logarithmic growth curve (LGC), a model that has successfully outlined BTC’s price movements over time. Notably, BTC tends to reach its peak when the 52-week SMA touches the midpoint of the LGC channel. The analyst explained: The suggestion of a mid year btc peak here: price has previously peaked when the one year moving average hits the midway mark of the LGC channel. For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin LGC is a model that tracks the cryptocurrency’s price over time on a logarithmic scale, smoothing out its extreme volatility to highlight long-term trends. It uses upper and lower bounds to indicate potential support and resistance levels, helping analysts predict future price movements within a broader growth trajectory. The following chart illustrates how BTC prices have historically peaked a few weeks or months before or after the 52-week SMA intersects the middle line of the LGC channel. For instance, BTC’s $69,000 ATH in November 2021 occurred months after the 52-week SMA signaled the potential peak in May of the same year. Based on this trend, Bitcoin could peak within a few months before or after the 52-week SMA crosses the LGC midpoint, which is currently projected to occur in July 2025. This prediction aligns with other forecasts that see BTC reaching $200,000 by mid-2025. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bitcoin Munger has pointed to the substantial buy walls between the $85,000 and $92,000 price levels on Binance’s order books. The analyst expressed confidence that “$110,000 is coming either way,” regardless of whether BTC briefly dips into the mid-$80,000 range. Is The BTC Price Correction Nearing Its End? Crypto trader Rekt Capital believes Bitcoin may be nearing the end of its current price correction, which typically lasts 2–4 weeks. In an X post, the trader noted that since this correction is now in its fourth week, a rebound could be imminent. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Hit $1.5 Million By 2035 According To Metcalfe’s Law, Analyst Predicts Similarly, crypto investor Daan Crypto Trades compared the current BTC price action to the December 2023–January 2024 period. Using the same price fractal, Daan predicts that BTC could find support around $86,000 before recovering its losses and surging to a new ATH of approximately $110,000. That said, there are still concerns about a potential bearish head-and-shoulder pattern forming on the BTC chart, which may push its price all the way down to $80,000. At press time, BTC trades at $91,427, down 3.7% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from X and TradingView.com",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,solana,Are bots dominating Solana validator staking? Is it fair to validators?,2025-01-13 14:34:33,"Looking at Solana’s proof-of-stake system and seeing people raise some real concerns about bots influencing validator rankings. For example, I saw how the banana gun bot works - it automates staking decisions to maximize rewards by quickly moving delegations between validators giving higher yields.  
  
While this seems efficient and easy to use (esp by new users), it does raise some questions about fairness and the meaning of decentralization in the first place. If bots like this can dominate, smaller validators will always have issues in attracting enough delegations, leaving control concentrated with larger, more popular validators. This could hurt the network’s decentralization in the long term, no?  
  
If anyone knows more about how much of an impact bots actually have on validator rankings, I'd love to hear about it. And what would be the measures you can take to make it fair to all validators?",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

When experimenting, I found that I only receive data for transactions that are explicitly displayed as swaps on Solscan. But transactions that are labeled as ""Interact with Instruction"" (e.g., commission\_spl\_swap2) are not being sent, even though these are also swaps.

I configured the webhook to listen for ""any"" transactions, but this didn’t work either. It seems like only explicit swap transactions are being recognized and sent by Helius.

Could anyone explain how exactly Helius defines a swap transaction, under what conditions they are counted and sent, and if there's something I might be missing or doing wrong? I’m relatively new to this and would appreciate any insights. Thanks!",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

i track list of KOL on gmgn.ai and see them all buy and sell immediately after few minutes, to get 50-200% profit and can lost 99% investment in few minutes.

Know that to evaluate your risk, dont be get farmed by them.
it gamble game, no value at all. Who run last will lost all money. 

I used bot copy trade and with large volatile even slippage 30% cant sell at that time , bot keep failing. And then I lost all money with that coin.

After that, the platform said they couldn’t support the transaction and explained that it was because I sent USDT using the wrong network (meaning I lost the money and couldn’t recover my assets).

Can someone explain this to me? I don’t understand why the platform can’t recover the funds, considering Wormhole is a protocol on Sol, and my transaction is recorded on the blockchain (Solscan).

Reddit,solana,"Pump.fun or FluxBeam and Raydium?
",2025-01-12 03:17:09,"Hi Everyone,

Myself and a group of colleagues have started a project that we are wanting to compliment with a solana based token, but can't decide whether to just launch on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) or go the *slightly* more technical route and use FluxBeam (using a helpful guide found on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/194x5zz/guide_how_to_create_and_launch_your_own_meme_token/)).

The obvious plus to pumpfun is that they take care of the liquidity but the downside is you're essentially a memecoin and never going to be anything but (we can probably live with this label and look to market ourselves differently online).

I believe (correct me if I am wrong) setting up with FluxBeam and adding liquidity via Raydium would give us more more control over the token, especially if we want it to function as a utility token) but is slightly more technical.

The main reason for the post was to get some steer on liquidity and drumming up organic trading (outside of the marketing we would be doing). If anyone can help with the following questions I would be incredibly greatful!

\- If we setup with FluxBeam and add liquidity ourselves, how much is the 'suggested' amount? To avoid snipers and bots draining us? Is 15 Sol too little?

\- Would this method also make the pairing available to view on DexScreener fairly quickly?

\- Given how many new coins are launched on pumpfun, is it almost harder trying to stand out on there than trying to market a fresh coin not created on pumpfun?

\- Any other advice you have on making this choice is greatly appreciated!",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Fast forward to our launch date: everything was ready - the website, the X account, the Telegram group, visuals, tweets, and a lot of excitement. The concept revolved around a character waking up on Solana as an SPL token, realizing it had switched networks, and having one goal: to return and reunite with his beloved son on Ethereum. But enough about the meme lore.

On December 31, 2024, we launched. The chart looked healthy, with organic growth for some time. However, having all our socials and the website connected to the launch made us a target for malicious actors eager to piggyback on our hard work.

Before we knew it, we bonded and reached a market cap of nearly $200k. Unfortunately, a sniper managed to purchase 46% of the supply. It’s likely they hyped the project further through their own channels (speculating) before dumping their entire position and crashing the chart.

Reddit,solana,BullX fee: how to calculate all fees,2025-01-11 17:01:59,"I have this wallet address I used to test trade: HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w

The fees essentially ate all the profits. Even though eventually I set the buy priority fee to something small like 0.0001 and turned off MEV protection, gigantic fees still were charged.

For instance, I bought 5EYsHuyYGriuoYah7e9FfbSYuGW3vJevHnm2mtnJPfto (15M) and paid these fees:

Create account: -0.02203928 ($4)
Create account: -0.00203928 ($0.4)
Paying the token price to get token from Raydium pool: -0.02 ($3)
Then the token 15M is deposited to token account, and I get 
Close account: +0.00203928 transaction.

I assume this account 
https://solscan.io/account/5QiMQo2nQwkcvj2QcZJVpFSGBgGnXhrgL3vedsVuB6PM#transfers
is being created and closed (within a single Buy transaction).
What I also don't understand, why the Transfers in this account have (+0.02203928) and (-0.00203928), but the balance is zero? Shouldn't 0.02 be left?

Then I pay another fee -0.0002 ($0.03) and another -0.002 ($0.39)

I realize that 0.00203928 is the fixed Solana fee for opening a token account (https://solscan.io/account/2fKFFfY9BYBECReK2PNgqe6UhxHhrTg7x9jYjGvWrh1H), but I have two Create account transactions, I assume one of them (the one with -0.02203928 fee) is made by BullX?


These are all transactions, from the first Buy to the last Sell of the token:

https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736344500000&time=1736345300000#transfers

For selling I only paid -0.00203928 to Create account, and -0.000261668 transfer fee, and -0.001 Jit fee (maybe didn't have MEV turned off for selling?)

Another example, buying and selling MLG Doge token: https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736286500000&time=1736286690000#transfers

To Buy I paid -0.02203928, -0.00203928 to create account. -0.0002 and -0.002 transfer fees. Essentially around $5 in fees just to Buy. For selling it's -0.00203928 create account fee, -0.000248179, -0.002, -0.0001 transfer fees.

Looks like the initial 0.022 accounts for the majority of the fees, what is that thing?

At the same time, when I first buy Emma token (BznQ5VeNfJVY94KdMByFPNH7Ri9qTLWCHMLfcd6Rpump, transactions: https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736350580000&time=1736639999000#transfers), I only pay -0.00203928 fee to create account (a single create account transaction). Before, when I was selling tokens, I would get - token and + WSOL, but with Emma, I only have -193,848.691919 token transaction and now +WSOL following it, like usual. I go on to buy more of it +225,960.354818 and sell later -225,960.354818, but no +WSOL transactions at all.

Reddit,solana,Educational Blog Post | Solana Token Accounts Made Simple: Why Should You Close Them? (Written by RayBot intern),2025-01-09 20:06:53,"**Source:** [https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9](https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9)

On Solana, associated token accounts (ATAs) are essential for managing tokens. But what happens when you no longer need a specific token account? That’s where the “close token account” transaction comes in. Let’s explore why and how you might close an ATA, and the benefits of doing so.

[https:\/\/t.me\/ray\_magenta\_bot](https://preview.redd.it/mrlvvwoqy0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8063f79b43829bc5d71e8607c2639023379f0acb)

# What Does It Mean to Close an Associated Token Account?

Closing an associated token account is like cleaning out a locker at the end of the school year. Once you’re done using it — say, you’ve sold all the tokens — you can “close” the account. This deletes the account and refunds the rent (SOL) used to maintain it.

>

# Why Close an ATA?

There are a few key reasons you might want to close an associated token account:

1. **You No Longer Need It:** If you’ve sol all the tokens and don’t plan to use that token again, closing the account cleans up your wallet.
2. **Save on Rent Costs: Each account you maintain uses a bit of SOL. By closing unused accounts, you can reclaim those funds.**

# How to Close an ATA

There are many tools that can help you close ATA accounts. Here’s how it works:

1. **Ensure the Account Is Empty:** Before closing an account, make sure it has a balance of 0. You can do this by transferring or selling any remaining tokens to another wallet or account.
2. **Use a Cleanup Tool:** Use one of the well-established tools to close your accounts. For instance, go to [Sol Incinerator](https://sol-incinerator.com/#/) (one of the most popular tools for wallet cleanups) and select “CLEANUP.” It will display all your vacant accounts. There are other tools offering the same functionality — do your own research (DYOR).

https://preview.redd.it/mrxz7f3ty0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=687739690238d0d2723a92bc1eae88dad67364bf

The “close token account” transaction is a simple yet powerful tool for optimizing your wallet on Solana. By closing unused accounts, you save money, keep your wallet organized, and contribute to the overall health of the network. Whether you’re a casual user or a developer, understanding and utilizing this feature can make a big difference in your Solana experience.

So next time you spot an empty token account in your wallet, consider closing it — your SOL balance will thank you!

We launched [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) in early 2024 with the goal of empowering developers to compete, experiment, and build products across a broad spectrum of crypto use cases through our online hackathons. In partnership with the Solana Foundation and numerous ecosystem organizations, we’ve built the largest hackathons in crypto and helped accelerate the rapid growth of Solana’s startup ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/f6354joq01ce1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf37ffc7659f232fb0275d195c444222b7040756

Following each major Solana hackathon ([Renaissance](https://www.colosseum.org/renaissance?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Radar](https://www.colosseum.org/radar?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), we accepted two accelerator batches each with 10+ winning teams. And to date, we’ve made pre-seed investments in 20+ startups. Reviewing thousands of hackathon submissions and working with talented founders in our accelerator program has given us an up close view of crypto's rapidly emerging markets. As the year comes to a close, we’re excited to share our perspective on 12 high-growth verticals where we saw exciting development in 2024, and that we believe will continue to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. In addition, we highlight the hackathon winners and teams we’ve backed who we believe are creating the markets that will drive each category forward.

*Note: Many of the projects mentioned below are currently on devnet, with mainnet deployments expected in Q1 and Q2 2025.*

**Non-Sovereign SoV Assets**

Over the past decade, Bitcoin has proven that a non-sovereign store-of-value (SoV) asset can gain global acceptance and secure a core position within the global financial system. While Bitcoin’s incredible success validated the concept, we believe it also opened the door for additional digital gold-like assets to reach escape velocity and meaningful liquidity in the coming years.

[Ore](https://x.com/OREsupply?ref=blog.colosseum.org) stands out as the most promising non-sovereign asset tailored specifically for onchain ecosystems. Strong community support, thoughtful economic design, and increased liquidity—fueled by “Boosts” on key trading pairs—[positioned Ore well in 2024](https://x.com/mattytay/status/1870887900663169059?ref=blog.colosseum.org). We’re excited to see the core team use these structural advantages to build new products that further its adoption in the broader onchain economy.

**Futarchy**

DAOs have long struggled with governance, often relying on 1-token-1-vote structures that can stifle progress, resulting in a waste of both human and treasury capital. MetaDAO offers a transformative “[futarchy as a service](https://metadao.fi/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)” framework, enabling organizations to make decisions through markets rather than traditional voting mechanisms.

[MetaDAO](https://x.com/MetaDAOProject?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is already integrated into leading projects like Drift and Jito. We believe futarchy will continue to solidify itself as the default governance module in the Solana ecosystem (and crypto more broadly) in 2025—one that overcomes entrenched governance challenges and accelerates dynamic decision-making.

**Decentralized Stablecoins**

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT have achieved widespread adoption, and crypto-native products such as Ethena are also on the rise. However, existing stablecoin implementations often sacrifice censorship resistance, capital efficiency, or both.

A new wave of experimentation is underway, with the aim of creating stablecoins that offer robust stability while also delivering more decentralization, transparency, and higher yield potential. [Reflect](https://x.com/ReflectCX?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Hylo](https://x.com/hylo_so?ref=blog.colosseum.org) represent two of the most promising protocols leading the decentralized stablecoin renaissance in 2025.

**Crypto’s Growth Stack**

As consumer-facing products begin to dominate venture funding in the Solana ecosystem, the need for sophisticated growth tools will increase in lockstep. Just as Web2 startups have grown up around powerful analytics and marketing tools, Web3 builders are now developing their own data-driven growth engines to meet their unique needs.

[Torque](https://x.com/torqueprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is one such product, providing a powerful onchain-native growth platform, enabling just-in-time user rewards based on a wide variety of behaviors. Prominent teams like Tensor and Metaplex already use Torque for targeted growth campaigns. Meanwhile [AdX](https://x.com/AdXso_?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team in our latest accelerator cohort, is building a decentralized ad exchange, granting both Web 2 and Web 3 projects direct access to effective distribution channels.

**High-performance Clients**

Currently, Solana’s network relies on two main node clients: Anza’s Agave and Jump’s Firedancer, the latter of which hasn’t been fully deployed yet. The Firedancer team has taken on the ambitious (and critical) effort of building a new client from the ground up, with a focus on high-performance. While we believe this will be a successful effort over the coming years, we also believe there are sustainable opportunities for monetizing more tightly-scoped validator improvements even sooner. 

[Rakurai](https://x.com/Rakurai_io?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team of experienced engineers from Apple and high-frequency trading, are capitalizing on one such opportunity. Building on upcoming Agave releases, their validator client will integrate an optimized transaction scheduler that has benchmarked at up to 5x the current block rewards and yield boosts of over 30% compared to existing clients. We anticipate a continued increase in competition amongst validator operators, leading to better network performance for apps and users in the years to come.

**Crypto Developer Tooling**

As crypto matures, development teams require increasingly advanced tooling to secure, monitor, and scale their products. In traditional tech, tools like HashiCorp’s Terraform made cloud infrastructure management far simpler and more reliable for engineers. In crypto, [Txtx](https://x.com/txtxrun?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is poised to offer similarly transformative infrastructure—improving security, reliability, and reproducibility of workflows involving onchain programs/smart contracts.

For monitoring and rapid bug resolution, [Tokamai](https://x.com/gotokamai?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has also emerged as a crypto-native equivalent to Sentry, empowering developers to maintain application reliability through every layer of the stack.

**Onchain Yield**

While DeFi has introduced overcollateralized lending, capital-efficient yield remains elusive. The next phase of DeFi will bring more sophisticated yield markets onchain, enabled through true prime brokerage-like functionality and liquid staking fundamentals.

[Asgard](https://x.com/asgardfi?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is laying this groundwork by building a suite of DeFi protocols, including a spot margin aggregator and credit synthesizer. [Pye](https://x.com/pyefinance?ref=blog.colosseum.org), another hackathon winner, is creating a marketplace that allows stakers to tokenize and forward-sell their staking yield—further extending the frontier of DeFi 2.0.

The final team we backed in this vertical is [Watt](https://x.com/wattprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is building a volatility farming protocol utilizing market arbitrage to generate real yield for users and foster liquidity for the ecosystem as a whole.

**Private DeFi Infrastructure**

Transparency is a defining feature of DeFi, yet certain market participants prefer selective privacy. PayPal’s integration of confidential transactions using token extensions for its PYUSD stablecoin highlights a growing demand for privacy-enhanced financial infrastructure.

We believe this foreshadows in a new era of embedded privacy primitives for DeFi. [Darklake](https://x.com/darklakefi?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a recent hackathon standout, employs zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy-first dark pool trading platform.

**Sports Markets**

Sports are rapidly financializing: stadiums are integrating casinos, online betting is thriving, and college athletes are now receiving substantial compensation. Crypto is poised to expand and democratize these markets—enabling direct ownership, unique betting models, and new forms of engagement.

In our newest accelerator cohort, [AlphaFC](https://x.com/alphafcxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is pioneering the tokenization of sports fandom through real ownership of an English football club, and [Pregame](https://x.com/pregame_hq?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is building a new platform for direct p2p sports betting. We're excited to watch both of these endeavors expand crypto’s role in the sports economy.

**Virtual Infrastructure Networks**

DeVINs (Decentralized Virtual Infrastructure Networks) gained momentum in 2024 and we continue to see top founder talent launch a diversity of products in the space.

[BlockMesh](https://x.com/blockmesh_xyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) empowers users to earn passive income by leveraging their unused bandwidth, and is well on their way to building a strong network with over 500,000 extension downloads.  Meanwhile, [MeshMap](https://x.com/meshmapxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is focused on building a 3D AR mapping network. Although mainstream AR/VR adoption is still in its infancy, we anticipate accelerated growth in these areas over the next 1-2 years. Finally, we also backed [DBunker](https://x.com/Dbunker_Network?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is an aggregator and marketplace giving users the ability to participate across many DeVINs.

**Energy Markets**

Rising global energy demand and increasing climate pressures create volatility and opportunity. Southeast Asia, in particular, has seen high demand for innovative solutions to support a growing population with an aging energy grid. We’ve backed 2 India-based teams who are building novel token-incentivized infrastructure to serve this demand.

[DeCharge](https://x.com/DeCharge__?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has deployed over 150 EV charging stations within just a few months, and is expanding to the U.S. in Q1 2025, and [GreenkWh](https://x.com/GreenKWh?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is using battery packs to coordinate off-grid energy—both projects exemplify how crypto can reshape global energy infrastructure.

**Social Markets**

After a 2024 boom in memecoins, founders are now exploring deeper integrations of social media, token issuance, and gaming. The following teams are exploring use cases across a spectrum of community engagement to gamified token economies:

* [Banger](https://x.com/bangerdotlol?ref=blog.colosseum.org): An app that enables users to buy and sell “tweet tokens,” Curators to profit from high-volume tweet markets, and Creators to earn for their viral posts.
* [Peek](https://x.com/peekdotcyou?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A platform that leverages liquid crypto markets to gamify TikTok videos and content.
* [Supersize](https://x.com/supersizegg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A Mini-clip style gaming platform building an onchain PVP game where token communities wager and compete for dominance to become the largest “blob” on the map.
* [Monsters](https://x.com/monsdotgg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A new game for memecoin communities, blending Pokémon-inspired mechanics with high-stakes betting.
* [Teamplay](https://x.com/teamplay_games?ref=blog.colosseum.org) (with Midcurve): A platform for creators to host private gaming sessions and contests, tightening community engagement and opening new revenue streams through a token-enhancing toolkit.

**Looking Ahead**

As we prepare to run more hackathons for the Solana ecosystem in 2025, we’re eager to learn from the next generation of founders and support the creation of novel crypto markets. One emerging force we’re closely examining is AI weaving its way into crypto landscape. While we don’t view AI as a standalone use case, we do see it as a transformative layer that will enhance all verticals.

Reddit,ethereum,noob question about ethereum & coinbase,2025-01-11 22:01:18,"TL;DR: This stuff is confusing and I'm about to waste your time.

Let me tell you a tale of my ethereum adventure...

I saw something I could buy with ETH and figured hey, great time to finally get my feet wet with crypto -- as much for the learning as the end result. So I set up a coinbase account, connected my debit card, and bought $100 of ETH. Then coinbase was like ""you can now spin the wheel for a free gift!"" so I click the button and it says ""you are not allowed to spin the wheel"" or some shit. [edit: I know this sounds like I clicked an ad for a gambling site but it was just a silly promo offer for new accounts - not the end of the world for them to fail to fulfill it, just smells bad] Which leads me to find a bunch of reddit threads of people enraged at coinbase for poor service and support. Okay, well that's a good excuse to learn how to set up my own wallet. Not ready to get into hardware just yet, so I install metamask and create a wallet.

I go to coinbase to send my ETH to my wallet and it warns me to make sure that my wallet supports the same network, and I see coinbase uses the Base network, so (first mistake in 3... 2... 1...) I switch metamask to the Base network and do the transfer. In retrospect I think I could and should have switched coinbase to use Ethereum network instead. Didn't realize it stays tied to that network, though I get that now.

But anyway, now I go to the site with the thing I wanted to buy and it says I have to use the Ethereum network. Ugh so I gotta move it over. So I go to metamask and do a ""bridge"" to move my ETH from Base to Ethereum. But it fails... I think because metamask wants to take a service fee and it can only take it from Ethereum network (??) So.. I can't move my ETH to Ethereum because I don't have any ETH in Ethereum!

Okay, back to coinbase to buy another $10 of ETH to put on Ethereum network for the fee. But I already spent the $100 debit limit, so I add a paypal account and buy $10 of ETH, which turns out to be $9.75 cause this time they charge me a quarter for some reason.

Now to transfer my new ETH to my wallet on Ethereum network. BZZZT NOPE. Funds are ""Unavailable"" for 10 DAYS because clearing/security/blah/blah. Since when it does take 10 days to clear a $10 paypal transfer WTAF.

So now what? Looks like I could add my bank account directly for another funding source, but my appetite for connecting things to coinbase is waning rapidly. I could look into another exchange.. Binance? Kraken? But are they really any better?

If you've actually read this far, I'm interested in any thoughts. Does coinbase just suck or is this par for the course? Is there a different way for me to move my ETH from Base to Ethereum that doesn't require already having ETH in Ethereum?

Thanks!",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Developers: Help Build a Proof of Existence DApp & Blockchain,2025-01-11 21:50:22,"Hey fellow developers!

I'm embarking on a project to build a decentralized application (dApp) focused on **Proof of Existence**. This dApp will allow users to securely and immutably record the existence of digital or physical assets on a blockchain.

**Key Features:**

* **Secure Hashing:** Implement robust hashing algorithms (like SHA-256) to create unique fingerprints of user files.
* **Blockchain Integration:** Integrate with a suitable blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana) to store these hashes securely and transparently.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to upload files, generate hashes, and record them on the blockchain.
* **Timestamping:** Incorporate timestamping mechanisms to provide verifiable evidence of when the file existed.
* **Data Privacy:** Explore privacy-enhancing techniques (like zero-knowledge proofs) to protect user data while maintaining the integrity of the proof.

**Tech Stack (Open to Suggestions):**

* **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, or similar
* **Backend:** Node.js, Python (with frameworks like Flask or Django)
* **Blockchain:** Ethereum (with Solidity), Polygon, Solana
* **Smart Contracts:** Develop smart contracts to handle hash storage, timestamping, and potentially access control.

**I'm looking for developers who are passionate about:**

* Blockchain technology and decentralized applications
* Secure coding practices and cryptography
* User experience and interface design

**If you're interested in contributing to this project, please reach out!** I'm open to collaboration, code reviews, and any other forms of assistance.

**Let's build a secure and transparent Proof of Existence solution together!**",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

How does this address consistently chosen through RADAO? What am I missing something here?

Reddit,ethereum,development around etherium ecosystem,2025-01-11 09:08:52,"Hello friends.  
My question may be duplicate but I don't have much time, I literally googled single time and there was not good answers so I decided to ask directly without any deep searchs so sorry for that.

last 3 month I got interested in blockchain technology and started learning. It was very interesting to learn architectural design behind some of them. ( I touched mostly bitcoin, ether and solana).  
At this moment I want to dive deeper in etherium so I need some guidence and advice where to start learning all the development concepts around it. I have experience of software development, mostly in gambling and banking domains ( I am just telling that because I don't want courses that explain for loops or something like that) .",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Now, it's a test program. I used it to get to know nethereum.

  
Now After I got signedTransaction, I want to test if signedTransaction is legit.

How do I do so?

I tried to make a script that automatically checks for the balance, but the fastest I could achieve is 12 seconds.

Why am I asking this? I found a private key (it was the txhash from a testnet, and I was curious to see if it would work as a private key). The address I discovered is constantly receiving small amounts of ETH (0.0000000...) and instantly transferring them to another address. I searched for the address, and all the results pointed to crypto scams. A few people who got scammed mentioned that their funds somehow ended up at the address I found.

Reddit,ethereum,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-09 13:11:10,"Hey folks, happy new year. This was popular on r/ethdev, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT***\*: They just extended the application deadline to January 11th, so I’d apply ASAP if interested\*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

LMK if you have any questions, the team or I can try to give more info.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,ethereum,Staking with DVT- Options?,2025-01-09 19:22:31,"Staking is a fundamental part of the new Ethereum ecosystem, focused on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where users can earn rewards while participating in securing the network.

  
However, the growing centralization of power in the hands of a few institutional entities has raised alarms for quite some time about the risks this poses to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum blockchain network.

For this reason, today the integration of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) in staking offers a more resilient and decentralized alternative that addresses concerns about the deficiencies in traditional centralized staking platforms.

  
Options?:

\* Obol

\* Diva Protocol

They’ve apparently tried to refund me to my external wallets, and both of their attempts have failed. These are two different wallets on Ethereum that both support the token.

Anyways yhe article was from 2 years ago or so. Some big brain and was actually very cool and informative (almost certain it was published on Medium). The cover image stuck with me though

Title was something like:

Ethereum is like a space colony // defi is like a base on mars // web3 is like a space station

I tried searching a bunch of alternatives. Idea was that all these separate moving parts make up this cool ecosystem like a space colony. Maker was in it, Uniswap, other big protocols had their own little base or building and thing were connecting. I think newer protocol was landing it’s ship and plugging in

Pretty sure is was specifically about Ethereum and not all of defi/web3.. but throwing it out there it could have been. The colors of the cover were light and similar to general EF tones.

Been searching for days and can’t find, hopefully someone remembers the actual article (cause I’d like to re-read it as well as reference the cover lol)

**What it is:**

A simple tool ([Satosh.me](http://satosh.me)) that gives you a clean profile page (satosh.me/yourname) to organize and share your Ethereum addresses professionally.

**Key Ethereum Features:**

\- Support for ETH and all ERC-20 tokens

\- Clean way to share different addresses for different tokens

\- Support for ENS domains

\- Track which addresses are being engaged with

\- Dark mode interface (because Web3)

**Why I built it:**

\- Managing multiple addresses for different tokens was getting messy

\- Needed a professional way to share addresses with clients/community

\- Wanted analytics on which addresses get used

\- Tired of copying/pasting addresses from different places

**Technical Details:**

\- No custody of private keys

\- Just manages public addresses

\- Built on Next.js/React

\- Simple dashboard for address management

Everything's free for basic use, with a Pro tier for advanced features (30-day trial available).

Live at: [satosh.me](http://satosh.me)

**I'd especially love feedback from the Ethereum community:**

1. What other Ethereum-specific features would be useful?

2. Any ENS integration ideas?

3. What kind of analytics would be most valuable?

Looking forward to your suggestions on making this more useful for the Ethereum ecosystem!",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

I’m a blockchain developer specializing in smart contract security. I’m offering comprehensive audits to help teams secure their projects before deployment or scaling.

Here’s what I bring to the table:

* **Vulnerability Reports:** A detailed assessment of your project and report of potential risks and a classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
* **Fix Recommendations:** Clear, actionable guidance to resolve issues, optimized for frameworks like Solidity, Rust, PyTeal, and more.
* **1:1 Support:** I work closely with teams to ensure every vulnerability is understood and addressed.

If you’re building on platforms like Ethereum, Algorand, or Polkadot, I’d love to assist in making sure your project is secure and ready to grow.

Feel free to DM me or comment below if you’d like to learn more or discuss any specific security concerns. Even if you don’t need a full audit, I’m happy to answer questions or share advice on best practices.

Cheers

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks

Edit: Thank you mods and this community. Your answers have been insightful and will lead me to researching more.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept 3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

I wonder if one day Vitalik will be remembered as one of the greatest economic innovators of our time",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

Reddit,ethereum,Running ethereum node in Evernode,2025-01-02 05:50:54,"Hello,

I’m attempting to run an ethereum node on Evernode (evernode.org) by deploying the Docker version ethereum/ethereum:latest.

So far, I haven’t had any success. I suspect the issue might be related to the port configuration required for the node to communicate with the outside world. Do you have any tips or guidance?

You might be wondering why I chose Evernode for this. The idea of running a blockchain participation node on a platform powered by another blockchain (Evernode) is fascinating, and the pricing is incredibly low compared to other VPS options.

Thanks in advance!",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

Please ask any questions you may have!  We have our next public goods funding round beginning January 11th.  To learn more about Octant, join our discord: [https://discord.com/invite/octant](https://discord.com/invite/octant) ",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
Reddit,ethereum,Calculating network fee,2025-01-03 10:06:41,"Can anyone please tell me how to reliably calculate the network fee at any given time?

I've used etherscan gas tracker and used the current gwei to calculate the price, but it is out by a factor of 100 from what I am quoted by CoinBase.

21000 \* 8 = 168000 = 0.000168 ETH = £0.49

CB total cost = £40 / £20 of this is network fee

I simply just do not understand how to calculate this fee or the total cost and CoinBase aren't much help.

Reddit,ethereum,The Next Upgrade and Global Adoption 2025,2025-01-02 05:29:45,"##**Tech and upgrades coming in 2025**

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,20 years old and have finally attained a whole bitcoin ,2025-01-13 20:08:54,"As the title said it.. I’ve been in this space for 3 years and have started with around 10k as a whole in deposits within crypto and have finally scaled it up to a point where I have attained 1.5BTC. I swapped it and have plans to keep it in my cold wallet for a day of either emergency.. or a day where crypto becomes adopted worldwide and BTC is the driver of heart behind it all.

If I’m being honest, I am glad i have finally attained this goal of mine and I really am using this as a step to get away from this toxic space. I’ve seen my fair share of cabals.. rugs.. degeneracy..scams and pure stress in this space. I am finally committed to now spend this free time I used to have spending hours in charts and telegram groups, to now finally spending some time with my family and focussing on my career.

Im currently at the point where I have stopped all trading or charts for the past month, but I always have the thought of me wasting my skills and past 3 years I have in this space. Am I going with the right path here on banking on the fact that 1.5BTC will one day be life changing in 8-10-15 years from now? 

I have thought about optimising my wealth and savings from now into tax free stocks accounts and just spending money weekly DCAing into index funds until I’m 40.. all whilst focusing on my job as a junior electrician. 

Im hoping to gather any opinion or thought you guys may have that you would like to share on my situation.

There are a few grammatical differences and a different download link for the Bitcoin program, but other than that, the message is the same. 
21 million coins and no more. 

The fun thing about this sourceforge announcement is that it appears to have been forgotten. The record for it is not accounted for by The Nakamoto Institute, The Book of Satoshi, or even Kicking The Hornets Nest

Perhaps it should be added to the Satoshi history books. Makes you wonder what other forgotten digital artifacts are out there.

As exciting as it is to be right and to see BTC top 100k and be implemented into traditional finance with ETF, company, and country balance sheets I can’t help but wonder what it will feel like when a major drawdown comes. 

Every time is different .. until it’s not. BTC has fell 93% … 84% … and 77% from all time highs over each for year cycle (roughly). Who will have strong hands when the time comes? Who is mentally prepared? 

From holders who have been through this in the past what is your advice to stay in the game psychologically while watching your network shrink drastically. 

Personally I plan to DCA over the next 4 years and buy heavily when I feel the cycle low is in and wait for better days. Good luck to everyone and let’s enjoy the rest of this bull run. Bitcoin is still the life boat that saves your buying power for the future and gets you out of the fiat matrix. This is why we HODL 📈",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Four years ago, at 21, I started asking a simple question: What actually is money? That question pulled me down the rabbit hole. When I realized—holy shit, the system has lied to me about money—it made me wonder: What else have centralized authorities lied to me about?

That curiosity led me to question the religion I was raised in, which led to experimenting with psychedelics for spiritual growth, which led me to redefine God for myself, which led to deeper independent thinking across all aspects of life. And now, looking back, I see that it all started with that one question: What is money?

The orange pill is more potent than I ever imagined.

Reddit,bitcoin,Stolen Bitcoin Full Story,2025-01-14 03:52:18,"Mods removed the last post where I expressed frustration after finding my hardware wallet had been compromised and the funds removed from my account.

For education purposes I feel obligated to post the full story after further investigation for others to see where my mistakes may have occurred and for others to hopefully learn from my life's lessons.

Here are the events as they occurred and the most likely points of compromise:

1# Purchase of Ledger Nano X from Ledger website Black Friday 2020

2# Opening new Segwit address 2022 on Ledger Nano X and moving funds 11/17/2022. Private keys stored in physical fire proof vault. The key to the vault stored in a hidden second vault. There private key was coded on a sheet of paper in a puzzle sequence and a final backup photo was stored on a phone (**Vault app**)

3# **Ledger Nano X goes missing** after cleaning people clean house some time in (2023). Mind you ledgers policy is to wipe the physical device after 3 failed attempts to login which I can assure you was 99.9% certain based on the unlock code I used at max length with no relevance to me.

4# Purchase of Jade wallet from online electronic retailer via **ebay.** The Jade wallet was in original shrink wrapping with tamper stickers in place. The Nano X seed phrase was then recovered on the new Jade wallet to be stored in a physical vault now (2024)

5# I go to check the device usually every 6 months to find the funds have been extracted without any physical device confirmations on my side 1/11/2025

Attached photos so you can see the evidence and unfortunate events  
I do take extra safety precautions and store my funds through 6 different locations but this was a large chunk of funds that I will have to swallow.

I am unable to determine which point of failure caused the compromise but I obviously believe the physical stealing of the ledger device or the purchase of the Jade was ultimately my undoing.

Reddit,bitcoin,Intro to investing as a 17 year old. (Struggle),2025-01-14 00:29:08,"I’m asking for guidance in my introduction to crypto/ investing. 

I’m tired of being broke and I won’t be broke when I grow up.

Currently I’m 17 1/2 years old, I’m a senior in high school, and I turn 18 in June. Ever since I was in eighth grade, I had dreams of investing, only I was never old enough. I’m still not old enough. I always figured my parents would not let me use their id to start early and today I figured out that they wouldn’t let me. 

My dad thinks I’m gonna put all my money on bitcoin and “throw it away.” But I have a feeling that if I don’t invest soon I’m gonna miss out on potential gains. Little do my idiotic parents know that if they put like ten bucks into bitcoin 14 years ago, only a couple years after I was born, it would increase by almost 130,000,000%. And my mom and dad probably would not be working their shitty jobs that they are now and be doing something else. 

I have some shitty part time job a Burger King and I’m trying to make some extra money by investing some of my money that I just have laying around. They want me to go to college to be an engineer, but I would rather do something else. I would prefer to go to a technical college to start working on getting my cdl, and learn to work on diesel engines. Then I could start doing private loads and make some decent money off that. 

I’m no genius, but I’ve noticed things my parents do that are just stupid. Like almost every day there’s some stupid thing that happens that has me like, “how could you not realize that / figure that out?”
They’re so dumb sometimes that it pisses me off. Like now. It makes me want to move out. I cannot wait till I’m 18 and have some freedom.

The part that pissed me off even more is that they think I’m an idiot and treat me like one because I don’t talk to them much cause it’s unbearable. 

So finally, what’s the best way to invest and make money as a minor, so I can gtfo this place as soon as possible. ",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

I wanted to share something I’ve been struggling with lately. I’ve always been a very reward-oriented person, which has played a big role in my food addiction and other impulsive behaviors. Saving money has never come easy for me, and now I’m finding that the same impatience is affecting how I approach investing in Bitcoin.

The idea of waiting years to accumulate a significant amount of satoshis feels almost unbearable to me. It’s hard to stay motivated when the rewards are so far in the future, especially when I can’t shake this severe anxiety about life’s unpredictability—like the fear of dying early and all my saving and waiting being for nothing.

I guess I’m looking for advice or even just reassurance from others who’ve felt the same way. How do you stay patient and focused when the payoff feels so distant and uncertain?

Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading.

Some additional information:

The idea was to run a full node on a Pi 4/5 and have it sit on my desk. So it must be passive cooled to be silent. Unfortunately I didn't find a case that met my high design requirements so I cnc-machined my own from aluminum. 

My requirements:
The Pi 4 and 5 have their USB-C and Ethernet ports on different sides so cables stick out in various directions which doesn't look great. Furthermore I wanted to utilize a NVME SSD and have the entire setup cooled passively.

Components:
- RPI CM4 (CM5 wasn't out mid 2024)
- Waveshare CM4-IO-BASE-C board
- 1 TB M2 NVME SSD
- CNC-machined aluminum case & lid
- thermal pad
- screws, studs, bumpers, small parts

Super happy with the result.
Looks great and is absolutely silent.
Cost approximately €400.

Reddit,bitcoin,"What Does Being ""Orange-Pilled"" Exactly Mean?",2025-01-13 00:03:01,"I read a lot of posts and comments on this sub about being orange-pilled, but never saw a clear explanation of what it exactly means, so I came up with my own criteria. In my opinion, an individual should meet 4 criteria:

1) Read about the history of money and understand why Gold was the best currency

2) Accept the fact that government fiat money is manipulated against us via dilution and inflation

3) Start the journey of being a Bitcoin Maxi

4) And most importantly, NEVER CASH OUT OF BITCOIN. Even at $100M a coin.

Let me be clear on the fourth point. It's fine to BUY things with Bitcoin, like a house or a business, or to spend it on your daily living expenses, but not to sell and convert a significant amount to fiat money. 

What does being""Orange-Pilled"" mean to you? I'd like to hear from other Bitcoiners.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
Reddit,bitcoin,Are there Bitcoin prediction markets where the base currency is Bitcoin?,2025-01-13 20:44:43,"I was listening to a recent Swan Bitcoin podcast and getting very bullish.

So for example if the odds for bitcoin to hit $250000 this year were 2:1 you would wager 0.1 bitcoin but receive 0.2 if it hits that, not 2 x the dollar value of 0.1 btc at the time of the bet.

I have a position of about 70% in FBTC and wanted to dump my 2025 contribution into it as well. Well, I just got a call from my advisor who tells me LPL wont approve the trade because my portfolio already includes too high a percentage of BTC ETFs. Wouldn't let me put it into a different BTC ETF either... Yet, when I asked, I was told there are no rules for accounts that are heavily invested into a single stock such as Apple. Just the crypto ETFs. So I told them to put it in MSTR instead. I dont like being told what I cant do with my money and its time to look into moving my account until self management at Fidelity.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The rCryptoCurrency Moon Week 57 Moon Burn Update + 500 Moon Giveaway,2025-01-13 20:49:48,"  
Welcome to the Moon Burn Update for Moon Week 57. In this post we'll take a look at all Moon Burns between December 9th and January 5th[.](https://imgur.com/a/10Jb44H) We'll also review the total number of Moons that were burned in 2024 look at how that impacted circulating supply, and at the very end we've got a giveaway (yes you can skip straight to the end).

# What are Moons:

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub. [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors on  as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit. (make sure you comment for a Moon Tip)

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days, with [Moon Week 57](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hww4fq/moon_week_57/) happening right now!

# Let's talk Moon Week 57 Moon Burns:

Between December 9th and January 5th:

* 220 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in five unique burn events:
* 20,864 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum One ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in four unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is: 21,084 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Moons are the 12th most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum One with \~125k Moons haven't been burned so far on Arbitrum One

https://preview.redd.it/u871grxmltce1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb76a37e66f969e0c81b4c3b4a553ac513bb0045

Unlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the sole supply of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned.

\-----

Moons are the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \~2.75M Moons having been burned to date and accounting for over 99.9% of the value of all tokens in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova.

I didn't take any profits and now with alts being slaughtered, I am beating myself up every single day. It's painful.

Is anyone else going through this right now?

And now there is so much fud and people saying alt season already happened. Nobody is certain what January and the next few months will bring.

I started a crypto journal and my first entry is describing to myself how incredibly bummed I feel right now and to not repeat the same mistake: not taking profit if my portfolio rises to a certain level again. Ironically, in the past I have not taken profits dozens of times and seriously regretted it, yet thought I had learned my lesson. Feels like being caught in a vicious cycle that you think you've learned from yet do all over again.

Everyone is racing to find a token that will pump within the next few hours, only to eventually lose it all. The liquidity that should be flowing into good projects is instead getting sucked into these useless AI coins and meme tokens, which offer nothing more than a faster way to gamble and get wrecked.

I have completely lost the ability to look into the new projects and find something worth investing. The CT feed is full of suggestions about these memes and AI agents. For me, the only way to stay sane and make some profits is to DCA into Bitcoin, and maybe a little into some Layer 1s.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,$220.344M Liquidated From The Crypto Market in Last 24 hours,2025-01-13 13:46:13,"What a way to start the week right? With a lot of REKTs. In the past 24 hours, 220.344 traders were liquidated with a total liquidations in $538.86M... The largest liquidation happened on Binance BTCUSDT with $8.21M liquidation.

From the heatmap we can see that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) took the lead in total liquidation volume with $112.69M and $106.20M, respectively. However, Others category that represents altcoins is not getting behind surpassing both with a total of $128.82M. Alts proportionally bleeding more than the big two. Other important alts like SOL, DOGE, XRP are also experiencing significant bleedings.

Even thought I expected a rally looks like the market is priced in the incoming events data like US CPI and maybe other bearish future news that at least I am not aware of.

If you believe in crypto in the long term, you will see this as an opportunity to load a bit more in a cheap price before things get again bullish. I think we are currently getting close to the real bull run and it is not a surprise to see this kind of dumps during January.

Let see what future has saved for us, stay safe, trade safe and don't let the noise and FUD blur your goals.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Coinbase Sucks,2025-01-13 00:59:51,"I will fully disclose that I'm not very ""into crypto,"" however I used Coinbase a bunch about 3 years ago. I had a decent portfolio, got the Coinbase card, and used the 4% rewards a ton. I really was a Coinbase fanboy and loved their interface.

That was until I stayed in a hotel that I paid for with my Coinbase Card, but for some reason the preauth didn't work when I got there and I had to use another card to actually pay. The hotel said they hadn't actually charged the Coinbase Card. I've done this many times at other places and never had an issue. It took 6 months to get the charge ""reversed"" on Coinbase even though the hotel had told me (the many times I called them) that they did not charge the card.

I can't describe how frustrating Coinbase support is. If every page and phone number just said ""fuck you, we hate you"" I think it'd have been a better experience. To their credit, they did eventually reach the correct resolution, but I closed my account out of pure frustration.

That was in 2022, now I need the merchant statement on the card to help prove my location back in 2021. To my horror, the support is even worse now. There is a phone number you can call, and wait hours to speak with someone who can't actually do that much, but they will check that you are still there every 3 mins of the hold. They gave me a statement of *crypto transactions* and told me if I wanted the Card transactions, I'd have to chat. The chat will say ""estimated wait time is over an hour, we'll update in 30 mins,"" but **it took, and I'm not exaggerating, 11 hours to reach an agent.** Even more impressive, they also gave me the same crypto transaction statement, and after an hour and a half of me basically begging them that I just need the Card statement, they said the team that could do that would email it to me in a few days. To my horror, the email they sent had the same fucking crypto statement without the information I needed. I must've spent over 24 hours with these fucking morons.



Anyways, that's my motivation to write this post. I'm sure other people have had much worse situations and been fucked over more.

But if you are a Coinbase user, I hope that you consider the fucking nightmare that awaits you if you ever need to use their support.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Litecoin - Risk, reward and the future",2025-01-14 05:47:52,"Hello Reddit! I have never posted on here before, but for some strange reason I felt like today was a good day to do so.  I'm going to give you some of my thoughts as to why I think Litecoin has a huge potential upside with a reasonably low downside, and why I am comfortably going to hold it for many years to come.



Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin. But for now I'm going to shine some light on Litecoin. I will try to back up as much of this info as I can with links.



For those of you that don't know, Litecoin was the 2nd Cryptocurrency ever created. Widely considered ""Digital silver"" to Bitcoin's ""Digital gold"" because it offers a faster, more accessible alternative while sharing similar foundational principles. It was fairly launched in 2011 with no pre-mine, the total supply is capped at 84 million coins, and the block generation time is approximately 2.5 minutes (unlike BTC's 10 minutes) making transactions faster and more efficient. It has maintained 100% uptime since its inception, running on a PoW blockchain similar to Bitcoin, and is secured by miners using the Scrypt hashing algorithm. Litecoin is ""merge mined"" with Dogecoin and Bellscoin. This means if miners want to mine for DOGE/BELLS, they run miners to secure the Litecoin network, and as a reward they are given Litecoin, with DOGE and BELLS as extras.



As mentioned, the total supply of Litecoin is capped at 84 million coins, which is four times the total supply of Bitcoin at 21 million. This gives BTC and LTC a 1:4 supply ratio. Currently, LTC is valued at approximately $100 per coin, while BTC is priced around $100,000 per coin. This represents a 1:1000 price ratio between LTC and BTC. The disparity between the price and supply ratios is enormous. LTC has room for MANY 100X's to still be a mere fraction of the market cap of Bitcoin..



A large price disparity is to be expected, of course, given that Bitcoin is a more established asset with greater recognition and adoption. But there are signs that LTC is on track to become a GIANT.



Although Bitcoin is the #1 Cryptocurrency as far as market cap goes, Litecoin is THE most popular coin for crypto payments. BitPay, the leading crypto payment platform, recently released its 2024 statistics in this tweet: [https://x.com/BitPay/status/1874881469534937145](https://x.com/BitPay/status/1874881469534937145) , and Litecoin was clearly the peoples favorite. 



LTC was used for 201,165 payments, significantly surpassing BTC with 130,250 payments. ETH followed with 56,365 payments, while DOGE and USDC both saw 32,148 payments each. This is most likely due to LTC's low fees and fast transaction times, which make LTC a much better choice than BTC for payments, LTC has the lowest transaction fee out of all large L1's, which is shown in this post by IntoTheBlock: [https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1878890678895378628](https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1878890678895378628) with the average transaction fee being a mere $0.0051.



Over the last year, the hash rate of Litecoin has absolutely soared as more miners are getting involved, driving up the mining difficulty. Which is an interesting metric, as it's widely believed with Bitcoin, the higher the difficulty, the higher the price. It seems like it could be Litecoin's turn to follow that trend in the near future.



Large institutions have been accumulating LTC heavily as of late.



Fidelity, who manages $12 Trillion in assets overall, has just recently added LTC to their Digital Asset portfolio. They exclusively only offer 3 different cryptocurrencies; BTC, LTC and ETH. In late December they did a report on LTC which can be found through this post: [https://x.com/DigitalAssets/status/1868725284012183712](https://x.com/DigitalAssets/status/1868725284012183712) and they are actually doing a livestream ""Covering Crypto"" today! (Jan 14 - 9a PST / 12p EST) according to this post: [https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1878833210081370199](https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1878833210081370199) 



Grayscale, who is one of the world's largest digital currency asset managers; managing over 18 billion USD worth of assets in their crypto portfolio.. has been consistently scooping up LTC in large quantities. Over the last year LTC has been the coin they have invested the most in, with many occasions where LTC was the only coin they purchased that day. They have managed to accumulate over 2 million LTC as seen here: [https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1865089507877646709](https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1865089507877646709) and their full GBTC portfolio showing their crypto diversification and inflows/outflows can be seen here: [https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale](https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale)  


On top of this, we are beginning to see applications for Litecoin ETF's. On October 16, Canary Capital filed an S-1 for a proposed spot LTC ETF, this can be seen here: [https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1846244273127411859](https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1846244273127411859) . Also on November 25, LTC was listed as an eligible currency for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETC as shown here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2031069/000121390024102164/ea0209567-04.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2031069/000121390024102164/ea0209567-04.htm), in the paragraph ""As of today, based on the Sponsor’s assessment, the following assets meet all eligibility criteria and may be eligible for inclusion: bitcoin, ether, avalanche, chainlink, and litecoin"".



Because Litecoin shares much of the same technology and fundamentals as Bitcoin, it's expected to navigate regulatory challenges smoothly, having already benefited from Bitcoin's precedent. This sets it apart from other large cryptocurrencies, which still face the risk of being classified as securities or encountering similar regulatory hurdles.



According to data from blockchain analyst IntoTheBlock, in December 2024 there was a whopping 370k active addresses, 200k daily transactions, 10b in monthly volume which exceeds the entire LTC market cap, and 78% of all LTC holders have been holding for over 1 year, indicating that many holders are expecting further price growth. As seen here: [https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1866165270387237117](https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1866165270387237117)



One other interesting topic of discussion in the crypto community is the threat of quantum computing. Thankfully, the Litecoin Foundation is actively implementing and upgrading the LTC network, and I have seen discussion about how it would be much easier to upgrade the LTC network to make it quantum resistant in comparison to BTC (I read this somewhere, I can't find the link lol).



One example of the Litecoin Foundations recent innovations is the introduction of a privacy feature to Litecoin. Called MWEB (short for ""MimbleWimble""), this feature provides privacy similar to XMR by completely hiding transaction amounts and participant addresses. This means that users can send private transactions without revealing sensitive details on the blockchain.



In this current climate, there's a lot of crypto projects that are failures, rug pulls, scams, projects that overpromise and underdeliver. LTC is none of the above, LTC has proven itself in so many ways, cemented itself in crypto history.. and it's just getting started.



This thread is getting very long so I might leave it there. I'm sure there's heaps of other cool stuff I could mention, and I've forgotten a lot. But maybe I've taught you something new about LTC and that's cool. 



In conclusion, I'm expecting the disparity between the price and supply ratios of LTC/BTC to creep closer over time. I could be completely wrong. For me (not a psychic), I find it hard to imagine a world where LTC goes much below $50 (-50% from current price), yet there seems to be potential for hundreds of X's. I am happy with this risk/reward, and I will continue to invest for years to come.



\#LTC activity on X has been increasing a lot lately, so there's lots more info you can find there with a quick search.



Excited for the future.

What platforms still trade it?

I need to transfer it somewhere but don't know where... Any ideas?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Those That Know Kaspa and aren't Invested, Why? ",2025-01-14 06:01:20,"From my perspective, Kaspa is the most groundbreaking crypto to come since Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Both revolutionizing aspects of crypto, Bitcoin introducing proof of work to the world and Eth being the first mover on smart contracts.

Now, Kaspa is combining the pros of PoW with Eth's smart contracts, all while being faster than Solana, providing MEV resistance, and fulfilling Satoshi's original vision of BTC as a decentralized peer-to-peer currency with a fixed supply, essentially becoming programmable digital silver!

There are tons of near-term catalysts regarding larger tier 1 exchanges and large institutions like Greyscale as well.

So, what I am trying to figure out is why everyone isn't as bullish on this as I am.

We've never seen an L1 achieve this level of technical breakthrough since btc and eth.

My question to this community:

Is there a way to do this in the crypto world, or a platform that does this sort of thing?

The reason I say that many of you would be interested, is because it involves gathering different groups together that are pushing for fundamental change in our social structure, and that have plans and technologies to make all this come to fruition.

Then I would wait until the coin tanks and transfer back into the coin. I plan on holding for a while so time and money isnt really a problem in the sense of profit. Id rather see a gain in coin itself like seeing the amount owned go up. For example with sol and doge its been consistently moving. Doge has moved to 26 cent up to 40 down to 30 every few days its getting a big change. Would something like this be profitable. I plan for a long time hold on both but just wanna see gains with coin itself like go from 500 dogecoin to 1000 dogecoin even if there isnt that significant of a monetary gain for now. Again, I found a pretty good aggregator so fees arent a huge issue.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,Hashing conundrums,2024-12-20 20:49:23,"I have two questions about hashing that I thought might as well be merged into one post.

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
Reddit,crypto,🔐NIST begins RSA and ECDSA deprecation by 2030,2024-11-23 20:22:19,"
NIST has published draf IR 8547, outlining the national strategy for migrating to quantum-resistant cryptography by 2035.

Before I revisit this project, I plan to dedicate significant time to studying existing implementations and understanding possible attacks. My goal is to ensure that any future contributions I make are both meaningful and secure.

I am sincerely sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. I also want to thank everyone who offered support and constructive feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your understanding.

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Proof of Possession: Does a Schnorr Signature done with the sum of 2 Elliptic Curve private keys prove possession of the 2 individual keys?,2024-10-24 10:57:36,"G is the Generator of a Discrete Log Hard Elliptic Curve Group.

2 Private keys x1 & x2, corresponding Public Keys P1 = x1G & P2 = x2G.

Now P = P1 + P2 is also a public key with corresponding private key x = x1 + x2.

If I sign (Schnorr Signature) with x, does it only prove possession of the private key corresponding to P or does it also prove possession of the 2 individual public keys x1 & x2? Or if not proof of possession of both x1 & x2, does it atleast prove something more than just x?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-14 12:18:46.777729
Reddit,crypto,The quantum computing revolution nobody is talking about.....,2024-10-16 17:18:03,"This is probably more significant than any of these papers coming out of China claiming to break RSA or Gift 64 using a western quantum computer. Scott Aaronson, the consummate quantum pessimist has rather abruptly changed his mind. The man who is famous for debunking claims related to quantum capabilities says: 

To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, *maybe, eventually,* someone will need to *start thinking about* migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack. I think today that message needs to change. I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.
