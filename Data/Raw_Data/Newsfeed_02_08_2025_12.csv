Interestingly, 90% of the country’s crypto volume is linked to stablecoins. Galipolo also expressed concerns regarding taxation and money laundering that come with the excessive use of crypto. Stablecoins are tied to real-world assets such as fiat currencies or commodities and hence are less volatile than altcoins. They act as a like-to-like alternative to paper currencies and have allowed businesses to make easy cross-border payments. As per Chainalysis, Brazilians deposited around $90B in digital assets between July 2023 and June 2024 (12 months). This was only behind Argentina in Latin America, which deposited $91B during the same time. The global volume of stablecoin transfers also reached $27.6 trillion in 2024, which surpassed the volumes of Visa and Mastercard combined. Stablecoin Market Cap Surpasses $200 Billion The global stablecoin market capitalization crossed $200B – an increase of $37B since the appointment of the pro-crypto Trump as the new President of the US. USDT deposits have surged to $43B – up 41% in the last 3 months. A rise in stablecoin volume indicates increasing liquidity in the crypto markets, which is always a positive sign for an upcoming crypto (and Bitcoin) rally. Experts believe the upcoming bull run may be led by stablecoins. The meme coin market saw the most growth throughout 2024, surging by a massive 500% – from $20B to $120B, outperforming any other crypto class. Today, successful meme coins like Dogecoin have a market cap of over $36B. It’s also worth noting that ever since Trump became the president, there has been a massive surge in meme coin activity. He launched his own token called $TRUMP, which quickly rose to $75, generating mind-boggling gains for early investors. It’s now the fourth biggest crypto in the world in terms of market cap. With an influx of new traders into crypto, plus the market moving towards stablecoins and altcoins, the need for a reliable crypto wallet has never been higher. This is where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) comes in. What Is Best Wallet Token? $BEST is the in-house token of the insanely popular Best Wallet App – a decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet that provides you access to more than 60 crypto chains. This allows you to buy, sell, swap, and track all your crypto holdings in one place. Now, the $BEST token is the Best Wallet App on steroids, seeing as it unlocks a lot of benefits for token holders within the Best Wallet ecosystem. For instance, you get access to all upcoming alpha tokens much before they go on sale for the general public. Simply put, $BEST gives you the opportunity to get positioned in the next 100x cryptos early. Plus, all of these tokens are vetted internally by the $BEST team so that you don’t accidentally end up losing money on scam websites. You can find these tokens in the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section of the app. By the way, this is the same feature that helped investors identify gems like $PEPU and $SLAP. What’s more, $BEST token holders also benefit from lower transaction fees on the platform. Furthermore, you don’t need to go through a tedious KYC process to start using the app. This saves you a lot of time and hassle and gets you started on your memecoin investment journey quickly. Check out our detailed Best Wallet review for more info. Why Can $BEST Be the Next 100x Meme Coin? The Best Wallet App looks to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. This translates into a huge $4B in revenue for the company. Here are some more confidence-inspiring numbers for $BEST investors: Within just a few months of its launch, the app now has 250,000 active monthly users and over 500,000 users in total. The month-on-month user base growth sits at a massive 96.3%. The app installation growth was 658% since its launch in November. All things considered, it was hardly a surprise that Best Wallet Token ($BEST) raised $1M within just 14 days of its presale’s launch. It has, so far, raised $9.3M and is quickly heading towards the $10M mark. More good news is that the developers have exciting plans for Best Wallet’s future. These include full Solana compatibility and the launch of Best Card for seamless crypto payments. You can head over to the official $BEST presale website and get it for just $0.0239 each. However, the price will increase in the next few hours, so get in as early as possible. However, always do your own research before purchasing crypto assets, as they can be very volatile. None of the above is financial advice, either, and you can consider consulting a professional financial advisor before investing your hard-earned money.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Next Big Crypto to Invest In as Missouri and Kentucky Join the Bitcoin Reserve Race,2025-02-08 10:46:47+00:00,"Missouri Representative Ben Keathley has introduced a new bill, proposing the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Fund. The said fund would be placed under the control of the Missouri state treasurer, who’d be granted the power to purchase, invest, and hold $BTC using the state’s money. Missouri’s plan is to diversify the state’s investment portfolio. In addition to accepting gifts and donations, as well as taxes (including fees and fines), in crypto, Keathley also wants Missouri to follow a HODL strategy for $BTC. Another US state to have taken a big step forward towards embracing crypto is Kentucky, which has introduced new legislation authorizing an investment of up to 10% of excess state reserves into Bitcoin and other digital assets. By doing so, Kentucky has officially become the 16th US state to have shown interest and/or have introduced legislation for Bitcoin reserves. With Bitcoin (and crypto) adoption to skyrocket in the coming months – and a US Federal Bitcoin reserve looking very likely – thanks to the new pro-crypto Trump administration, here are five projects with the potential to become the next big cryptos. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Overall Best Crypto to Invest in for Massive Returns Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best meme coins going around right now, primarily because it offers a brilliant mix of memeic appeal and real utility. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, $SOLX aims to improve the network by ensuring transactions are carried out more reliably, quickly, and cheaply – all aspects that Solana Layer 1 chains have been struggling with. Another thing that’s unique about Solaxy is that it’s a multi-chain token. It connects two of the most active crypto ecosystems (Ethereum and Solana). This will not only result in a large user base but also offer the best of both, i.e., Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s speed. All things considered, it’s hardly a surprise that Solaxy has become one of the biggest crypto presales, raising over $18.6M at the time of writing.  1 $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001628, and early adopters can also benefit from the project’s 217% staking rewards. Here’s how to buy $SOLX. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Crypto Offering Actionable Market Insights With AI gaining massive traction worldwide and in crypto, there’s little doubt that the best AI agent coin, MIND of Pepe ($MIND), is one of the top new cryptocurrencies to watch out for. Simply put, $MIND is an AI-powered autonomous entity (meaning it has a ‘mind’ of its own) that scans the market and offers early-stage crypto investment opportunities to token holders. How does it do it? It interacts with crypto influencers and communities on dApps and social platforms like X and gauges which way the crypto wind is blowing.  Additionally, $MIND is self-evolving, meaning once it’s armed with all the info and hype floating around online, it can drive conversations and trends, eventually becoming a Roaring Kitty on steroids and churning out one GME after another. The MIND of Pepe presale has been a massive hit; it has crossed the $5M mark in virtually no time at all. You can get $MIND for just $0.0032792 each – here’s how to buy it. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Revolutionary Crypto Project for First-Time Investors Unless you’re a seasoned crypto investor, or even if you are, following the memecoin market can be pretty daunting, let alone churning out consistent profits from it. This is where Meme Index ($MEMEX) comes in. It’s a one-of-a-kind crypto project offering different baskets of meme coins, each with a varying degree of risk, profit potential, and volatility.  You can choose a meme coin basket depending on the kind of investor you are – risk averse or someone more aggressive. For example, the Meme Titan Index is ideal for conservative investors who’d prefer average but steadier returns. On the flip side, the Meme Frenzy Index will appease risk takers, as it contains the next cryptos to explode. Considering the huge influx of new traders in the crypto space, $MEMEX’s less risky approach to memecoin investing is going to have a lot of takers.  You can benefit from its success by investing in its presale, which is currently ongoing and has already raised $3.4M. Each token is available at $0.0159713 – and here’s a guide on how to buy $MEMEX for more info. 4. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – OG Meme Coin Ready to Dominate Once Again Dogecoin is really the perfect example of the potential meme coins have. It was the first-ever unserious crypto, and with a current market cap of over $36B, it’s now the biggest meme coin in the world. Plus, with Elon Musk planning to integrate this dog-themed crypto into X’s payment platform, there’s little debate that Dogecoin could not only follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory but also beat it.  After all, $BTC is up 116% in the last year, whereas $DOGE is up 210%. It’s worth noting that although it has experienced a sizable price decline in recent weeks, $DOGE looks poised for a major comeback.  At the time of writing, Dogecoin is right in the face of a breakout, following which we could see a violent rally upwards. This means the current price of around $0.25 is a great entry point. 5. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Follow the Crypto Man, the POTUS Himself One of the thumb rules of investing is to keep emotions out of it. So, irrespective of your personal opinions on Donald Trump, there’s no denying that his own meme coin $TRUMP is among the most lucrative trading opportunities right now. Official Trump took the crypto market by storm when it shot up by over 12,000% overnight after its launch, making new crypto millionaires with every tick upwards. Although recent price drops may suggest that $TRUMP is no longer the sensation it once was, the token boasts a massive market cap of $3.4B – meaning investors are aware of its potential. With Donald Trump set to catapult crypto into insane new highs, $TRUMP, which is a reflection of his popularity and acceptance among crypto enthusiasts, could be among the biggest gainers in the market. Conclusion The potential of the above-mentioned next big crypto notwithstanding, beware that the crypto market is prone to violent ups and downs, which is why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing.  Also, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must conduct your own research before jumping into crypto.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is The Crypto Market Top Near? Here’s Why There’s ‘Some Runway Left’,2025-02-08 09:30:52+00:00,"After the recent crypto market corrections, some investor’s and market watchers’ bullish sentiment appears to have decreased, with many claiming the top is in. However, other analysts point out that several indicators don’t signal a cycle peak yet, suggesting that the bull still has some gas in its tank. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Could See A 95% Rebound, But It Must Hold This Level – Analyst Crypto Market Capitalization Retests Key Level The crypto market has recently suffered continuous corrections that have halted the momentum from the post-US election. During the November-December rally, the industry achieved many milestones, including Bitcoin’s breakout from the $100,000 barrier for the first time in history. The crypto market also surpassed its 2021 all-time high (ATH), reaching a market capitalization of $3.73 trillion on December 17, 2024. Nonetheless, its recent shakeout sent the total crypto market cap (TOTAL) to its lowest range in nearly three months. On Monday, the market retraced to the $2.8 trillion mark, briefly losing the key $3 trillion support level before bouncing. Market observer Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that the TOTAL chart retested the 2021 ATH during the pullback, turning the weekly candle “into a pretty interesting one.” The trader explained that the $3 trillion mark is crucial to hold going forward despite the chart showing “plenty of demand for the time being.” Meanwhile, the $3.7 trillion mark remains the key resistance level, as it is “what’s in the way of further expansion higher.” Daan also noted that the Altcoins market capitalization, which excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum, swept the 2024 highs and bounced after briefly losing its current range during the market correction, which could suggest that the long-awaited altseason is still ahead. He pointed out that Altcoins might continue moving sideways within their current range, but a breakout could see them test the December highs, as they are yet to break their 2021 ATH properly. Cycle Top Coming In Q4? Analyst Sjuul from AltcryptoGems shared an analysis of the total crypto market chart. The analyst stated that he doesn’t see the “warning signs” other investors and market watchers have mentioned online. From a technical perspective, the crypto market’s rally is a “straightforward support and resistance situation” since flipping the 2021 ATH level, which the market is currently holding. Sjuul compared this cycle to the previous one, stating that it technically is the beginning of the “real bull run.” Timewise, the chart presents various similarities between the two cycles, suggesting the top is around 230 days away. He explains that the 2021 breakout from the previous cycle’s top occurred 1,120 days from the 2017 ATH. Additionally, the 2021 cycle top occurred 1,400 days after the 2017 peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility ‘Relatively Low’ Despite Market Shakeouts – Analysts Eye This Crucial Level Meanwhile, this cycle’s breakout from the 2021 ATH happened approximately 1,120 days after the top, similar to the last cycle. If history repeats itself, this cycle’s timing suggests that the crypto market top is around 7-9 months away. Ultimately, the analyst projected the market peak to occur in Q4 2025 and potentially hit a market capitalization of $4.5 trillion.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Could Fear Fuel Bitcoin’s Comeback? Analyst Spots a Surprising Pattern,2025-02-08 08:00:10+00:00,"Bitcoin price in recent days seems to have dimmed investor’s confidence in the asset for now with the community seeing less buzz as BTC sees fewer green days.  Regardless of this, some analysts are still eager to analyze BTC and its major metric to at least get a perspective on if there’s hope around the corner. An instance is a CryptoQuant analyst known under the pseudonym ‘Avocado Onchain’ who recently shared an insight on BTC focusing on Binance funding rates. Funding rates, which represent the cost of holding long or short positions in the futures market, can provide insight into market sentiment. A decrease in funding rates often suggests growing pessimism, as traders who previously held bullish positions are forced to cover their positions due to mounting losses. This shift in sentiment can have cascading effects, leading to mass liquidations and further price declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility ‘Relatively Low’ Despite Market Shakeouts – Analysts Eye This Crucial Level Binance’s Funding Rates And Potential for Rebound Avocado, has recently examined the implications of Binance’s funding rates in a post titled “Monitoring Binance Funding Rates: Will Bitcoin Rebound After Extreme Fear?” According to the analysis, a notable wave of long position liquidations occurred recently, leaving the market in a state of extreme fear. Funding rates on Binance, a platform known for its large retail investor base, have shown a pattern that may hint at future price movements. Historically, negative funding rates on Binance have been relatively rare, but when they do occur, they have often preceded significant price rebounds. Avocado suggests that this dynamic is linked to the behavior of retail traders, who dominate Binance’s trading volume. When these traders display heightened fear—manifested through negative funding rates—Bitcoin has tended to defy the prevailing sentiment and recover. The analyst also pointed out that during past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has rebounded after hitting negative funding rates triggered by large-scale liquidations. This historical pattern could indicate that, while the current market environment appears grim, further declines in funding rates might signal a reversal. Essentially, if negative funding rates reappear on Binance, it may suggest that the market has reached a point of capitulation, often a precursor to a sustained recovery. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to face challenges in its upward momentum. Although the asset briefly rebounded to $100,000 earlier today following a mixed US jobs report, it quickly lost ground and was unable to sustain this recovery. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $98,226, reflecting a modest 1.8% gain in the past day. Interestingly, while Bitcoin’s price was higher at this time last week, today’s trading volume surpasses last week’s levels. Notably, so far, BTC’s daily trading volume climbed from $34 billion last Friday to over $55 billion today. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Taps $100,000 But Fails To Hold Amid Mixed US Jobs Report",2025-02-08 06:30:28+00:00,"The US Bureau of Labour Statistics released the January 2025 employment data earlier today, briefly pushing Bitcoin (BTC) to $100,000 before it lost all its gains and tumbled back to the $98,000 price level.  Bitcoin Rises And Falls Amid Mixed Employment Data Bitcoin spiked from approximately $97,200 to a high of $100,110 after the US reported lower-than-expected job growth for January. According to the data, the US added 143,000 jobs last month, falling short of the projected 170,000. For comparison, December 2024 saw a job increase of 256,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Hour RSI Hits Oversold Zone – Is A BTC Rebound Near? However, Bitcoin’s rally was short-lived, as it quickly erased nearly all its gains, sliding back to $97,957. The following chart illustrates the brief BTC price surge before it retraced to previous levels. In addition to the lower-than-expected job growth, the unemployment rate declined from 4.1% to 4%, highlighting the resilience of the US labor market despite elevated interest rates throughout most of 2024. Following this strong labor market data, the CME FedWatch Tool now assigns only an 8.5% probability of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting interest rates at its next meeting on March 19. Notably, this probability stood at 15% before the employment report was released. A lower likelihood of rate cuts suggests that interest rates will remain higher for longer, dampening Bitcoin bulls’ hopes for multiple reductions in 2025, that could inject fresh liquidity into the market and potentially benefit risk-on assets like BTC. It’s worth noting that from September to December 2024, the Fed slashed interest rates by a total of 100 basis points. However, given the continued strength of the labor market and low unemployment, the Fed may adopt a more cautious stance, choosing to wait for potential economic warning signs before implementing further cuts. Global capital markets commentator, The Kobeissi Letter noted that the current US unemployment rate is the lowest since May 2024. They added that the “Fed pause is here to stay.” BTC Steady Despite Macroeconomic Headwinds Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range of $92,000 to $106,000, keeping both bulls and bears uncertain about its next move. Despite this, the flagship cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience in the face of several macroeconomic challenges that, under normal circumstances, might have triggered a significant sell-off in the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ For instance, BTC remained unfazed by the stock market downturn triggered by the release of China’s AI-powered language model, DeepSeek. Similarly, the digital asset held strong despite renewed trade tensions between the US and China, following President Donald Trump’s imposition of 10% tariffs on the Asian economic powerhouse, which led to retaliatory measures. However, concerns persist regarding the recent slump in Bitcoin network activity, with some analysts questioning whether BTC is currently overvalued. At press time, BTC trades at $98,015, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from TradingView.com",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Here’s how Ethereum and other altcoins compare. Top 10 Shiba Inu Wallets Control The Majority Of Supply In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the total holdings of the ten largest whales compares for four altcoins: Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Chainlink (LINK), and Toncoin (TON). Related Reading: Bitcoin Still In Bull Market, On-Chain Indicator Confirms Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in this metric for these assets over the last few months. As displayed in the graph, Shiba Inu has the metric at the highest level right now, with around 61.3% of the memecoin’s supply in the control of the ten largest investors on the network. Ethereum follows up SHIB in second with the indicator currently sitting at 46.1%. While the top 10 whales don’t quite control the majority of the supply for ETH, they are still quite close to do so. Toncoin and Chainlink, however, have the metric at 33.1% and 32.8%, respectively, which suggests the supplies of the two are more evenly distributed throughout the network. In general, a high amount of supply centralization on a few hands isn’t constructive for any cryptocurrency. “If these wallets decide to sell, it can cause sharp price drops, creating greater risks for smaller investors,” notes Santiment. That said, the analytics firm also says: However, if these large holders keep holding or accumulating, it generally signals confidence in the project and can actually reward traders who collectively hold less power, and rely more heavily on the behavior of a few large key stakeholders. Regardless, it’s important to remember this level of concentration can make a coin more volatile, as a few players have the power to influence price movements. From the chart, it’s apparent that Shiba Inu, Ethereum, and Chainlink have all seen the indicator move sideways during the last few months, which means that their largest whales have been holding tight onto their coins. This also implies, though, that these holders haven’t been buying more, either. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Crash To $1,700 If This Support Fails, Analyst Says Toncoin stands out as the altcoin that has seen the top 10 whales increase their supply share during the period. This active accumulation can naturally be a bullish sign for the asset. Out of these cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu could be the one most likely to suffer from destabilization, as it’s only in the hands of just ten investors to make market moves that involve the majority of the supply. Toncoin and Chainlink would be the on the other end of the spectrum, with their supply distribution being more healthy. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000152, down almost 22% over the last week.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Sees Largest Exchange Withdrawals Since FTX Collapse—What’s Next?,2025-02-08 03:30:14+00:00,"Bitcoin’s price performance remains subdued, with the cryptocurrency trading above $97,000 at the time of writing—a roughly 6.5% decline over the past week. The crypto asset has yet to reclaim the $100,000 level it lost earlier this week, leaving market participants uncertain about the near-term direction. Amid this backdrop, one CryptoQuant contributor, known as caueconomy, provided an analysis of a significant development involving Bitcoin’s exchange withdrawals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still In Bull Market, On-Chain Indicator Confirms Largest Exchange Withdrawals Since FTX Collapse In a recent post, caueconomy highlighted the largest volume of exchange withdrawals since the FTX collapse. According to the data, over 47,000 BTC were removed from exchange reserves. While some of these movements may be internal, they also indicate potential accumulation by a large market player or institutional entity. This trend of Bitcoin moving off exchanges typically signals a long-term bullish perspective, as fewer coins available for trading may lead to reduced sell-side pressure over time. However, the analyst clarified that this shift does not produce an immediate supply shock capable of impacting Bitcoin’s price in the short term. Instead, it points to a gradual accumulation phase that could provide support for future price appreciation. The largest volume of exchange withdrawals since the collapse of FTX “While these withdrawals do not reflect an immediate “supply shock” to the price of bitcoin… it still reveals a trend of accumulation by large players.” – By @caueconomy Full post 👇https://t.co/ZjYBijDOZp pic.twitter.com/ZEWj95wtfD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 7, 2025 Bitcoin Breakout On The Horizon? Meanwhile, another CryptoQuant analyst, Onatt, offered insights into potential breakout scenarios for Bitcoin. Onatt pointed to the strong buying interest captured in the Coinbase Premium Index, a measure that compares Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase to other exchanges. A positive premium often reflects heightened demand from institutional investors, suggesting that the market’s upward potential is intact. Onatt also noted the crossover of key moving averages—SMA14 and SMA60—indicating a possible build-up of bullish momentum. The analyst further highlighted Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with gold and the S&P 500, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s performance may align more closely with traditional risk assets. If the broader financial markets adopt a “risk-on” sentiment, Bitcoin could see an upward trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Slumps To One-Year Low – Is BTC Overpriced? Additionally, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent comments regarding the limited impact of employment data on inflation have helped stabilize market expectations.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Dominance 2021 Vs. 2025: Why Striking Similarities May Show If An Altcoin Season Is Possible,2025-02-08 02:00:35+00:00,"As expectations of an altcoin season mount, a new technical analysis of the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) draws striking parallels between the 2021 and 2025 market cycles, aiming to determine whether altcoins are on the brink of another bull run. Historically, Bitcoin Dominance has been a key indicator in predicting the likelihood of an altcoin, as a decline in BTC.D often signals a shift in investors’ focus on alternative cryptocurrencies.  Historical Bitcoin Dominance Signal Possible Altcoin Season Crypto analyst Luca on X (formerly Twitter) is questioning whether history is repeating itself as similar past market trends emerge in this current cycle. The analyst shared two parallel charts, tracking the Bitcoin Dominance market capitalization and the start of the altcoin season.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market The chart compared the BTC.D market cap in the 2021 and 2025 cycles, revealing an eerily similar pattern that unfolded during the bull market in 2021. Back then, many investors had anticipated the start of the altcoin season immediately after BTC.D hit a high-timeframe resistance. However, to the surprise of the broader market, Bitcoin’s dominance deviated above the resistance, leading to a mass sell-off in altcoins.  Fast-forward to 2025, Luca believes this narrative is playing out again. As BTC.D dropped below the 61% resistance zone, the market hoped for a rotation into altcoins. Instead, BTC.D surged even higher, deviating again and triggering a mass capitulation of altcoins.  Luca’s Bitcoin Dominance chart shows the resistance zone where BTC.D struggled to break through in 2021 and 2025. In both cycles, BTC.D deviated from this resistance level. However, after the shift in 2021, Bitcoin dominance fell sharply to the green zone between 58% and 60%. This zone corresponded with a major rally that sparked the start of the altcoin season.  In the 2025 BTC.D chart, Luca highlighted the next green zone as around 54.56%. If historical trends repeat, BTC.D may drop to this low level and potentially trigger a similar rally to kickstart this cycle’s anticipated altcoin season.  At the moment, all eyes are on BTC.D as the market awaits its next move, which could define the fate of altcoins in this bull market. The analyst notes that the key question remains: will history repeat itself, or will the 2025 cycle run a new course?  Analyst Says 2025 Altcoin Season Is Out Of Reach In another X post, a crypto analyst, Brucer, argues that the altcoin season may not occur during this cycle. He outlines three primary reasons for his foreboding analysis, underscoring that during past cycles, the altcoin season was driven by major events like the 2017 ICO boom. However, each cycle varies in intensity and may not repeat the same conditions that led to past altcoin seasons. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Secondly, Brucer noted that altcoins are currently struggling to regain previous highs while Bitcoin’s dominance continues to rise, now sitting above a 60% market cap. Lastly, the analyst suggested that an altcoin season 2025 is unlikely unless significant macroeconomic changes occur.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is Dogecoin Massively Undervalued? Analyst Says ‘Now Is The Time’,2025-02-08 00:30:07+00:00,"A newly released video analysis by crypto commentator asif.eth (@asifeth) makes the case that Dogecoin is currently trading at what he calls a heavily undervalued level. He offered an explanation of why he believes the coin’s ongoing correction may have just concluded—a process he interpreted through an Elliott Wave lens and, more specifically, an ABC corrective pattern. Has Dogecoin Finished Its ABC Correction? In his discussion, the analyst described how Dogecoin had exhibited a pronounced rise, after which he saw “the first A correction and after that we got a B higher high, higher low… and after that we got a C type correction.” He suggested that this final “C wave” might have drawn the token back into a crucial support region, remarking that “this could be ABC and the current correction is playing out with an RSI at oversold territory,” a condition he views as a strong buy signal. Although he acknowledged the possibility of miscounting the waves, he maintained that the structure points to a broad corrective phase that could now be nearing completion. The key price region he identified spans from around $0.24 down to $0.18, an area he repeatedly called a “very, very good” place to accumulate Dogecoin. He referred to it as a “huge supply turn to huge demand zone,” noting that the token had previously flipped this same range between support and resistance several times. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crashes 40%, But This Analyst Sees A Bullish Setup While he has confidence in the bullish significance of that zone, he outlined $0.16 as a strict cutoff below which he would exit a Dogecoin position, stating, “If in any case… you break below $0.16, you have to sell that token,” because a drop beneath that level could invalidate the entire bullish setup. His point was that continuing to hold an altcoin below such a critical support might expose traders to deeper losses if negative sentiment suddenly accelerates. He also backed up his argument by pointing to the so-called Fib golden pocket, measured from what he described as Dogecoin’s last major low in August 2024 to the subsequent price high. By overlapping that Fibonacci retracement with the same $0.24–$0.18 demand region, he found consistent evidence that the market views this band as pivotal for Dogecoin’s long-term structure. He described it as “exactly aligning with our top supply zone,” explaining that confluence like this—in combination with an oversold RSI reading—boosts the likelihood of a price rebound. Related Reading: Expert Predicts Dogecoin Price Recovery: Targeting New Heights Between $1.5 And $2 Although the analyst mentioned that Dogecoin’s “hype” factor has waned, he interpreted that lack of mainstream speculation as a positive sign, claiming “no one is selling Dogecoin like hyper aggressively,” which could foster stability in the near term. The sentiment, in his view, might shift sharply once traders realize that the coin has bottomed in its ABC correction, especially if broader market conditions turn more favorable. He concluded by reiterating the importance of watching these levels closely. He sees the $0.24–$0.18 corridor as a prime accumulation zone, views $0.16 as a clear stop-loss level in case the market breaks down, and believes Dogecoin’s price action around these thresholds will confirm whether the ABC correction is truly complete. Recalling his own words, “Dogecoin is looking very, very good and very, very discounted in this whole market,” he urged potential buyers to consider the coin’s risk-to-reward ratio at a time when other traders, anticipating the end of the so-called meme coin era, appear to be overlooking it. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Mert shares his early crypto journey, from working at Coinbase to choosing Solana over Ethereum for its performance-driven approach and how Solana’s unique approach to bandwidth and latency enables it to stand apart from Ethereum’s fragmented L2 ecosystem. 

Learn how Helius is fixing Solana’s developer experience by addressing key issues like on-chain data readability, inefficient software, and high transaction costs, enabling developers to build scalable, user-friendly applications.

Whether you’re a developer, founder, or crypto enthusiast, this discussion is packed with valuable insights into Solana’s role in Web3 innovation.

Reddit,solana,Tips for anyone trying to start using telegram trading bots?,2025-02-08 00:04:07,"

I'm already a sol holder and I'm aware there are risks involved in using trading bots. I'm not investing a substantial amount of money. I just have a few spare thousand that i would want to try trading sol memecoins with, and I've been seeing alot of videos about telegram trading bots. Can people recommend me good places/communities to learn better on how to use these trading bots and some of the safest bots to use that are not going to just withdraw all my money after a while lol. Also probably where i can get info and stay updated on new tokens and in general tips to stay safe while attempting to do this.

This move earned me quite a few extra few SOL’s.

I have 2 questions for this community.

1. If I’m doing this moves on a ledger that hasn’t been associated with my social security or me at all… tax ramifications? How can they prove I did this?

2. Should I do this move again as we’re at 508 Sol’s per BTC as I type this… should I double down and do 25% of the BTC this time?

Reddit,solana,Automated memecoin trading bot,2025-02-08 01:43:32,"I need your opinions if this a feasible idea, something similar to sol sniper bot but with a higher level of customization:

\- automatically scans dexscreener for new tokens on it

\- it checks the token using the solana sniffer API to determine the potential risk level

\- if the risk level is low, it buys the token

\- after a certain % of profit it sells the token

Problems i find with this:

\- speed - i probably need to spend a 1-2k extra for this bot to be among the fast ones when purchasing coins

\- i wanted to add a part where it checks the social buzz and mentions of the token to give me an idea it if is something community backed, but the twitter API could be a problem there as i want this token check to run every minute

Reddit,solana,Best Platform To Launch On?,2025-02-08 05:37:16,"Hi All!

Currently I am seeing 3 options to launch a Solana token (outside of doing the whole kit and caboodle myself on something like createmytoken etc); and I'd love some feedback from those with exp on which platform is ""better"". \*I put better in quotes because I know none of these are perfect and launching Sol memes is pretty much a trip to vegas to play ""watch the snipers"" slots - so need for that type of commentary please lol\*

1. [Pump.Fun](http://pump.fun/) \- obviously cheap, fast, huge following, pays .5 sol ""IF"" you migrate. Main question here which I can't get a straight answer on is: do they pay the .5 sol if the ""Dev""/creator also makes an initial purchase at launch? Some say yes some say no. Biggest con imo - is its rep for being scam city (well deserved) and the likelihood that I'd get rugged by snipers off the bat lol. But - the community is huge and thats helpful for a newer token who hasnt established much of a following yet. Also, I'm just kind of leary of the lawsuits popping up.
2. Moonshot (via Dexscreener) - cheap, but does have deployment fee, comes with enhanced Dex listing ($295 savings), and if i were to select raydium - pays 2 sol ""IF"" token migrates. Question here is also the same as above; is the 2 sol paid if the creator makes the initial purchase or is it only if the creator does NOT make the initial purchase? Can't tell from the docs. Also, if the creator makes the initial purchase is this considered ""liquidity"" and locked/burned or is it treated as a normal transaction that can be traded as per usual? Obvious con; community is smaller, don't see many tokens migrating from Moonshot and I've ""heard"" most will climb to just above bonding then Dump - speculation seems to be its an inside job with Moonshot /Dex.
3. A newer one - I've found ""GoFundMemes"" - super new, Ui looks janky, but I like that you can raise as little or as much you want prior to migration. They also seem to have a version that allows you to create your own tokenomics and vesting schedules. But again it looks like it showed up like a week or so ago and I don't know anybody who has launched on it .... so there's that

Any feedback would be appreciated (given its on topic and not to tell me to not bother wasting my time launching a token on Solana lol)

Reddit,solana,"Why Liquid Staking is Better Than Staking on Centralized Exchanges (and Why You Should Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase)",2025-02-06 22:52:53,"Hey,  
I have been seeing a lot of questions about staking lately, especially around liquid staking vs. staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Binance, or Bybit. I wanted to share my thoughts on why liquid staking is the better move and why you should avoid staking SOL on Binance (bSOL), Bybit, or even Coinbase.

**1. Liquid Staking Gives You Flexibility**  
When you stake SOL through liquid staking protocols (like Marinade, Lido, The Vault or Jito), you get a liquid staked token (e.g., mSOL, stSOL, or jitoSOL, vSOL) in return. This means you can still use your staked SOL in DeFi..lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity while earning staking rewards. It’s the best of both worlds: you’re securing the network and earning yield, but you’re not locked out of using your funds.

With centralized exchanges, your SOL is locked up. You can’t do anything with it until you unstake (which can take days). That’s a huge opportunity cost, especially in a fast-moving ecosystem like Solana where DeFi opportunities are everywhere.

**2. Decentralization Matters**  
Staking on centralized exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase means they control the validators. This centralizes power and goes against the whole ethos of crypto. Solana is all about decentralization, and by staking with independent validators (or through liquid staking protocols that delegate to them), you’re helping keep the network secure and decentralized.

**3. The Vault Supports Decentralization by Delegating to Community-Driven Validators**  
One thing I love about liquid staking protocols like The Vault is that they actively support decentralization. For example, The Vault delegates to validators that are actively involved in the Solana community. These validators aren’t just big players with massive stakes, they’re smaller, community-driven operators who contribute to the ecosystem. By staking through The Vault, you’re not just earning rewards; you’re helping grow a more decentralized and resilient network.

**4. Avoid Binance bSOL, Bybit Staked SOL, and Coinbase**  
This is where it gets sketchy. Binance’s bSOL and Bybit’s staked SOL are essentially IOU tokens. You’re not actually staking on the Solana network, you’re trusting Binance or Bybit to do it for you. This adds unnecessary counterparty risk. What happens if Binance or Bybit gets hacked, goes down, or decides to freeze withdrawals? You’re stuck.

Coinbase isn’t much better. I used to stake my SOL on Coinbase because it was “easy,” but I quickly realized I was getting a lower APY compared to liquid staking or even direct staking. Plus, Coinbase takes a (35%) cut of your rewards, so you’re leaving money on the table. And just like Binance and Bybit, you’re trusting a centralized entity with your funds. If Coinbase has issues (like they did during the SEC lawsuit), your staked SOL could be at risk.

**5. Better Yields with Liquid Staking**  
Liquid staking protocols often offer competitive APYs, and you can boost your returns even further by using your liquid staked tokens in DeFi. For example, you can deposit vSOL or jitoSOL into a lending platform or LP pool and stack yields. Centralized exchanges can’t compete with that.  


I used to stake on Coinbase because it felt “safe” and familiar, but once I learned more about how staking works and the risks of centralized exchanges, I switched to liquid staking. Now I use The Vault, and it’s been a game-changer. Not only am I earning better yields, but I can also use my vSOL in DeFi to maximize my returns. Plus, knowing that my stake is supporting community-driven validators through The Vault makes me feel like I’m actually contributing to Solana’s growth. It’s a no-brainer once you understand the benefits.

What do you guys think? Anyone else make the switch from CEX staking to liquid staking? ",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

* crypto call groups - most of them are just people randomly selecting coins and promoting them, with 80% of them ending in a rugpull minutes after the call

I recently looked into the LPs on Raydium for the first time and used Metrix Finance to sim a few positions. The experience I've had before with LPs was from Pancake Swap previously.

Simming the position of SOL-RAY on Metrix shows that if you were to put down $10k based on a reasonable exposure percentage you're looking at about 100% APR give or take across 90 days. 

Is it me or do these seem to be too good to be true? You're looking at a full return within 9 months if compounding.

I've been researching recently about how much im making from trading and how much fees im paying for a possibility of running my own.

So I started a fresh wallet with 3 SOL, hoping that'll make reviewing PNLs easier. After 4 days of trading I checked GMGN and while my wallet holds 19.43(16.43 profit) sol my PNL shows I have earned 26 sol, so about 10 sol off. I assume that 10sol was due to fees.

Now I need some info incase im missing something on the costing of running my own bot.

\- VM to run code base. I assume I dont need some heavy stuff here 100$ a month budget might be too much?  
\-Node, here is where things get complicated, Ive seen nodes under 49$ that claims to have optimisation for trading, others suggest getting a dedicated node(2500$).  
\-And the thing im most concerned about is if there would still be percentage fees to execute my trades.

Best case im looking at 150 USD worst would be 2500+percentage fee, with my worst case scenario making the project moot. So info on my third point would be highly appreciated.

Reddit,solana,Been hesitant to trade on Solana.. thinking about getting in,2025-02-05 18:47:47,"I’ve really only traded on CEX, and on-chain I’ve only done SUI, because I got swept in the notion that SUI may one day become SOL. 

I feel like I’ve missed SOL meme season for the last 2 years but I think there’s still some time left.

The reason why I’m interested now is after seeing coins like TRUMP and SSE moon fast.

Is it realistic to think I can catch these coins early on dexscreener?

I’m not really looking to get into pump.fun coins as I’ve heard 99% of them are rugs, and I don’t only want to trade $30 as my buys. 

Can anyone set me straight, or just tell me to keep doing what I’m doing buying larger caps on Binance?",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,ethereum,Which web/online wallet allows you to put name labels?,2025-02-07 01:00:03,"I have a need to personalize the ethereum address (via a screenshot) to make it clear to corporate purposes and the tax authority of my country of residence for accounting purposes. This is important to reflect the essence of the operation, for example, there was a movement of an ETH between an individual and his own legal entity, but not the sale of capital. 

In other words, I want to go through some service like Myetherwallet into my wallet and put my full name next to the address, as well as with the opportunity to show in the service itself a transaction originating in the past, and regarding it, so that the screen shows that the wallet belongs to me.

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Reddit,ethereum,🚀 Major Update: Wanchain’s ETH XFlows Now Integrated with Polygon zkEVM! 🚀,2025-02-03 14:56:23,"https://preview.redd.it/mnxzuga2uxge1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=930d2fb712a78a211091fca9262c13d3acd8fdb9

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Reddit,ethereum,"EIP for PDAs, for dapps? (Programmatically derived addresses)",2025-01-29 11:53:01,"Hey everyone, I'm a dev with a long background in eth. I'm working on a new project now, and PDAs are very powerful. I'd like to include them, but ethereum has never offered anything like this.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Reddit,ethereum,New L2 Capable of supporting World's Population on Ethereum: Intmax,2025-01-27 05:46:19,"Anyone have thoughts or opinions on [Intmax](https://www.intmax.io/plasmanext)?  Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

We hope you love it and have a nice day. **�**�",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO. FYI CEO of this company is doing a fireside chat on Tuesday in case you wanna shill an $ETH MicroStrategy approach for him lol.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Earning bitcoin

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,Why capital gains tax is pure theft,2025-02-07 17:53:11,"Say you have $100,000 you want to protect from inflation. 

You buy an asset (Bitcoin, Gold, Real-estate).

In 5 years, your asset is worth $250,000.

You sell and must pay capital gains taxes on $150,000 (at 20% that would be $30,000 in tax).

But over those 5 years, the government printed 10% new money each year, which devalued your dollars by 37.9%.

That means they already taxed you on your wealth each year, so why are you also paying a ""capital gain"" on the sale?

So the calculation should be:

$250,000 - 37.9% depreciation - $100,000 initial investment

Your actual gain was only $93,150 after depreciation.

But you're being asked to pay 20% on the total $150,000 instead of on the actual inflation adjusted gains.

And even worse, the inflation numbers they publish are fake to make them seem better than reality actually is, so you can't even calculate an accurate depreciation over time (more accurate to use real estate prices to see depreciation rate).

So why the fuck do we allow them to charge us capital gains tax, when we are ALREADY TAXED EVERY YEAR by the MONEY PRINTING??

Complete bullshit.

The UK government has ordered Apple to add backdoor access to encrypted iCloud data, citing security concerns. Apple is pushing back, arguing it would compromise user privacy. Rather than complying, Apple might remove encrypted storage from the UK altogether. If they cave, it could set a precedent for other governments to demand the same.

This is yet another reminder: Never store private keys or other sensitive data online. If your Bitcoin keys are in iCloud (or any cloud), they’re not really yours.

Also, the $0.45 buys are to best capture dips, and to fill my would-be desire to overbuy BTC.

Reddit,bitcoin,"UTXO Consolidation: Benefits, Risks, and Best Practices.",2025-02-07 13:50:22,"A few days ago, Bitcoin's mempool fees were at rock bottom, with almost no transactions. This made it a perfect time to consolidate UTXOs.

However, I feel like not many people talk about the risks of consolidation, so I’ll share a couple of basic tips.

Try using coin control to carefully select which UTXOs to consolidate and which ones to keep separate. If you’ve bought BTC with KYC and BTC without KYC, consolidating them is a terrible idea since your KYC BTC will ""contaminate"" the non-KYC ones. Always keep them separate.

Keep in mind that if you use a hardware wallet, your public key (not your private key) can be exposed when you spend. These wallets typically generate different public addresses to receive Bitcoin, but once you consolidate and spend, blockchain analysts can link all those addresses together and associate them with you.

Whenever possible, use CoinJoin to mix your UTXOs and make tracking more difficult. Avoid withdrawing all your BTC at once— instead, make multiple withdrawals of varying amounts.

Stay SAFU!

Reddit,bitcoin,The Power of Scale and Niches,2025-02-07 19:11:39,"2000 years ago, you wore many hats and did many things.  Now you can get paid money just by doing one niched job every day - such as driving a garbage truck around the city and emptying peoples trash cans.  You can get even more niche than that too once economies grow.  The more niched, the more skill one needs to possess to do one tiny aspect of a job.

This is the same thing for money.  I used to like gold and silver, but niched money is superior.  Money that is invaluable to multiple trillion dollar industries like medicine, electronics, defense, and even jewelry does not make for efficient money.  I believe gold and silver won't be used as money in the future but fall back to their industrial use cases.

Bitcoin is min maxed money.  No other ulterior use cases so it can focus on being really great money.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779
Reddit,bitcoin,I am terrified to move my BTC,2025-02-06 14:53:23,"Hello fellow BTC pro’s

I want to start out by saying I am sorry for this post. I have somewhere between .5-1 BTC sitting on an exchange. I’ve been DCA’ing for several years now. And I am absolutely *terrified* to move it off the exchange. 

I know I need to do it. I see the constant comments about supply shock and the rapid removal from BTC from exchanges. I know mine isn’t safe where it is. 

The problem is, I’m so scared to move it. I work in tech, and I’m still not comfortable moving it. Then to top it all off, I have the memory of a fish. I’m scared I’ll lose my keys.. even though I do have several backup plans for those. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get over this initial fear? I just can’t be the only one who feels this way… 

Anyone who also faced this same issue want to share what worked to make you comfortable doing this? 

Anyone who DM’s me is going to get blocked. I read this sub like the morning paper and I’m overly cautious of being scammed (outside of my BTC staying on the exchange)🤡",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Has anyone got some review about KuCoin? Im in EU but just recently heard about this, is it KYC exchange or not, will the government be able to track and see my purchase history?  Since so many CEX have regulations to follow from Europe, is it safe to use it to substitute Kraken Pro? Their fee is 0.1% on purchase, and from their site it seems pretty decent. 

Since iny country I have the obligation to declare any crypto possession every year, with a 0.2% tax (thanks a lot..) on just mere possession, should I opt instead for an ETC/ETN on BTC? I dont have many options here, either pay that tiny 0.2% yearly on my crypto + another 0.2% on the amount of money on the exchange, or find other ways to buy BTC without tracks?",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,bitcoin,Help me make smart choices (why I shouldn’t day trade).,2025-02-07 19:52:44,"Okay, let me start by saying that I keep reading everywhere that it's not smart to day trade Bitcoin, and that's why I’m not going to do it. Everywhere, people say that you'll blow up your account that way, and I believe you. So, I’m not going to do it.

But my brain just can't grasp why it's unwise. Can you explain it to me? That way, I won’t keep doubting myself, only to have to sternly remind myself again that I **Should Not Do It**.

My mind says:

* Bitcoin has its ups and downs every day. If you look at the past few weeks, you see a low point and a high point daily.
* You can set a limit sell at a price that was reached multiple times yesterday during a peak. The chance that this price will be hit again today is quite high (and if not, you still own the Bitcoin). Assuming the price is reached, you sell your Bitcoin.
* With the money you’ve now received, you can buy new Bitcoin again. Using a limit buy, you choose a price lower than the peak at which you sold. This way, you can buy **more** Bitcoin than you originally had, increasing your portfolio. The amounts are small, but if you do this daily, you’ll gradually build up nicely. (If the lower price isn't reached right away: you haven’t lost your money—you already cashed in.)
* I take into account that there’s a small fee for buying and selling, but the profit is larger than the fee.

Where’s the catch? Is it that you don’t know when a peak will come and that there’s a chance you won’t be able to buy back cheaply?  
What else am I overlooking?

We are using Snapshot for voting directly with the Moon balance in your wallet, in a transparent and open manner. For now all Moons held in self-hosted wallets at the time of poll creation will be eligible to vote, so if you are holding Moons on an exchange, the telegram TipBot or in a wallet that you are not comfortable connecting to snapshot then please be sure to transfer your Moons to a self-hosted wallet that you are comfortable connecting to snapshot before each Moon Week. 

To give exposure to our governance polls for the month, this Moon Week post will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until next Monday.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,This space is full of absolute fucking losers,2025-02-07 23:17:28,"Sorry all - but this isn't the crypto community I remember from the last cycle.

Unfortunately, I have to go to x/twitter to get the latest dialogue for what is happening in blockchain.  This sector is infested with people (mostly men) who are some of the biggest fucking losers I have ever seen.

And yeah, I get it man, you got 7 figures in your phantom wallet.  You got a nice house, you got a big dick, you fuck beautiful women.  I get it guys, ""YOU WON"".  But you know what else?  You are the biggest losers I have ever seen.

These guys can't stop talking about sucking trumps dick, fondling elons balls.  Man - what in the fuck happened to this space?  This isn't what we were looking forward to the last cycle.  Whatever *this is* is some sick, twisted nightmare of what we all thought decentralization could be.  This isn't what I signed up for and I am definitely not down for this sick, twisted, fascist shit.

I hate what has happened to this space and I hate the type of people it attracts.  It was always there, but now it is entirely too emboldened.  It's too bad there is a silver lining of something good somewhere wayyyyyyy underneath.  I honestly hope Satoshi is still alive, and when the US government makes the biggest gamble in history on BTC, I hope he rugs the entire thing and sends that disaster leadership to the end of a terrible regime.

Sorry guys for the vent, but this space is full of toxic, loser, parasites and it only seems like it will get worse.

EDIT:  Just wanted to clarify, I was NOT targeting this sub, I am talking about X/Twitter.  However, I will say that the types of people this cycle is bringing in is definitely not exclusive to X/Twitter, it is happening anywhere and everywhere in this industry.  It just so happens that X/Twitter is the place their rhetoric is most emboldened and made into dogma.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

One website to do that is a community project: [https://hypurrscan.io/](https://hypurrscan.io/)

I was watching the page, and saw a massive Sell TWAP come in (and then shorted myself..)

Looking at the address, though, I found something pretty interesting, they have 6 million hype.

https://preview.redd.it/7ogg4tgzgshe1.png?width=1810&format=png&auto=webp&s=37076ee3f2c465d02cb5ca4e9a3cd3589c09f579

Do they just sell? Nope.

First, they open a 50k short at 24.8:

https://preview.redd.it/mufptg2vgshe1.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=78d8283edfbd47c73ed2acf47606595df51b46a7

Then they execute a 20k 20 minute sell TWAP:

https://preview.redd.it/gszmr3v3hshe1.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=c480f8827b558b2112eb55e4f43a7779d1198d09

Edit: 

They added a second 60k 30 minute sell TWAP:

Covering their ETH losses I presume.. 

What does the price do?

Notice where it bottoms out. Right around their original buy price; 22.368$.

This is just one of their sub-accounts. It \*only\* holds6 MM of Hype. God knows what their other addresses hold.

Edit 2:

Hahahah, guess when they cancelled their TWAP:

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Cryptocurrency is not worth trying to make short-term gains, and if you’re financially struggling it’s not the best idea to invest for longterm either.",2025-02-08 06:46:08,"I could literally put $100 into Bitcoin at $95,000, and a few days later it could go to $105,000 (which is actually pretty likely) and barely make $10, and there’s still FEES. I could put $1,000 in and barely make anything.

I could go for the much cheaper “altcoins”, like PEPE, but that’s more volatile and risky, and $100 still won’t make me that much of it it goes from $0.000010 to $0.000020.

If you don’t have a degree, or a driver’s license, it’s even harder to get a better job in the immediate term, especially if it’s remote.

I’m not even asking for get rich quick methods (but wouldn’t hesitate if it was likely, I’m getting more desperate).

You simply have to keep enduring suffering, whether that be in an abusive household, or homeless. There’s no quick way out, and in bad living circumstances it’s harder to build to anything longterm either.

The cost of living is WAAAAY to high compared to the federal minimum wage, and even most “entry level” jobs.

Sometimes you’re just stuck in life, and it really doesn’t seem like the struggle is worth going through anymore.

I don’t want to endure hardship anymore, there will always be someone else “who went through worse”.

Every time I try to do something it’s like the universe tries to stop me. I am running out of time too, I missed the entire first decade of real adult life.

I don’t want to go through this anymore, nothing ever pays off or leads to anything better.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Ethereum (ETH) Gas Fees Drop Below 1 Gwei ($0.06): Low Fees, High Usage, Great Success",2025-02-07 18:21:24,"I have just crossed with the following [Tweet](https://x.com/DegenerateNews/status/1887644418947027287) that made me realize how Ethereum upgrades are really proving that they are a big success.

[Ethereum Gwei](https://preview.redd.it/bcpwxibntnhe1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d50dc776860b7d41df01eb0d114209a2c8ae94)

As you can see in the image above Gwei is currently at 0.986 ($0.06) at High priority which is really cheap comparing with what we have seen in the past before. If you have been here for a long time you will understand, I suggest you to search your wallet address on Etherscan, click on Analytics tab and then on TxnFees tab to enjoy watching how much you paid on ETH gas fees in the past xD

This low fees made me think that Ethereum transactions have decreased and are low right now so I decided to check it but I am quite surprised.

[Ethereum Daily Transactions Chart](https://preview.redd.it/30fsohvvunhe1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=402d75dcea5443010e57c6313ed2eaaec6cb2a47)

As you can see in the chart above Ethereum daily transactions are 2021 levels with 1,333,804 transactions yesterday. This confirms us that people are still using Ethereum actively even if the price is not in a great place. It also confirms us that all the upgrades released during this last years are working like a charm even if the inflation has raised a bit but I think that ""problem"" will be solved soon with some changes that are coming. Its also great to see how L2s are also working as expected in the whole Ethereum scalability roadmap absorbing traffic and reducing congestion on L1.

This is bullish because it makes Ethereum competitive with other alternative chains, it is not suffering from low demand and keeps evolving.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Finding Out About Crypto Ruined My Life,2025-02-06 23:33:56,"Let me preface this by saying that as someone with an engineering degree I’m a complete idiot. 

I learned about crypto while I was in college in 2017. Funny enough my classmate told me about bitcoin in 2015 when it was $400 and I laughed it off as broke college kid. Anyway, 2017, I became obsessed and I had my phase of telling everyone I knew about crypto and that they should buy.

I managed to turn a few hundred bucks into 10 grand. As someone who’s been a lazy procrastinator my whole life this new thing was my golden ticket out of needing to work ever again. Of course I didn’t sell anything before it disappeared.

By 2020 I had almost forgot about my bag. By 2021 I felt like a genius again and “knew” I was right. I still never pulled out cash, if I sold, it was to buy other coins and you know how that went. It’s 2025 now and I’m tired. I’m tired of what crypto has done to my mental health. 

These crazy crypto swings have made it so I’m entirely not grounded with money. What’s $500 when we’re seeing $5k swings (and never selling, just eating poopoo). 

That’s not even the best part, because don’t forget as lazy person the idea of one day becoming a crypto millionaire (so hopeful) is a great way to kill your career ambitions. Now here we are, crypto is finally gaining some traction in the real world and I’m not a millionaire no where close, my job is shit, and I got a ton of debt. 

Don’t be like me. Don’t romanticize your gains. Work hard in your life as if crypto is going to zero. I’m sure many of you will think this nonsense doesn’t apply to you. It does. Anyway I welcome the chat to shit on my and/or make me feel better. Thanks. 


Edit: Bear with me I said I studied maths, I’m not a writer. I’m still in profit. I have a mains bag and a memes bag. I don’t blame crypto. I am blaming myself, my point was with my personality finding something like this was a bad bad thing for me. 

I didn’t even consider the market being a little down right now writing this post. It was more so the stress of things outside crypto and dwelling on how I got here that made me write this now. Those choices made it so my unrealized gains aren’t as life changing. Hopefully this helps some people from making the same wrong choices.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,It’s genuinely disappointing how few people care about the actual technology anymore,2025-02-07 03:39:33,"Been here since 2016 and everyone used to follow the technology, and you could have great conversations about what technology is the best. Regardless of what subreddit you posted in. People were interested in discussing a chains current upgrades, or open to discussion on what they could work on, and what other chains were leading the way.

Now unfortunately you make any post remotely trying to discuss issues with a chain’s technology, or compare one chain’s technology to another, and that post is going to be obliterated. 

Personally as a software engineer I think Polakdots JAM upgrade is really important for the industry. And I frequently try to get insight into why other people think their chain of choice will have the best technology. 

But literally all you see now is “dead chain”, “look at price”, “look at how fast our transaction are”… like totally fine I get it most people are here for the gains now. But all the subreddits are essentially run by them now, and its impossible to have a solid discussion about the state of the technology

The more valuable it becomes, the more incentive there is to do good. In times of national or international strife, the value would supposedly rise, to encourage more positive actions. 

At some point it might even be useful to consider making this the basis store of value, since ""scarcity"" like gold is kinda silly, and ""arbitrary"" value like btc that is able to be manipulated by financial interest alone means that the rich continue to benefit more significantly than ""normal"" people. 

It would have to be one-directional tradable though, or something. Or only able to be purchased (or burned) by institutions delivering programs. 

Or awarded by consensus of others, with the scarcity of your awarding determining the strength of your vote to award. (To prevent people forming a group and just awarding each other back and forth). 

And penalties could be leveraged against institutions or govts that commit bad actions, like polluting a river, tearing down a forest, or, say, displacing an entire population from their residences. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

In fact the system could be entirely sentimental, where people contribute and vote for activities they see as good or bad. 

This is just brainstorm, no idea how any of it would work obviously. The idea though fundamentally would be to provide a counter to raw profiteering - some kind of social accountability for both good and bad. 

And now I realise this sounds exactly like ""social credit"" so obviously it would have to be designed to address the flaws in those systems heh.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

This lack of openness has long plagued philanthropy, preventing generosity and engendering suspicion. 

  
Now, blockchain technology is taking over to alter that. Blockchain ensures giving to charities is fully transparent with its **unhackable, decentralized ledger**. 



Because each donation is tracked and logged, contributors may confirm the use of their funds. By cutting out the middlemen, this **cuts out fraud**, ensures that money actually reaches the intended recipients, and reduces administrative costs. 



More of the money goes directly to the cause in question. Companies like the World Food Programme (WFP) have already been using Blockchain to distribute aid, allowing the tracking of resources in real time. Platforms such as Giveth and Alice are making trust even stronger by showing donors the instant impact of their donation. 



The potential is huge: if trust rises, blockchain use in charity can improve worldwide donations by **30%.** Yet, there are still issues to be resolved, such as **technical adoption and regulatory barriers**. 



But one thing is for sure: blockchain can revolutionize philanthropy. Is this how charity giving will develop in the future? If you could see your impact in real time, would you be more likely to donate? ",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Does anyone in this sub remember ERG and the hype around it? Need a reality check,2025-02-08 00:01:01,"When I first got into Crypto properly, it was ADA @ around $0.12. kept it up all last cycle and sold near the top, after degenerate margin trades to lose a big chunk too. 

Many vets from last cycle and the cycle before may remember how ADA was laughed at in this sub. Sure, Cardano Apes didn't give us a good name by screaming ""ETH killer"" everywhere, but eventually, this sub started to accept ADA's value and it became less of a joke. 

That's when I first heard about ERG, and there was a small swarm around it at that time. Created by the co-founder of LINK, PoW, profitable to mine and ASIC resistant. Smart contracts, all that sexy talk. 

But... It fell off the map. They seem to have been developing a lot during the bear, and have some crazy ideas like their cross-chain bridge etc. But it makes me wonder, it really was the sweet child of this sub at one point. 

Could it pull another ADA, and defy all odds to rise up amongst the decentralised crypto bros? I feel like I need someone to talk me out of going all in here. 

Is it worth a punt? What do people think here? It's giving me early ADA vibes, and my gut feeling was right with that one. It's things like their bridge that gives people the ability to become a 'watcher' of transactions. Earning a pretty solid ROI for doing so per transaction. Things like a stable coin on the chain, Palmyra, ADA collabs etc. 

I need objective views here. Hoping some boys in here can have an honest investors conversation about ERG or any similar projects with high potential. ",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Crypto Beginner advice,2025-02-07 22:56:36,"Good afternoon, my last post was removed for not having enough characters. So I’m going to try this again.

I am a beginner in crypto, I’ve got Coinbase and phantom wallet and Robinhood and have small positions in a few of the big coins: Solana ethereum and a very little bitcoin.

I’m curious about any good YouTube videos or classes I can take that I can build my knowledge on things like the blockchain, Bullx, and how to watch Dexscreener, candles, spot trends and everything.

Thus far I’ve just been following advice from friends and jumping on bandwagon meme coins and mostly getting cracked. Did make a bit of a windfall with the Trump coin (got in at 3 and out at 40) and I’m trying to replicate even half of that return on a semi regular basis.

Any advice on how to get started and what videos to watch would be great. I know there are tons out there so just trying to narrow down who to watch, what to read, who to follow.

Thanks so much! Hopefully this is enough characters not to be removed by a bot. ",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Best Crypto Based on Priority,2025-02-07 05:48:10,"The “best” cryptocurrency depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown based on different priorities:

1. Best for Stability & Store of Value:

Bitcoin (BTC) – As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is widely regarded as “digital gold.” It has the highest market capitalization, institutional adoption, and a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it a solid long-term store of value.

2. Best for Fast & Cheap Transactions:

XRP (Ripple) – Known for its speed and low transaction fees, XRP is designed for cross-border payments and bank partnerships. If regulation clears up in its favor, it could see significant institutional adoption.

3. Best for Smart Contracts & Decentralized Finance (DeFi):

Ethereum (ETH) – The leading blockchain for DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. While gas fees can be high, Ethereum 2.0 upgrades aim to improve scalability and reduce costs.

4. Best for Privacy:

Monero (XMR) – If privacy is a priority, Monero is the best option, as it offers untraceable transactions. However, regulatory concerns around privacy coins could pose challenges.

5. Best for Low Fees & High Scalability:

Solana (SOL) – A fast and scalable blockchain with low fees, often considered an “Ethereum killer.” However, it has experienced network outages.

6. Best for Institutional Adoption & Regulations:

Ripple (XRP) & Ethereum (ETH) – With banks and governments exploring blockchain technology, these two are often considered the most likely to gain regulatory approval and institutional backing.

7. Best for Passive Income (Staking & Yield Farming):
	•	Cardano (ADA) – Uses proof-of-stake for secure and energy-efficient staking.
	•	Ethereum (ETH) – After its transition to proof-of-stake, you can stake ETH for rewards.
	•	Cosmos (ATOM) – Offers staking with decent yields and interoperability with other blockchains.

8. Best for Emerging Growth & AI Integration:
	•	Fetch.ai (FET) – A leader in AI-integrated blockchain solutions.
	•	Internet Computer (ICP) – Aims to decentralize cloud computing and web services.

Final Thoughts:
	•	For long-term holding (store of value): Bitcoin (BTC)
	•	For smart contracts & DeFi: Ethereum (ETH)
	•	For fast & cheap transactions: XRP or Solana (SOL)
	•	For privacy: Monero (XMR)
	•	For staking/yield farming: Cardano (ADA) & Cosmos (ATOM)

It’s always wise to diversify your portfolio and do your own research before investing! What are your thoughts on this?",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,This space is full of absolute fucking winners,2025-02-08 00:59:55,"Sorry all - I have been thinking a lot lately about where the crypto space is, and it's been quite a rollercoaster, to say the least. While I've seen some stuff that's given me pause, I still genuinely believe in the potential of blockchain and our community. We are all here because we see something special in this technology, and that shared vision-that belief in something bigger-makes us all winners in a way. It's like we're all on the same team, even if we sometimes disagree on the plays.

It's easy to get caught up in the noise, considering how much chatter occurs in pockets of the internet. Yeah, I too feel the subject has shifted too, and we aren't as focused on some of those core principles that bound us together. Yet, in saying that, it's real important to keep in mind just why we were into this stuff to begin with. We are winners because we joined something new, something that would change the status quo for real.

Most of us got pulled into crypto for the promise of decentralization, financial empowerment, and fairer grounds. We felt that the blockchain might be one to really stir things up and create an awful lot of good. While the road has not been perfectly smooth, with lots of bumps along the way, that is still very much a vision. We're all winners, because we strive for that better future.

I get it, I really do. It's frustrating when you see negativity and toxicity creeping in on this space. It's a disappointment when the conversation gets hijacked by other agendas. But, in my honest view, we have the power to shape where this goes next. We are all winners in that we have a voice, we have ideas, and we can contribute toward making things better.

Let's create an atmosphere of inclusion and friendliness towards all people. Let's discuss real topics, respectfully debate ideas, and bridge gaps, rather than create divisions. Let's celebrate the folks and projects actually pushing the boundaries of blockchain toward its full potential. Every little bit helps, and each contribution makes us all winners.

Still optimistic. I believe we can recapture that spirit of innovation and collaboration that defined the early days of crypto. Let's remember why we got into this in the first place, let's support each other, and let's work together to build a future where blockchain actually empowers people and makes the world a better place. I believe in this community, and I believe in the power of crypto. We're all in this together as winners! Let's make it happen!",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"If alternative cryptocurrency coins and tokens fail to make it past their all-time highs by the end of 2025, the 4 year super cycle will officially be broken.",2025-02-06 12:09:55,"Every four years or 12 to 18 months post Bitcoin's most recent Halvening we have entered into a cryptocurrency super cycle. 2025 marks the 4-year range after the last super cycle in 2021, and so far, the old alternative cryptocurrency coin and token darlings have failed to break past their all-time highs.

From 2013 to 2017 Bitcoin increased by 17,492%, from 2017 to 2021 Bitcoin increased by 252%, and so far, Bitcoin has increased by just 62% from 2021 to 2025, so this alone proves that the chances of you getting rich off of a Bitcoin investment without access to millions of dollars to invest is not happening.

With that being said, we plebes look to Bitcoin's cheaper alternatives to achieve wealth beyond our wildest dreams, but will they actually increase enough in 2025 to get us there is the ultimate question?

One of the issues we currently face nowadays that has been keeping me up at night is all the big players now taking money out of the pot. Heck, we even have the President of the United States himself throwing his coin in the ring, along with his old lady’s meme coin to boot!

The issue here is that all the dumb money is now so overly saturated, so that useless and worthless coin you and I decided to invest in months or even years ago may never suck in enough of that dumb money to pump it to the Moon and beyond.

We need these dummies. They serve as exit liquidity to inevitably enrich ourselves, because let's be real here, this is the only reason why any of us buy meme coins to begin with am I right?

Fast forward to today though, and we have players like Solana, which grants the ability for any thot and their pimp such as the Hawk Tuah Girl to create a coin, have some shady somewhat smart people market it, and then rug all the dummies who thought they would get rich off it, then rinse and repeat.

This is a problem see, because all of that dumb money is drying up, plus if you could believe it, some of these dummies actually learn their lesson and actually stop investing in dumb projects... which becomes our problem in the end.

I'll leave you all with a question: Will 2025 be another cryptocurrency super cycle year, or is the real money made these days strictly by creating, promoting, and rugging the mentally challenged?",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,X Payments.. just ask Grok,2025-02-07 20:13:50,"""Which cryptocurrency would be best suited to be utalised by x payments based on technical requirements?""


To determine which cryptocurrency would be best suited for X Payments based on technical requirements, let's examine several key aspects:

Speed and Scalability
XRP (Ripple) and XLM (Stellar):
Both are specifically designed for fast, low-cost international transfers. 
XRP can handle thousands of transactions per second with very low fees, making it suitable for high-volume, real-time payments.
XLM similarly offers fast transaction times and scalability, with a focus on financial inclusion and cross-border transfers.

Transaction Costs
Stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC):
They typically have lower transaction fees, especially on networks designed for efficiency like Tron for USDT or Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions for USDC.
Stablecoins provide an advantage in terms of transaction cost predictability, which is crucial for payment systems.

Volatility
Stablecoins:
Being pegged to fiat currencies like the USD, they offer stability which is vital for a payment system aiming to avoid the price swings common in crypto markets.

Integration and Ecosystem
Ethereum (ETH):
With its smart contract capabilities, Ethereum could enable more complex payment systems or additional features like loyalty programs or automated refunds. However, its high gas fees and slower transaction times compared to others might be a drawback unless using Layer 2 solutions.
Bitcoin (BTC):
While Bitcoin has significant brand recognition and is widely accepted, its transaction speed and fees are less optimal for everyday payments without the use of the Lightning Network, which adds another layer of complexity.

Decentralization vs. Control
Dogecoin (DOGE):
Although Dogecoin has the backing of Elon Musk, technically, it's based on Litecoin's codebase, offering faster block times than Bitcoin but with higher volatility than stablecoins. Its community support and lower fees could make it appealing, but its technical setup isn't necessarily superior for payment systems.

Conclusion Based on Technical Requirements:
Based purely on technical merits for payment processing:
XLM (Stellar) stands out for its balance of speed, low cost, and scalability. It's designed for use in payment systems, particularly for cross-border transfers, which could be a key feature for X Payments aiming for global reach.
XRP (Ripple) is another strong contender due to similar attributes, though its regulatory situation might be a concern.
Stablecoins like USDC or USDT would provide stability and low transaction costs, making them excellent for everyday transactions.

Recommendation: 
Stellar (XLM) might be the most technically suited for immediate integration into X Payments due to its focus on fast, low-cost transactions, scalability, and existing partnerships in finance. However, integrating a stablecoin for its stability could complement this, offering users both options for different use cases.

This assessment focuses on technical suitability and does not account for market sentiment, regulatory issues, or Musk's personal endorsements which could also sway the decision towards Dogecoin or Bitcoin.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

But I've tried a number of different AI bots available in my exchange and all of them do nothing except lose money.

Imagine a setup where staking your tokens could be as straightforward as setting up a direct deposit for your paycheck but with the potential for much more significant returns. There's this new approach where instead of juggling multiple platforms, everything's streamlined into one spot, making the whole process less of a brain teaser.

And these reward systems? They're getting creative, offering boosts in ways that were less common before. It's like the DeFi scene is quietly shifting towards making things more user-friendly, where you don't need to be a crypto wizard to get the most out of your investments.

Dedicate time to knowledge, commit 100 hours to fully understanding the space. Read white papers, blue papers, and yellow papers. Explore the products, dive into the code if possible, and spend time engaging with communities. Learn the history and technical aspects of projects so you can evaluate them for what they truly are, not what the marketing tells you they are.

Breadcrumb your way back in. For every hour you spend enriching your understanding, allow yourself to reinvest just 1% of your stack. This gradual approach gives you time to think critically and make informed decisions about how to allocate your net worth across multiple projects.

Slowly reinvesting also allows you to observe how your values align with your investments. For example, are you prioritizing decentralization? Utility? Innovation? Use your values as your compass, not market hype.

Own your decisions. As you rebuild your portfolio, make choices based on your own criteria. Don't trust anyone's advice blindly, not even mine. Trust in the knowledge you've gained and the research you've done. If you don't think for yourself, the market will think for you, and you'll always be at its mercy.

This approach isn't about abandoning crypto, it's about taking back control. By stepping out, educating yourself, and gradually reinvesting, you give yourself the freedom to think clearly, align your portfolio with your goals, and make informed decisions that truly represent your values.

So, Redditors, how would you allocate those 100 hours? 50 hours reading on the top 5 biggest and 50 hours on the other remaining 95? what would your spread look like?

There's only so many coins one can actually *read* about, how to know which ones to investigate deeper vs where to simply fall in line with current social/market consensus?",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-08 12:16:41.686779

Reddit,crypto,A mnemonic system to (almost) effortlessly memorize 128-bit of entropy,2024-12-28 12:47:51,"Hi,

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

Reddit,crypto,Storing libsodium private keys on disk,2024-12-27 19:31:38,"Hi everyone,

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.
