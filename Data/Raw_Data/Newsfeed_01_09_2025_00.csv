According to the analyst, a successful breakout of this bullish flag could result in a massive 50% price gain for XRP, bringing the cryptocurrency closer to its previous all-time high of $3.84, recorded during the 2021 bull run.    XRP Price Targets $3.6 After Bullish Flag Breakout Over the past few weeks, the XRP price has formed a bullish flag pattern, indicating a potential for continued upward movement. According to crypto analyst Captain Faibik’s shared chart on X (formerly Twitter), XRP is preparing to break out of this bullish flag on the daily time frame chart.  Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Supply Shock As ETF Issues Buy More BTC Than Was Produced In December A bullish flag is widely recognized as a continuation pattern. It forms when a cryptocurrency’s price is trading sideways or undergoing a correction and indicates the potential for a strong upward movement.  On the analyst’s chart, XRP is testing the upper boundary of the bullish flag pattern, aiming to break above it and trigger its next price rally. Captain Faibik has predicted that if XRP successfully breaks out of this bullish flag and maintains a price above it, it could spark an impressive 50.22% rally.  Currently trading at $2.2, If XRP can rally as much as 50% following its bullish flag breakout, its market price could jump significantly to $3.3. This projected target is just 16.36% away from breaching XRP’s $3.84 ATH, achieved during the previous bull run in 2021.  Further solidifying his confidence in XRP’s future price trajectory, Captain Faibik’s recent prediction doubles down on former projections in earlier X posts, where the analyst forecasts a massive price increase to $3.66 for XRP.  Elliott Waves To Push XRP Above $20 In another X post, a prominent crypto analyst identified as the “CryptoBull” predicted that the XRP price could soar above $20 later in this bull cycle. However, the analyst also projects that the cryptocurrency could reach a short-term target of $13 within the next few weeks.   Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market CryptoBull has based his optimistic XRP price projections on Elliott impulse waves, highlighting their impact on the cryptocurrency’s historical price movements. The analyst disclosed that Elliott impulse waves typically begin after a cryptocurrency experiences a significant price breakout.  He further explained that in 2017, the five waves of the Elliott impulse wave cycle had triggered a price surge from $0.002 to $3.84, representing a staggering 70,000% increase. Based on this historical trend, CryptoBull projects that XRP could witness a similar bull rally. He forecasts that the five Elliott impulse waves could spark a 6,000% increase in the XRP price during this bull cycle, pushing it to new ATHs of $26.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin To Blast Off? Trump’s Fury Over Interest Rates Signals Big Move,2025-01-08 22:30:43+00:00,"Bitcoin experts are buzzing as President-elect Donald Trump lashed out against current Federal Reserve policy, calling interest rates “far too high” despite persistent inflationary pressures. “We are inheriting a difficult situation from the outgoing administration,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago club, adding that officials seem to be “trying everything they can to make it more difficult” for his incoming team. The blunt remarks, coming fewer than two weeks before Trump’s inauguration, have stoked anticipation of a possible shift in US monetary policy—and raised speculation about a boost for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the new year. The 2017 Trump Playbook: Dollar “Too Strong”, Bitcoin Up? Although the economic and geopolitical landscape has changed since Trump’s first term, some market watchers see parallels to his 2017 rhetoric. Back then, he lambasted a US dollar that he deemed “too strong,” a stance that preceded a notable decline in the currency. The US Dollar Index (DXY) peaked near 104 in early January 2017 but began a downward trend that extended into early 2018, bottoming out around 98. Related Reading: Anticipating A ‘2025 Super Cycle’: Bitcoin Rallies With Trump’s Regulatory Reforms On The Horizon This sharp move in the dollar coincided with a broader risk-on environment, fueling rallies in equities as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), drew a direct comparison on X. “The last time Trump said something was ‘too high,’ it was the dollar – back in January 2017, just days before his inauguration,” Bittel stated and recounted: “Here’s what he said: ‘Our companies can’t compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it’s killing us.” Notably, last year, Trump also called recent strength a “tremendous burden on US businesses.” Bittel further argued: “Trump understands the impact of a strong dollar – and the same logic applies to high interest rates. They suppress exports, hurt corporate earnings, and slow economic growth.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Took Price From $69,000 To $108,000 Appears Again Speaking on the impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, Bittel concluded: “What happened next? Well, the dollar began a significant decline, setting the stage for one of the most pivotal macro moves we’ve seen in years – triggering a melt-up in risk assets. Déjà vu? I think so. Let’s see how it plays out.” Bittel is not the only expert speculating that the DXY may already have peaked, mirroring its 2017 topping pattern. Steve Donzé, Deputy CIO for Multi Asset at Pictet Asset Management Japan, shared a widely discussed chart on X, remarking “On time. Ready for pushback,” while overlaying recent DXY movements with the currency’s trajectory in early 2017. The chart suggests a similar pattern that could foreshadow renewed dollar weakness in the coming weeks. In a separate post, financial analyst Silver Surfer (@SilverSurfer_23) pointed to an uncanny timing overlap: “DXY topped on January 3rd, 2017—18 days before Trump’s Inauguration. DXY looks to have topped on January 2nd, 2025—19 days before Trump’s Inauguration.” He characterized the parallel as “crazy history repeating,” explaining that he sees a correlation between the path of the DXY before both inaugurations. Such analogies are fueling speculation that a repeat dollar slump could usher in an environment favoring risk assets. Should the dollar indeed enter a new downtrend—much like in 2017–2018—Bitcoin could ride a wave of renewed liquidity and speculative appetite. At press time, BTC traded at $94,950.

This enormous deposit, involving over 70 million DOGE tokens, was moved by an anonymous whale to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. Moreover, the lofty Dogecoin transaction comes on the heels of a recent10% price crash in the meme coin.  Whales Move Over 70 Million Dogecoin To Binance The recent Dogecoin price crash may have triggered fear among investors, as DOGE whales are suddenly selling off their holdings. With analysts and traders expressing hopes of an imminent Dogecoin price breakout, many are voicing frustration and concern over the ongoing DOGE sell-offs, fearing further delays in the market’s momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Faces ‘Moment Of Truth’ As It Battles The Macro 0.5 Fib Extension Notably, Whale Alert spotted a substantial Dogecoin transfer on January 7. The cryptocurrency tracker reported that approximately 70,081,124 DOGE tokens were moved by an anonymous whale to Binance. This massive deposit, worth over $27.6 million, has caught the attention of the crypto market, as most large-scale whale transactions often do.  Typically, when an asset is transferred from a wallet to a crypto exchange, it indicates the potential for a sell-off. This is because investors often move their holdings to crypto platforms like Binance when they plan to liquidate their positions.  The recent 70 million DOGE transfer is a large-scale market movement that could lead to increased volatility, potentially triggering more downturn for Dogecoin. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Dogecoin price has declined by more than 11.2% in the past 24 hours. Considering the meme coin’s susceptibility to slight changes in market trends, additional sell-offs could exacerbate fears of further declines, potentially placing even more downward pressure on Dogecoin.  Notably, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reported on X (formerly Twitter) that Dogecoin’s TD sequential is presenting a sell signal on its daily chart. Given this development, Martinez states that a Dogecoin price correction should be expected, as widespread liquidations often lead to a downtrend.   Analyst Cautions Against Selling DOGE After breaking out of this Ascending Triangle, Dogecoin appears to have returned to the apex, testing it as a new support zone and aiming to bounce off this level to continue its upward trend. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade shared a chart on X, highlighting that the apex of the Ascending Triangle could serve as a launchpad for a Dogecoin price rally, with the potential to reach a new ATH of $0.95. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk Of Supply Shock As ETF Issues Buy More BTC Than Was Produced In December   Consequently, Dogecoin investors are being urged to stay on course as the meme coin undergoes this critical phase in its price action. Trader Tardigrade has emphasized that now is not the time to sell off prematurely or short DOGE, as doing so could result in missing the projected price surge to a new ATH.

Bearish Momentum Drives Price Toward $0.00001731,2025-01-08 19:30:14+00:00,"PEPE is under pressure as its price approaches the critical $0.00001731 level, a support zone that has repeatedly tested bulls’ resilience. The renewed bearish momentum highlights growing concerns about the token’s ability to maintain stability in the face of intensified selling activity. Recent attempts to spark a recovery have been met with resistance, leaving PEPE vulnerable to further declines if the current trajectory persists. The $0.00001731 level has emerged as a key battleground, with its ability to hold determining whether PEPE can stage a comeback or succumb to deeper corrections. A breakdown below this support could amplify negative sentiment, opening the door to additional losses and dampening market confidence. Conversely, if the bulls can defend this level, it may provide a springboard for upward momentum.  Renewed Selling Pressure Challenges PEPE’s Recovery Efforts PEPE’s price trajectory has encountered renewed selling pressure, casting doubt about its ability to sustain a meaningful recovery. As the price edges closer to the critical $0.00001731 level, bearish sentiment appears to dominate the market. This level now serves as a pivotal support zone, and its breach might exacerbate the downturn, triggering more declines. Related Reading: Bulls Falter As PEPE Slide To $0.00001748: Key Support In Focus Despite recent attempts by bulls to stabilize the price, the overwhelming selling pressure has curtailed recovery efforts. Market participants are closely watching for signs of strength at this support level, as a successful defense could reignite optimism. However, failing to hold above $0.00001731 may signal a prolonged pessimistic phase, leaving PEPE vulnerable to deeper corrections in the near term. Furthermore, the current technical setup suggests the potential for additional downside movement. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are hovering near oversold territory, signaling weak bullish momentum and the possibility of continued selling pressure. Similarly, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) displays bearish crossovers, reinforcing the downward trajectory. Critical Levels To Watch: The Path Ahead For PEPE As PEPE faces renewed bearish pressure, the $0.00001731 support level has become a focal point for its price action. This level holds significant importance, as a strong defense could prompt a reversal, allowing the bulls to reclaim momentum and push the price toward the $0.00002188 resistance level. A successful rebound from $0.00001731 could open the door for more gains, signaling a potential upside recovery. Related Reading: PEPE Hits New All-Time High, Market Cap Surpasses $10 Billion Nonetheless, if the $0.00001731 support level fails to hold, PEPE could experience a more significant decline, with the next crucial support zone at $0.00001313 coming into play. A sustained breach of this level would signal weakness, possibly triggering a negative movement that drives the price down toward the $0.00001152 level. Such a move would indicate a deeper correction in the market and may suggest that the bears are firmly in control, pushing PEPE into a prolonged downward trend.

Amid the drop, an analyst shared his “cautiously bullish” outlook for BTC’s price. Related Reading: ‘ADA Wave Is Coming’: Cardano Whales Go On Buying Spree As Price Attempts Breakout Bitcoin Risks Crash To $74,000 On Tuesday, Bitcoin dropped below $97,000, dragging the market into the first pullback of the year. BTC began 2025 trading around the $92,000 level but climbed around 6.5% in the following days. After turning the $98,000 resistance into support over the weekend, Bitcoin jumped back above $100,000, reaching its highest price in weeks. However, BTC struggled to maintain this key support zone, dipping 3% in an hour yesterday. The cryptocurrency has dropped another 2.5% in the past day, falling as low as $94,500 on Wednesday morning. Since then, BTC has hovered between $94,800 and $95,600, briefly testing the $96,000 resistance. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez examined BTC’s recent performance. In an X threat, the analyst noted that Bitcoin had “breached the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders pattern” on Monday, invalidating the bearish setup pattern. However, the reversal “erased those gains, dragging BTC back below the right shoulder and reigniting bearish concerns,” as this pattern could trigger a correction to at least $78,000. Martinez also pointed out that Bitcoin has fallen below a key demand zone, between $95,400 and $98,400, where 1.77 million addresses acquired over 1.53 million BTC. The analyst suggested the price drop could force these holders to “sell some BTC to cut potential losses.” He also noted there isn’t significant resistance ahead for the flagship crypto, with only a minimal supply wall of 107,000 BTC between $104,700 and $105,770. Nonetheless, the analyst warned that a surge in selling pressure that pushes the cryptocurrency below the $92,000 mark “could spell trouble,” as it would open “the door to a steep drop, with little support until $74,000.” “Therefore, the current market conditions, from a macro perspective, are reigniting fears of a potential Bitcoin crash,” he added. BTC Price Set To Bounce Soon? The analyst also shared a “cautiously bullish” outlook for BTC from a technical perspective. Martinez pointed out that TD Sequential presented a buy signal on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart, suggesting a potential price rebound if the price can hold the $93,500 support zone. Additionally, he highlighted that traders on Binance “are leaning bullish on Bitcoin,” as  61.28% of all traders on the crypto exchange with open positions are betting that the price will go up. Martinez also noted that $35 million would be liquidated if BTC’s price rebounds to $98,600, suggesting that market makers “may try to grab” it. Similarly, there’s another $66 million liquidation zone above $103,300. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Makes $21 Million From AI Agent Token As Sectors Faces Backlash However, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin must reclaim the $100,000 support to invalidate the bearish outlook and “set its sights on new all-time highs.” Martinez concluded that BTC could rebound to $98,600 in the short term, but “the macro suggests caution.” As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,500, a 3.3% retrace in the daily timeframe.

The asset’s price continued its run up to $102,760 before undergoing a healthy correction, pushing it back below $100k.

A funding rate, expressed in percentage, is set by crypto exchanges for their perpetual futures contracts. If this rate is positive, long positions periodically settle short positions; when it’s negative, short positions periodically settle long positions. According to data, the funding rate’s weekly moving average dropped to 0.009%, below the neutral score of 0.10%. This week’s updated funding rate reflects a steep decline from the 0.0026% mid-December, suggesting a cautious investor sentiment for long positions. Is Bitcoin’s Price Rally Sustainable? Coinglass also shared that the assets’ Open Interest-Weighted Funding Rate increased to 0.0058% but was still below January 5th’s high of 0.0113%. Then, Coinshares also revealed that the Volume-Weighted Funding Rate increased to 0.0051%, but still way below a previous high of 0.0111%. Interestingly, the decline in funding rates indicates that most traders are cautious as Bitcoin struggles to hit and keep the $100k mark. Their reluctance to put their money on leveraged exposure means they’re not confident in Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its price surge soon.

At the same time, data from Coinglass shows that over $24 million worth of Dogecoin positions have been liquidated in the ensuing decline in the past 24 hours. Coinglass Data Highlights Extent Of Dogecoin Liquidations According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin liquidations have been among the most significant in the market in the past 24 hours, as leveraged positions failed to withstand the rapid price drop. Particularly, Dogecoin traders lost over $24.37 million in liquidations during the past day, coming in behind only Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana, who have witnessed $136.9 million, $111.54 million, and $31.48 million, respectively, in liquidations.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market Long positions accounted for the majority of liquidations, as bullish traders were caught off guard by the unexpected sell-off. In the case of DOGE, $21.42 million worth of long positions were liquidated, while about $2.95 million worth of short positions were liquidated.  These liquidations have also been accompanied by a strong decline in open interest in Dogecoin futures positions. According to Coinglass data, the open interest on Dogecoin is currently at 10.31 billion DOGE tokens, reflecting a 12.37% decline in a 24-hour timeframe. This corresponding drop in open interest suggests a cautious sentiment among Dogecoin investors as crypto bulls push through double-digit beatdowns. DOGE To Bounce Back? The dominance of liquidated long positions shows how bullish traders were blindsided by the abrupt sell-off, which swiftly erased many of the gains in the previous four days.  This sharp correction has interrupted Dogecoin’s upward momentum, which had been gearing up to break above the $0.40 price level. Instead, Dogecoin bulls now face the challenge of defending key support at $0.35. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Faces ‘Moment Of Truth’ As It Battles The Macro 0.5 Fib Extension Dogecoin’s price action in the past seven days has been characterized by intense activity, with a surge from $0.31 on January 1 to $0.395 on January 7, representing a 27.4% increase in six days. However, the past 24 hours have been riddled by a 10% correction. Nevertheless, Dogecoin continues to hold on to this intense trading activity, with data from Coinmarketcap showing a 90% increase in trading volume in the past 24 hours despite the liquidations. Furthermore, these sorts of liquidations and declines are not unusual for Dogecoin, and many holders have seen them as part and parcel of the market.  Looking ahead, Dogecoin retains the potential for a strong rebound, particularly if bulls can maintain support around the $0.35 level. A recovery in Bitcoin’s price above the critical $100,000 mark could further provide the broader market momentum needed to resume Dogecoin’s rally.  At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3505.

Ethereum: Investment Giant Fidelity Predicts Who Will Lead In 2025,2025-01-08 15:00:44+00:00,"Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of global financial services firm Fidelity Investments, has released a new paper titled “2025 Look Ahead: Is it ‘too late’ to enter digital assets?” The publication dedicates significant attention to the ongoing competition between Ethereum and Solana. Authored by Max Wadington, the section “Ethereum Outlook” provides a close look at fundamental metrics, upcoming network upgrades, and the broader implications for investors heading into 2025. Solana Vs. Ethereum In 2025 In a notable excerpt comparing Solana and Ethereum, Wadington explains: “We think fundamentals are most important for long-term investors. With that said, Ethereum has strong developer activity, total value locked (TVL), and stablecoin supply. Comparatively, Solana’s revenue and TVL are improving at a faster rate than Ethereum’s and seem to have captured significant community mind share this past year.” One factor complicating Solana’s growth trajectory is the provenance of its revenue, which is significantly influenced by memecoin trading. Wadington notes that while “a similar argument could be made for Ethereum’s main use case being Uniswap,” the fundamentals of Ethereum “are slightly less dependent on speculation and may be less volatile over the long term.” Thus, neither platform is risk-free, but Ether’s broader utility may afford it more resilience in bear markets. Related Reading: Solana Back Above Weekly & Monthly Support Levels – Analyst Expects New ATH Despite this, short-term narratives and technical milestones could tip market sentiment in Solana’s favor in 2025. Specifically, Solana’s upcoming Firedancer upgrade “promises a substantial increase in transactions per second (TPS), which may directly enhance Solana’s value proposition.” Ethereum’s Prague/Electra upgrade, meanwhile, “is expected to generate less community hype as it does not significantly impact ether’s value proposition.” Another key differentiator is Ethereum’s presence in US based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a channel of accessibility that helps drive institutional and retail demand. However, Wadington highlights that this advantage “may disappear at some point under the Trump administration,” pending regulatory developments that “could either solidify Ether’s advantage in this area or completely remove it.” Related Reading: Solana Rally Stalls: Pullback To Key Support Signals Potential Correction Ultimately, Wadington suggests that fundamentals may reassert themselves over hype as the market progresses: “Although Solana appears to have more short-term tailwinds than Ether, its relative performance could provide significant upside for ether, similar to how Solana’s prior underperformance provided a substantial runway leading into 2024. As prices get extended throughout this bull market, investors will likely increasingly focus on fundamentals, which may sway them back into ether.” Has Ethereum Made A Misstep? Turning specifically to Ethereum, the paper delves into ongoing debates around Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap. In Wadington’s words: “The rollup-centric roadmap was designed to scale Ethereum while keeping the Layer 1 blockchain easy to run. However, since the Deneb-Cancun upgrade, there has been debate about this decision as Layer 1 fees have plummeted.” While lower fees might appear detrimental to direct revenue for Ether holders, Fidelity’s position is that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term revenue drop. Wadington reiterates: “We continue to believe that revenue from the blob market is unlikely to offset the dramatic decrease in revenue created by the previous upgrade in the short term, yet it still carries long-term positive benefits through improved network effects.” In this view, Ethereum’s ecosystem stands to benefit from a mutualistic relationship with Layer 2s, which inherit Ethereum’s security and liquidity. The foundation’s priority, as Wadington writes, is ensuring “near-zero fees to keep Layer 2s within the Ethereum ecosystem.” This could foster more specialized Layer 2 projects in 2025, as developers customize entire tech stacks for niche use cases such as the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). At press time, Solana traded at $197. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Dominance Fuels $585 Million Crypto ETP Inflows In 2025,2025-01-08 13:30:05+00:00,"Bitcoin and crypto ETPs continue their impressive performance just a week into the new year. According to a CoinShares report filed by James Butterfill, crypto ETPs saw massive $585 million inflows in the first few days of the year. Analysts say this early strong performance of the crypto ETPs continues the impressive run of the assets from last year. Related Reading: SUI Skyrockets: Bullish Momentum Drives Push Toward $6 In the same CoinShares report, crypto ETPs achieved over $44 billion outflows in 2024, with Bitcoin as the most-traded digital asset. Bitcoin saw $38 billion in inflows, representing nearly 30% of all Assets in Management (AUM), while Ethereum picked up pace in the latter half of the year, with net inflows of more than $4.8 billion. Bitcoin ETPs Lead The Pack CoinShare’s James Butterfill shared these findings on the performance of crypto ETPs on the company’s official site and social media pages. The report explained that Bitcoin ETPs were the preferred digital investment product, cornering $38 billion of all Bitcoin AUMs of global ETPs. 2024 saw US$44bn inflows in to crypto ETPs, 2025 off to a good start with US$585m inflows so farhttps://t.co/OczGDBUdph — James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) January 6, 2025 Ethereum ETPs ranked second, receiving roughly $4.8 billion in inflows in 2024, representing 26% of all ETH AUMs of global ETPs. The ETP’s inflows this past year are 2.4 times bigger than what was recorded in 2021 and 60 times bigger than in 2023. Ethereum beats Solana regarding inflows in 2024, with just $69 million, representing only 4% of all assets under management. While Solana’s numbers are small relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it still leads all other altcoins. Approval Of Spot ETFs Helps Increase Inflows The industry saw record-breaking inflows in 2024, which is better than what the bull market experienced in 2021. In 2021, cryptocurrency investment products recorded more than $10 billion in net inflows. In short, last year’s inflows were 4x bigger than the recorded amount in 2021. According to Bufferfill, the surge in global crypto investment products benefited from the US’ approval of spot ETFs for Bitcoin in January 2024. In January 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were followed by eight spot ETFs for Ether on May 22nd. According to recent data, these spot Bitcoin ETFs are the main reasons for the inflows in Bitcoin-related investments. Butterfill also explained that these ETFs will redefine the inflows for crypto investments in the future. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Better Days Ahead For US Bitcoin Spot ETPs Aside from CoinShares, Galaxy Digital also offered a rosy picture of the future of the crypto investments industry. In a report shared last December 31st, 2024, the company boldly predicted that the US spot ETPs market will continue to soar in 2025. The report indicated that this niche will reach $250 billion in AUMs this year. Meanwhile, Alex Thorne of Firmwide Research said Bitcoin ETPs are closing in on US gold ETPs in total value of assets under management. Thorne added that Bitcoin will continue to become one of the top-performing assets on its risk-adjusted basis. Other analysts shared that Ether’s spot ETPs will also surge this year. The Ethereum blockchain will benefit from a Trump presidency and favorable regulatory changes. Featured image from OneSafe, chart from TradingView",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Raises $45M – Is This the Next Meme Coin to 100x?,2025-01-08 12:48:44+00:00,"2025 is shaping up to be the year of the Frog, if presales for Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) are anything to go by. They’re just dollars away from hitting the $45M mark, which suggests that this is the meme coin that could outperform all others this year. Obviously, we can’t predict anything for sure. If we could, we’d be sitting at our beach resort in Cancun with our cocktails with the little umbrellas in it. But our expert opinion, after careful analysis, is that Wall Street Pepe is in pole position to hit 100x in 2025. Why Has Wall Street Pepe Done So Well So Far? Ever since its presale launch back in early December, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has seemingly been on cocaine-fuelled backflips. In a month, it has hit $45M in presales, its token price has shot up to $0.00036644, and its staking APY is 29%. Add to that, the promise by $WEPE’s developers to provide financial insights and insider information normally only seen by the big whales, seems to have lit a rocket under the fledgling crypto meme coin. Which begs the question – where is the ceiling for $WEPE? Is there even one? Suddenly, 100x ROI doesn’t seem such a stretch. If things weren’t going swimmingly enough, Elon Musk seems to have been infected with some frog juice. He’s started tweeting (or X’ing?) about it and talking it up. He also briefly changed his X moniker to Kekius Maximus and changed his avatar picture to a frog. Whatever your opinions are about Musk, you can’t deny that he has some serious influencer beans. When he tweets/X’s about something, people sit up and take notice. WEPE got an Elon boost of almost 20%. Other crypto meme coins offering governance rights, or cat slapping games, kind of pale into comparison when the world’s richest man is promoting your competitor. A Populist Message Adds To The Appeal Wall Street Pepe is also benefiting from the current political and social climate at the moment. A crypto-friendly US President about to take office in less than two weeks, which is giving huge amounts of confidence to the big investors with the deep pockets. But at a time when corporate greed seems to be on the rise, $WEPE suggests a neat solution. Its whitepaper proposes to share the trading and financial insights with the little people, and share in the profits. Kind of like Robin Hood marching into Wall Street with his bow and arrow to demand a fair share of the meme coin profit pie. Buy Your Frog Meme Coins Quickly To Take Advantage of Favourable Rates The next price hike (and presumably reduction in the staking APY is in less than two days from now. This makes today the perfect opportunity to grab some Wall Street Pepe coins for your crypto portfolio. Being a prelaunch, $WEPE isn’t on exchanges yet. It is expected to launch in March, and will be on exchanges then. So for the next couple of months, the only way to buy it is through their website. It’s your lucky day because we’ve made an in-depth guide on how to buy Wall Street Pepe meme coins. A word of caution though – and this is why we emphasize that we can’t make guarantees. If you look at the chart above, you’ll see $WEPE’s daddy, PEPE ($PEPE)’s valuation suddenly drop in December. It’s still a good coin to invest in, and the price is slowly picking up again. But it’s a prime example of how you can never predict anything with absolute certainty, and why you should never invest what you can’t afford to lose. $WEPE is PEPE’s natural successor – the one to take the Pepe family legacy and run with it. It’s definitely running right now, but be prepared for a few possible stumbles along the way. Do Your Own Research And Keep Your Shirt As we stated before though – and it bears repeating – we’re not guaranteeing riches and success. It’s impossible to know for sure what will happen to Wall Street Pepe in the future. We can only cast our meme coin expert eye over its current performance and make confident price predictions. Like our lawyers always tell us to say, do your own independent research. Take no one person’s word as gospel (including the self-proclaimed crypto expert sitting at the bar). Come to your own conclusions. And never, ever invest money you can’t afford to lose. Like your kid’s college fund or your 401K pension.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,solana,"Are meme coins quite literally only a giant pyramid scheme, please explain if not
",2025-01-08 16:11:37,"Edit: perhaps not a ‘pyramid scheme’ but rather MLM marketing 

I was initially thinking meme coins have value to them defined by the strength of the community and what we see today is a decentralization of marketing — if that makes sense.

For example, useless companies/brands are being sold for millions only due to the large audience it has accumulated. Now only a few at the top profit and everyone else gives all their money to them.

With meme coins (ideally speaking) everyone gets a stake of the profit sharing. No one cares about celebrities anymore — so whatever money they could have extracted from us we decided to just form our own community with it and we all have a chance of building together. Also, memes can be viewed as leverage to buy btc (which also implies the coin will have a short lifespan from an individual 'investor')

Of course, I’m leaving out the rug pulling as I’m talking of the what meme coins are supposed to be imo and not what inevitably happens to 99% of coins. But to answer the rug pulling, this is a byproduct of minimal regulations. As the sector grows and some regulation takes place, meme money will converge to the best memes that have proven its proof of concept.

Cool. But here’s where I’m at right now:

1. Memes have almost no intrinsic value
2. People buy a meme for its growth
3. Memes are not a store of value
4. Memes run on another crypto’s blockchain

These equate to the same very thick ceiling for all memes. Once a meme hits a certain MC, it’s basically a wrap for the meme. People don’t see it having quick growth anymore, it’s not a store of value, what if it grew so much you need to spend 1 SOL just to get a fraction of a meme, hey it’s dipping and there actually is not intrinsic value to any of this —> dump

So far, going long on any memecoin after initial hype almost always results in failure. Long as in 5yrs+. Doge is doing ight (although I’m sure most got burned) but only because of Elon.

So, given the above how can meme coins not be a giant pyramid scheme? I’m not even talking about rug pulling here. After an its growth, you have to cash out because memes don’t store value. They only Caveat I see is no one knows when it stops growing — but at the moment mc is a huge indicator.

My only optimistic conclusion so far is Solana just has to explode to increase the ceiling of these coins, and there needs to be a huge barrier for minting new memes thus other coins will have long term value. And I think memes are going to be around because gambling hasn’t gone anywhere.

My question is though, is a ‘strong community’ actually enough to support a meme coin, long term? People want to buy a meme, forget about it, come back 5yrs later and still be up.

* UK-based fintech firm Revolut became the first banking data publisher to join the multi-chain Pyth Network.
* Revolut will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth price feeds, allowing DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

Crypto-friendly fintech firm Revolut has become the first banking data publisher to join the Pyth Network.

 — a provider of real-time market data for onchain applications.

Revolut, which boasts over 45 million users across 200 countries, will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth’s price feeds, enabling DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

“Our partnership with Pyth is an important milestone in Revolut's journey to modernize finance,” Revolut Global Business Head of Crypto Mazen Eljundi said. “By working with Pyth to provide our reliable market data to applications, Revolut can influence digital economies by ensuring developers and users have access to the precise, real-time information they need.”

As a Pyth oracle network publisher, the digital banking platform will help secure the operations of hundreds of dapps, which can now access over 500 real-time feeds for digital and traditional assets, responsible for more than $1 trillion in total traded volume during 2024, according to a statement shared with The Block.

Other Pyth data publishers include Amber Group, Binance, Bitstamp, Bybit, Cboe, Cumberland DRW, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, Jane Street, OKX, Raydium and Wintermute.

“Pyth’s collaboration with Revolut is part of a larger trend we’re seeing, where traditional banking institutions, trusted by millions of customers globally, are recognizing the value of decentralized finance and digital assets,” Michael Cahill, CEO and co-founder of Douro Labs, core contributor to the Pyth Network, said. “Together, we are driving the future of finance, where transparent and reliable data empowers the next generation of financial applications.”

Originally designed for the Solana blockchain, Pyth Network now operates across more than 80 blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Aptos and Sui, providing real-time market data for cryptocurrencies, equities, FX and commodities.

# Revolut’s expanding crypto initiatives

In May 2024, the fintech firm launched a standalone crypto trading platform, Revolut X, in the UK, subsequently [expanding](https://www.theblock.co/post/326175/revolut-expands-crypto-exchange-30-markets) to 30 European countries in November. In September, Revolut was also [reported to be](https://www.theblock.co/post/317166/uk-fintech-firm-revolut-intends-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin-report) in the process of launching its own stablecoin.

Revolut [secured](https://www.theblock.co/post/307389/crypto-friendly-fintech-revolut-secures-banking-license-from-uk-financial-regulator) a banking license from the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority in July 2024, after a three-year application process. Obtaining a UK banking license is notoriously difficult due to the stringent regulatory and compliance requirements imposed by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority.

For several decades, the UK banking sector was dominated by large, established institutions, and no new banking licenses were granted until Metro Bank in 2010. The Bank of Dave campaign following the 2008 financial crisis highlighted the challenges of entering the sector, and subsequent reforms helped pave the way for several other new banks, including Monzo and Starling, which disrupted the market.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,solana,Had to use all my Solana funds to pay a vet bill,2025-01-07 22:26:53,"My Dog (16 months) has been biting at his backside and back legs for the last almost two weeks. For a while it just looked like he was chasing his tail so I didn't think much of it but over time he was doing it more and more and then he would start chewing on his back legs while whining so I ended up to him to the vet and it turns out he had parasites (most likely from eating something off the ground outside)

The bill ended up being almost $300 and my work always slows down to a crawl in the beginning months of the year so I had to use whatever I had in my solana chain which was around $200 to help cover the cost. I'm happy I was able to get my dog the help he needed but I'm also devastated that my crypto is gone.

This is my first time getting into crypto and this setback just makes me think that this isn't for me. Has anyone else struggled from not using their crypto so it can actually grow? And if so how did you come back from losing it all?",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

I understand arbitrage but need some assistance with the more technical aspects of coding the bot. Looking forward to learning a lot on my own and contributing what I can to the project. All code will be shared in a private github repo so that the developers can use it on their own machines or servers once it is working and tested. No telegram. I will host a discord server or something else that cannot be taken down. Everyone can fork the repo as long as it remains private and all forks are private when we are finished. No one will be asked to contribute money at any time. Everyone will work on either planning, logic, coding, or optimization. Your payment is the finished project which only the small dev team will have access to. My knowledge is limited so don't be intimidated, just ready to learn and contribute what you can. There are no time constraints. It will be done when it is as profitable as we can practically make it. Again, no money or crypto will be exchanged between any members of the dev team. Wsl, debian based hyperv or other vm, or bare metal Linux will be required. Knowledge on Linux is not required as it is easy to learn for what we are trying to do. No scammers allowed. Got burned and not letting it happen again. Leave helpful comments with suggestions for finding a team or if you are interested in joining the team. Let's try to make some passive income and learn a little along the way. ",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
Reddit,solana,Can’t find grass tokens after swapping with usdc on raydium,2025-01-08 07:56:47,"I swapped Usdc for grass tokens on raydium but I am unable to find where my grass tokens are. I put my trust wallet's solana address expecting it to show up there but I cannot find it. It says the transaction is a success, however there are a couple indicators that I am unsure about the reliability of this transaction.

I connected the same wallet to radium on my laptop and the transaction was not on my history but only on my phone. I have linked a photo below of what it looks like.

The USDC from my account is gone but the grass tokens are nowhere to be found.

Does anyone know what happened? Thanks

Reddit,solana,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-07 13:22:55,"Hey fam, happy new year. This was popular on r/Solidity, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT:*** *The deadline to apply was just extended from to January 11th!*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

LMK if you have any questions, the team or I can try to give more info.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
Reddit,solana,Solana team or insider setting up trade bots raking in millions if not billions,2025-01-08 00:29:53,I’ve come to the conclusion that solana chain company or an insider has thousands of MEV trade bots scamming people out of millions if not billions. There are so many of these bots constantly trading making millions of profit within a month and they move faster than any other bot program you can think of.. meaning they have direct access to the data hub/ nodes as possible. I may have to hang my hat on this memecoin trend.. haven’t fully decided. Not as bullish as I once was. This will all come crashing down at some point.,2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,solana,Solana's SIMD-215 Proposal: A Major Step Toward Blockchain Scalability and Quantum Resistance,2025-01-07 16:19:23,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my thoughts on an exciting development I came across in the blockchain space: Solana's SIMD-215 proposal. This update aims to solve some of the most significant challenges in blockchain scalability.

At its core, SIMD-215 introduces Solana's Accounts Lattice Hash system, which addresses inefficient account state updates. By using homomorphic hashing, the network only updates what’s changed, instead of recalculating the entire state from scratch. This approach allows for:

Improved efficiency 👍

The ability to support billions of accounts 😳

Enhanced security, with 128-bit encryption and quantum resistance

What stands out to me is not only how Solana is solving current scalability issues, but also how it's preparing for future threats, like quantum computing. This could be a game-changer in making blockchain networks more secure and scalable for widespread adoption.

What do you all think about this approach? Do you believe scalability is the key to blockchain reaching mainstream adoption, or are there other factors at play?

Reddit,solana,Rust (Now Go) Trading Platform from Scratch - Update 3,2025-01-07 19:12:57,"The second update:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust\_trading\_platform\_from\_scratch\_update\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust_trading_platform_from_scratch_update_2/)

Moving these posts over to here instead of r/algotrading  because I think there are some folks here who could benefit from it.

I've been building an algotrading and fraud detection/chain analysis system in Rust for the last several months. Despite loving Rust, I immediately started running into some significant issues with the language and this application.

**the issues**

Rust is very good. It's very fast, incredibly memory efficient, and has lots of libraries required to build onchain. Solana is built on it, obviously.

The issue that Rust has is working with unstructured data, or data whose structure is pretty difficult to define. I wanted to build out a custom parser for transactions, and the going was incredibly slow and painful. Between parsing bytes and converting them to different data types to dealing with weird memory footguns, it became so annoying to write that I genuinely left the project alone for a week or two.

Everyone on r/algotrading was recommending Golang. I'd written some serverless lambda applications in Golang, and really liked it. It's like taking the ease of use of Python and adding the speed and power of Rust or C. Yes, it's garbage collected and therefore probably a wee bit slower than Rust, but the difference was basically ""not finish a very fast solution in Rust"" or ""finish a fairly fast solution in Golang"" and I've seen how dumb a lot of ya'll are, I'm not going to need breakneck speed to win in this market and do a lot of the analytical work I'm trying to do. I also have a vision of a system where Golang does all the data fetching and structuring and Rust does all of the data analytics, but that's long down the road.

**golang rules**

I started the Golang conversion yesterday, and I'm already close to achieving relative parity with my Rust codebase. I also get to use Raylib for data visualization, which seems to be much more mature than Bevy, the game engine I was using in Rust.

**lesson: dev speed isn't just about how quickly you can get something out there**

The dev speed in Rust was so bad that I literally found myself not wanting to work on the project. I spent ages just figuring out how to make the memory management work instead of adding features. I still believe Rust is a fantastic language, but I don't think I'm going to go back to it for projects that require a lot of unstructured data parsing. I just develop better software, faster, using Go right now.

**the overall plan**

I'm going to get the basics of wallet visualization and management working first and then work on the trading engine. I've got a shared RPC node with a ton of available bandwidth, so I've got a lot of leeway to test and gather data with.

After that, I'm going to build out the data vis layer at the same time as the trading engine. I think it'll be helpful to be able to visualize other wallets and their strategies while I develop my own, and I have a few wallets I want to look into.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,solana,Want to know how I've already made over 100k this year?,2025-01-06 00:44:01,"
I'm feeling generous with a secret.
 
Go through and check out new coins being made on Dexscreener. Search the creator wallets until you find rug factory wallets. Then,  hit up SolanaFM, enter their wallet address and watch them transfer profits to a bew address. Follow the new one, you'll see them make a new coin and you can get the CA minutes before its posted on Dex. SolanaFM shows the token name and CA before it migrates to Dexscreener which gives you time to enter the CA into your your market and spam the buy till your order goes through. 

This has given me the chance at being the first buyer many many times.  I buy around 2 to 20 sol worth, then sell before the rug factory dump.The factoey usually follows a pattern of when they dump. The last one was at 60% market cap OR immediate rug (yep, still risk involved). Typically 3 out of 10 new coins they create will autosell at creation.

The times they dont, I sell at 40k or 50k marketcap as this factory trended at 60k. The profits are better than you'll believe, especially at 20 sol buy in. 

 
Once they rug, I watch that wallet send their profits to a new wallet and then start a new coin and I do it all over again.

Ever wondered how tokens work on the Solana blockchain? What does a “create token account” transaction mean?

https://preview.redd.it/nj77i7j1mgbe1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5c450c74be676992742c1c1438a82288d852ec

Unlike some other blockchains, Solana uses a special system called “associated token accounts” to handle tokens efficiently and securely. Let’s break it down in a way that’s easy to understand, with examples you can relate to!

# What Is an Associated Token Account (ATA)?

Imagine you’ve got a locker at school. Each locker is labeled with your name and can only store one type of item — say books, snacks, or gym clothes. On Solana, an associated token account is like your personal locker for a specific token. It’s tied to your wallet (your unique ID) and can only hold one kind of token, like USDC or Bonk or Pengu.

This setup keeps everything organized and easy to find. It also ensures that tokens are stored safely in the right place.

# Why Do You Need an ATA?

Here’s the deal: before you can use a token — whether to buy something, trade, or receive an airdrop — you need a specific locker (an ATA) for that token. Without it, you’d have nowhere to store the token! Let’s look at some reasons why this is important:

1. **Organization:** Everyone’s tokens are stored in their own lockers, so it’s clear who owns what.
2. **Compatibility:** Apps and games on Solana know where to look for your tokens because ATAs follow a standard design.
3. **Simplicity:** You don’t need to manually manage different accounts. The system does it for you!

# How Do You Create an ATA?

Typically, ATAs are created automatically as a part of a buy or transfer transaction. All wallets, trading platforms, and bots handle this for you.

However, sometimes users might want to create an ATA in a separate transaction:

1. This can make your buy or transfer transaction “smaller,” which increases the chances of it being processed faster — especially during times of high network traffic.
2. On the flip side, some spammers take advantage of this system by creating lots of unnecessary ATA transactions trying to trick other people into buying their tokens.

Associated token accounts might sound complicated at first, but they’re really just a clever way to keep track of tokens on Solana. Think of them as your personal lockers — safe, organized, and ready for anything. Whether you’re playing games, trading, or just holding tokens, ATAs make it all work smoothly.

So next time you hear about “create associated token account” transactions, you’ll know it’s just Solana setting up a locker for your tokens. Easy, right? Now go out there and explore the world of Solana!",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

# Introduction

*“We knew smaller, faster, cheaper better than anybody else in the world, and now we're applying those concepts to blockchain.” — Greg Fitzgerald, Solana co-founder*

Solana is a high-performance, low-latency blockchain renowned for its speed, efficiency, and focus on user experience. Its unique integrated architecture enables thousands of transactions per second across a globally decentralized network. With a block time of 400 milliseconds and transaction fees that are fractions of a cent, it delivers on both speed and cost-effectiveness. This report delves into the intricacies of Solana's design and operation, exploring the key mechanisms and network topology that contribute to its capabilities.

Solana takes an integrated approach to blockchain development, leveraging the founding team's decades of experience in building distributed systems. One of Solana's core principles is that software should never get in the way of hardware. This means that software exploits whatever hardware it runs on to the fullest and scales with it. As a unified ecosystem, all applications built on top of this single blockchain inherit composability, enabling them to interact and build upon each other seamlessly. This architecture also ensures a straightforward and intuitive user experience without the need for bridging, separate chain IDs, or liquidity fragmentation.

https://preview.redd.it/kc6staudogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2c5dc96b71a597fda65fc0b623806f1e4c0d0e0

Solana is evolving rapidly, with recent developments including SVM rollups and [ZK Compression](https://www.zkcompression.com/) as important scaling solutions. While these projects may one day shape our future perception of Solana, they are currently in the very early stages of development or adoption and will not be covered in this report.

# Transaction Lifecycle

Our primary lens for understanding Solana throughout this report will be the lifecycle of a typical transaction. To construct a basic model for understanding Solana transactions, we can outline the process as follows: 

https://preview.redd.it/y27ncoggogbe1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f24f7d74ee34e53e7e15ad616c291587de0885b

* Users initiate transactions, all of which are sent to the current lead block producer (known as the leader). The leader compiles these transactions into a block, executing them and thereby updating their local state.
* This block of transactions is then propagated throughout the network for other validators to execute and confirm.

The subsequent sections of this report will expand this model and delve into this process in much greater detail, beginning with the key participants—the users.

# Remember

*Substantial changes to the core Solana protocol go through a formal, transparent* [*process*](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md) *of submitting a Solana Improvement Document (SIMD) which community members and core engineering will publicly critique. SIMDs are then voted on by the network.*

# Six stages

https://preview.redd.it/bb6i7wxjogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d445455affd3993d91da00bf732ea4c01128a7

We will reference the six-stage visual shown above throughout this report, as it offers us a consistent framework for understanding the relationships between Solana's core elements.

Earlier chapters are arranged according to these six stages. The final chapters—Gossip, Archive, Economics, and Jito—tie up any loose ends. It’s important to note that some chapters will span multiple stages, and some stages will appear in multiple chapters.

This overlap is unavoidable because the six-stage framework has its limitations. In reality, Solana is a complex distributed system with many interdependent elements.

# Users

*“Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto” — Raj Gokal, Solana co-founder*

A user's journey typically begins by setting up and funding a wallet application. Multiple popular wallet applications are available for Solana, either as native mobile applications or browser extensions.

Wallets cryptographically generate user keypairs, consisting of public and private keys. The public key acts as the unique identifier for their account and is known by all participants in the network. A user’s account on Solana can be considered a data structure that holds information and state related to their interactions with the Solana blockchain. In this way, a public key is similar to a filename: just as a filename uniquely identifies a file within a file system, a Solana public key uniquely identifies an account on the Solana blockchain. Public keys on Solana are represented as 32-byte Base58-encoded strings.

`FDKJvWcJNe6wecbgDYDFPCfgs14aJnVsUfWQRYWLn4Tn`

A private key — also known as a secret key —can be considered as the password or access key that grants permission to access and modify the account. Signing with private keys is how blockchains handle authorization. Knowledge of the private key gives absolute authority over the account. Solana private keys are also 32-bytes in length. Keypairs are the 64-byte combinations of public (first half) and private (second half) keys. Examples:

`3j15jr41S9KmdfughusutvvqBjAeEDbU5sDQp8EbwQ3Hify2pfM1hiEsuFFAVq8bwGywnZpswrbDzPENbBZbd5nj`

`[63,107,47,255,141,135,58,142,191,245,78,18,90,162,107,197,8,33,211,15,228,235,250,30,185,122,105,23,147,115,115,86,8,155,67,155,110,51,117,0,19,150,143,217,132,205,122,91,167,61,6,246,107,39,51,110,185,81,13,81,16,182,30,71]`

Private keys can also be derived from mnemonic seed phrases, usually 12 or 24 words long. This format is often used in wallets for easier backup and recovery. Multiple keys can be derived deterministically from a single seed phrase.

Solana utilizes [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519), a widely used elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, for its public-key cryptography needs. Ed25519 is favored for its small key size, small signature size, fast computation, and immunity to many common attacks. Each Solana wallet address represents a point on the Ed25519 elliptic curve.

https://preview.redd.it/astjuuasogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7094772d293060d90b5e9e70e2d4c65a13fe3a

The user signs transactions with their private key. This signature is included with the transaction data and can be verified by other participants using the sender's public key. This process ensures the transaction has not been tampered with and is authorized by the owner of the corresponding private key. The signature also acts as a unique identifier for the transaction.

# Solana Transactions

Sending a transaction is the only way to mutate state on Solana. Any write operation is performed through a transaction, and transactions are atomic—either everything the transaction attempts to do happens or the transaction fails. A transaction, more formally known as a ""transaction message,"" comprises four sections: a header, a list of account addresses, a recent blockhash, and instructions.

https://preview.redd.it/yl7lvpouogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5349733808055e00bf0a209ed2174abd529619d7

* Header: The header contains references to the account address list, indicating which accounts must sign the transaction.
* Account Addresses: This list includes all the accounts that will be read from or written to during the transaction. Building such a list for every transaction is a requirement unique to Solana and can be challenging for developers. However, knowing in advance which pieces of state a transaction will interact with enables optimizations not possible on many other blockchains.
* Recent Blockhash: This is used to prevent duplicate and stale transactions. A recent blockhash expires after 150 blocks (about 1 minute). By default, RPCs attempt to forward transactions every 2 seconds until the transaction is either finalized or the recent blockhash expires, at which point the transaction is dropped.
* Instructions: These form the core part of the transaction. Each instruction represents a specific operation (e.g., transfer, mint, burn, create account, close account). Each instruction specifies the program to execute, the accounts required, and the data needed for the instruction's execution.

The number of instructions in a transaction is limited first by its size, which can be up to 1,232 bytes. There are also limits around the number of accounts that can be referenced. Lastly, there are limits to a transaction’s complexity measured in compute units (CUs). CUs quantify the computational resources expended in processing transactions.

# Remember

*The smallest unit of SOL is known as a ""lamport,"" equivalent to one billionth of a SOL, similar to a satoshi in Bitcoin. The lamport is named after* [*Leslie Lamport*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)*, a computer scientist and mathematician whose research established many theoretical foundations of modern distributed systems.*

The cost in SOL to execute a transaction is separated into 2 parts - a base fee and a prioritization fee. The base fee is a fixed 5000 lamports per signature cost irrespective of the transaction’s complexity—usually, there is 1 signature per transaction.

Prioritization fees are technically optional, but during periods of high demand for blockspace become necessary. These fees are priced in micro-lamports (millionth of a lamport) per compute unit. Their purpose is to act as a price signal, making transactions more economically compelling for validator nodes to include in their blocks. 

`total fee = prioritization fee + base fee`

`prioritization fee = compute unit price (micro-lamports) x compute unit limit`

Currently, 50% of all transaction-related fees are burnt, permanently removing this SOL from circulation with the remaining 50% going to the block producer. A new change (SIMD 96) is soon to be introduced allowing for 100% of prioritization fees to go to the block producer. Base fees remain unchanged.

# Sending transactions

https://preview.redd.it/ciea7ftyogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0407e01298915f6b4310da6b5271465500f8be7d

A user connects their wallet to the application, allowing the app to read the user’s public key. The private key remains encrypted and securely sandboxed in a separate environment from the application.

The application builds the transaction message parameters based on the user’s interactions. For example, if a user wanted to swap two tokens, they would specify the amount of tokens to buy, the corresponding tokens to sell, and an acceptable transaction slippage.

‍Once the transaction message is ready, it is sent to the wallet to be signed with the user’s private key. At this point, the user is prompted with a popup to confirm their willingness to transact. This popup may include a simulation of the transaction’s results. Once signed, the transaction message and the signature are returned to the app, which can then forward the transaction to an RPC provider of their choice, either their own or by using the wallet’s provider.

‍RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers act as intermediaries between applications and the validators that build blocks. They are an essential service that enables applications to [submit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/cd6f931223181d5a1d47cba64e857785a175a760/rpc/src/rpc.rs#L3396) or simulate signed transactions and efficiently retrieve on-chain data. Applications that wish to interact with the network do so via a JSON-RPC or a WebSocket endpoint ([docs](https://solana.com/docs/rpc)).

# Remember

*The term “failed transaction” on Solana is misleading and has caused considerable confusion. These transactions incur fees and are executed successfully by the runtime exactly as the signer intended. They “fail” due to the transaction’s own logic requiring them to do so. +80% of “failed” transactions come from error code 0x1771, the code for exceeding slippage amount (*[*data*](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/zapokorny/q/18zuYlugBdcm/solana-failed-txs-by-program)*). Notably, 95% of these transactions are submitted by only 0.1% of active Solana addresses, primarily automated bots attempting to take advantage of time-sensitive price arbitrage opportunities.*

# Gulf Stream

*“Literally the goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world — so speed of light through fiber. Who we’re competing with is NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) refer to RPC nodes. These nodes can be thought of as gateways to interact with and read data from the network. They run the same software as full validators but with different settings, allowing them to accurately simulate transactions and maintain an up-to-date view of the current state. As of this writing, there are over 4,000 RPC nodes on the Solana network.

‍Unlike full validator nodes, RPC nodes do not hold any stake in the network. Without stake, they cannot vote or build blocks. This setup differs from most other blockchains, where the validator and RPC nodes are typically the same. Since RPC nodes do not receive staking rewards, the economics of running RPC nodes are distinct from those of validators with many operating as a paid service for developers running Solana applications.

‍Solana stands out because it was designed from the outset to operate without a mempool. Unlike traditional blockchains that use gossip protocols to randomly and broadly propagate transactions across the network, Solana forwards all transactions to a predetermined lead validator, known as the leader, for each slot.

https://preview.redd.it/efimg7g5pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ddc929f7c96b3eb528f3d8768388853e1c62db

# Callout

*Solana operates four clusters: Localnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet-Beta. When people refer to Solana or the Solana network, they almost always refer to Mainnet-Beta. Mainnet-Beta is the only cluster where tokens hold real value, while the other clusters are used solely for testing purposes.*

‍Once an RPC receives a transaction message to be included in a block, it must be forwarded to the leader. A leader schedule is produced before every epoch (approximately every two days). The upcoming epoch is divided into slots, each fixed at 400 milliseconds, and a leader is chosen for each slot. Validators with a higher stake will be chosen more often to become leader within each epoch. During each slot, transaction messages are forwarded to the leader, who has the opportunity to produce a block. When it is a validator’s turn, they switch to ""leader mode,"" begin actively processing transactions and broadcasting blocks to the rest of the network.

# ‍Stake-Weighted Quality of Service - SWQoS

‍In early 2024, Solana introduced a new mechanism aimed at preventing spam and enhancing Sybil resistance, known as ""Stake-Weighted Quality of Service"" (SWQoS). This system enables leaders to prioritize transaction messages that are proxied through other staked validators. Here, validators with a higher stake are granted a proportionally higher capacity to transmit transaction message packets to the leader. This approach effectively mitigates Sybil attacks from non-staked nodes across the network.

https://preview.redd.it/gacy1qn8pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e510254be8f3dfe4465bb02297771ec19e98024

Under this model, validators can also engage in agreements to lease their stake-weighted capacity to RPC nodes. In return, RPC nodes gain increased bandwidth, allowing them to achieve greater transaction inclusion rates in blocks. Notably, 80% of a leader’s capacity (2,000 connections) is reserved for SWQoS. The remaining 20% (500 connections) is allocated for transaction messages from non-staked nodes. This allocation strategy mirrors priority lanes on highways, where drivers pay a toll to avoid traffic.

‍SWQoS has impacted the Solana ecosystem by raising the requirements to forward transactions to the leader and reducing the effectiveness of spam attacks. The change has incentivized high-traffic applications to vertically integrate their operations. By running their own validator nodes, or by having access to staked connections, applications can ensure privileged access to the leader, thereby enhancing their transaction processing capabilities.

# ‍A QUIC Note

‍In late 2022, Solana adopted the [QUIC networking protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to manage transaction message transmission to the leader. This transition was prompted by network disruptions caused by bots spamming on-chain NFT mints. QUIC facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication.

https://preview.redd.it/hqfeng0bpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a7002fb6203d3e7535299c6a4340f55cc8927d

Initially developed by [Google](https://research.google/pubs/the-quic-transport-protocol-design-and-internet-scale-deployment/) in 2012, QUIC attempts to offer the best of both worlds. It facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication similar to UDP, but with the secure sessions and advanced flow control strategies of TCP. This allows for limits to be placed on individual sources of traffic so that the network can focus on processing genuine transactions. It also has a concept of separate streams; so if one transaction is dropped, it doesn’t need to block the remaining ones. In short, QUIC can be thought of as attempting to combine the best characteristics of TCP and UDP.

# ‍Callout box

*Stake-weighting is a recurring principle found throughout Solana's systems, encompassing voting rewards, turbine trees, leader schedules, Gulf Stream, and the gossip network. Validators with greater stake are accorded higher trust and prioritized roles in the network.*

# ‍Block Building

*“We consider SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) the best in terms of virtual machine technology currently.” — Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation*

Many blockchain networks construct entire blocks before broadcasting them, known as discrete block building. Solana, in contrast, employs continuous block building which involves assembling and streaming blocks dynamically as they are created during an allocated time slot, significantly reducing latency.

‍Each slot lasts 400 milliseconds, and each leader is assigned four consecutive slots (1.6 seconds) before rotation to the next leader. For a block to gain acceptance, all transactions within it must be valid and reproducible by other nodes.

‍Two slots before assuming leadership, a validator halts transaction forwarding to prepare for its upcoming workload. During this interval, inbound traffic spikes, reaching over a gigabyte per second as the entire network directs packets to the incoming leader.

‍Upon receipt, transaction messages enter the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), the validator's core logic responsible for block production. Here, the transaction processing sequence begins with the Fetch Stage, where transactions are received via QUIC. Subsequently, transactions progress to the SigVerify Stage, undergoing rigorous validation checks. Here the validator verifies the validity of signatures, checks for the correct number of signatures, and eliminates duplicate transactions.

https://preview.redd.it/tfq1r9pfpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07e829c1264f29fab5b9e1752ad2ec1048b3593

# Banking Stage

The banking stage can be described as the block-building stage. It is the most important stage of the TPU, which gets its name from the “bank“. A bank is just the state at a given block. For every block, Solana has a bank that is used to access state at that block. When a block becomes finalized after enough validators vote on it, they will flush account updates from the bank to disk, making them permanent. The final state of the chain is the result of all confirmed transactions. This state can always be recreated from the blockchain history deterministically.

‍Transactions are processed in parallel and packaged into ledger “entries,” which are batches of 64 non-conflicting transactions. Parallel transaction processing on Solana is made easy because each transaction must include a complete list of all the accounts it will read and write to. This design choice places a burden on developers but allows the validator to avoid race conditions by easily selecting only non-conflicting transactions for execution within each entry. Transactions conflict if they both attempt to write to the same account (two writes) or if one attempts to read from and the other writes to the same account (read + write). Thus conflicting transactions go into different entries and are executed sequentially, while non-conflicting transactions are executed in parallel.

‍There are six threads processing transactions in parallel, with four dedicated to normal transactions and two exclusively handling vote transactions which are integral to Solana’s consensus mechanism. All parallelization of processing is achieved through multiple CPU cores; validators have no GPU requirements ([docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements)).

‍Once transactions have been grouped into entries, they are ready to be executed by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The accounts necessary for the transaction are locked; checks are run to confirm the transaction is recent but hasn’t already been processed. The accounts are loaded, and the transaction logic is executed, updating the account states. A hash of the entry will be sent to the Proof of History service to be recorded (more on this in the next section). If the recording process is successful, all changes will be committed to the bank, and the locks on each account placed in the first step are lifted. Execution is done by the SVM, a virtual machine built using the Solana fork of [rBPF](https://docs.rs/solana_rbpf/latest/solana_rbpf/), a library for working with JIT compilation, and virtual machines for eBPF programs. Note Solana does not mandate how validators choose to order transactions within a block. This flexibility is a crucial point that we will return to later in the Economics + Jito section of this report.

# ‍Remember

*The term SVM can be ambiguous, as it may refer to either the ""Solana Virtual Machine"" or the ""Sealevel Virtual Machine."" Both terms describe the same concept, with Sealevel being the name of Solana's runtime environment. The term SVM continues to be loosely thrown around despite recent efforts to precisely* [*define its boundaries*](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/anzas-new-svm-api)*.*

# ‍Clients

‍Solana is a network comprising thousands of independently operated nodes collaborating to maintain a single unified ledger. Each node constitutes a high-performance machine running the same open-source software known as a “client”.

‍Solana launched with a single validator client software — originally the Solana Labs client, now known as the [Agave client ](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave)— written in Rust. Expanding client diversity has been a priority ever since and one that will truly come to fruition with the launch of the [Firedancer client](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer). Firedancer is a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language. Built by an experienced team from high-frequency trading firm Jump, it promises to be the most performant validator client on any blockchain.

https://preview.redd.it/c1jtsnikpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f25b5a0c4bab8b408d32adf46449cd8e28887e

# Proof of History

*“I had two coffees and a beer, and I was up until 4:00 AM. I had this eureka moment that puzzle \[sic\] similar to proof of work using the same SHA-256 preimage-resistant hash function… I knew that I had this arrow of time.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Proof of History (PoH) is Solana's secret sauce, functioning like a special clock in every validator that facilitates synchronization across the network. PoH establishes a reliable source of truth for the order of events and the passage of time. Most critically it ensures adherence to the leader schedule. Despite similar names, Proof of History is not a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work.

https://preview.redd.it/5m9vzdnppgbe1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b68f99530f62595829ba76bdf159cb127f2940

Communication overhead between nodes typically increases as networks expand, and coordination becomes increasingly complicated. Solana mitigates this by replacing node-to-node communication with a PoH local computation. This means validators can commit to a block with just a single round of voting. Trusted timestamps in messages ensure that validators cannot step over each other and start their blocks prematurely.

Underlying PoH are the unique properties of hashing algorithms, specifically [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2):

* **Deterministic:** The same input will always produce the same hash.
* **Fixed Size:** Regardless of input size, the output hash is always 256 bits.
* **Efficient:** It is fast to compute the hash for any given input.
* [**Preimage Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack)**:** Finding the original input from the hash output is computationally infeasible.
* **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input (even a single bit) results in a significantly different hash, a property known as the avalanche effect.
* [**Collision Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance)**:** It is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

Within each validator client, a dedicated ""Proof of History service"" continually runs the SHA256 hash algorithm creating a chain of hashes. Each hash’s input is the previous hash's output. This chain acts the same as a verifiable delay function, given that the hashing work must be done in sequence and the results of future hashes cannot be known ahead of time. If the PoH service creates a chain of a thousand hashes, we know time has passed for it to have calculated each hash sequentially — this can be thought of as a “micro proof of work.” Yet, other validators can verify the correctness of the thousand hashes in parallel at a much faster rate than they were produced since the input and output of each hash have been broadcast to the network. Therefore, PoH is difficult to produce but easy to verify.

The range of performance in computing SHA-256 across different CPUs is surprisingly narrow, with only small differences among the fastest machines. A common upper limit has already been reached, despite significant time and effort being invested in optimizing this function, largely due to Bitcoin's reliance on it.

https://preview.redd.it/p1t6rq7rpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddadf711c11df6317b747e41a541200de8fb6eab

During a leader’s slot, the PoH service will receive newly processed entries from the banking stage. The current PoH hash plus a hash of all transactions in the entry are combined into the next PoH hash. This serves as a timestamp that inserts the entry into the chain of hashes, proving the sequence in which transactions were processed. This process not only confirms the passage of time but also serves as a cryptographic record of the transactions.

In a single block, there are 800,000 hashes. The PoH stream also includes ""ticks,"" which are empty entries indicating the leader's liveness and the passage of time approximating a small fraction of a second. A tick occurs every 6.25 milliseconds, resulting in 64 ticks per block and a total block time of 400 milliseconds.

Validators continually run the PoH clock even when they are not the leader as it plays a pivotal role in the process of synchronization between nodes.

# Remember

*The key benefit of PoH is that it ensures the correct leader schedule must be adhered to, even if a block producer is offline — a state known as being “delinquent”. PoH prevents a malicious validator from producing blocks before their turn.*

# Accounts Model

*“Separating code and state in SVM was the best design decision. Blessed are the embedded system devs that religiously drilled this concept into my brain.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Within a Solana validator, the global state is maintained in the accounts database known as AccountsDB. This database is responsible for storing all accounts, both in memory and on disk. The primary data structure in the account index is a hashmap, making AccountsDB essentially a vast [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database). Here, the key is the account address, and the value is the account data.

‍Over time the number of Solana accounts has surged into the hundreds of millions. This large number is partly because, as Solana developers are fond of saying, ""Everything on Solana is an account!""

https://preview.redd.it/od9jdizvpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad934df81448f583fc49d29e7306cef5a4dc505

# Solana accounts

‍An account is a container that persistently holds data, similar to a file on a computer. They come in various forms:

‍User accounts: These accounts have a private key and are typically generated by a wallet software for a user.

* Data accounts: These accounts store state information, such as the number of a specific token a user holds.
* Program accounts: These are larger accounts that contain executable bytecode, somewhat equivalent to a .exe file on Windows or a .app file on Mac.
* Native program accounts: These are special pre-deployed program accounts that perform various core functionalities of the network. [Examples](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/programs) include the Vote Program and the BPF Loader.

‍All accounts have the following fields:

https://preview.redd.it/ek1vnit0qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c085da69525391de492cb3eb50db8d3fea40a330

# Programs

Solana program accounts contain only executable logic. This means when a program is run it mutates the state of other accounts but remains unchanged itself. This separation of code and state differentiates Solana from other blockchains and supports many of its optimizations. Developers primarily write these programs in Rust, a general-purpose programming language [known](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf) for its strong focus on safety and performance. Additionally, multiple SDKs in [TypeScript](https://www.helius.dev/blog/build-solana-programs-with-typescript-poseidon) and Python are available to facilitate the creation of application front-ends and enable programmatic interaction with the network.

‍Many common functionalities are provided out-of-the-box by native programs. For example, Solana does not require developers to deploy code to create a token. Instead, instructions are sent to a pre-deployed native program that will set up an account to store the token’s metadata, effectively creating a new token.

# ‍Rent

‍Rent is a mechanism designed to incentivize users to close accounts and reduce state bloat. To create a new account, a minimum balance of SOL, known as the ""rent-exempt"" amount, must be held by the account. This can be considered a storage cost incurred to keep the account alive in a validator's memory. If the size of the account's data increases, the minimum balance rent requirement increases proportionally. When an account is no longer needed, it can be closed, and the rent is returned to the account owner. 

‍For example, if a user holds a dollar-denominated stablecoin, this state is stored in a token account. Currently, the rent-exempt amount for a token account is 0.002 SOL. If the user transfers their entire stablecoin balance to a friend, the token account can be closed, and the user will receive back their 0.002 SOL. Programs often handle account closures automatically for users. Several applications are available to help users clean up old, unused accounts and reclaim the small amounts of SOL stored in them.

# ‍Ownership

‍While reading account data is universally permitted, Solana's ownership model enhances security by restricting exactly who can modify (write) an account's data. This concept is crucial for enforcing rules and permissions on the Solana blockchain. Every account has a program ""owner"". The owner of an account is responsible for governing it, ensuring that only authorized programs can change the account's data. A notable exception to this rule is the transfer of lamports (the smallest unit of SOL)—increasing an account's lamports balance is universally permitted, regardless of ownership.

# ‍Storage of State

‍Solana programs, being read-only executable files, must store state using “Program Derived Addresses” (PDAs). PDAs are special types of accounts associated with and owned by a program rather than a specific user. While normal Solana user addresses are derived from the public key of an Ed25519 key pair, PDAs do not have a private key. Instead, their public key is derived from a combination of parameters—often keywords or other account addresses—along with the program ID (address) of the owning program.

‍PDA addresses exist ""off-curve,"" meaning they are not on the Ed25519 curve like normal addresses. Only the program that owns the PDA can programmatically generate signatures for it, ensuring that it’s the only one that can modify the PDA's state.

https://preview.redd.it/82dag167qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5e5694b996bf17c3928282a7cf37dfb104b75e

Above: Solana token accounts are specific examples of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). They are used to hold tokens and live “off-curve.” The Associated Token Account (ATA) program ensures that each wallet can only have one associated token account for each token type, providing a standardized way to manage token accounts.

# ‍Turbine

*“The most interesting part about Solana is not parallelization, the SVM, or Toly's tweets. It is something you probably haven't heard of: Turbine.” — Mert Mumtaz, Helius*

During the banking stage, transactions are organized into entries and sent to the Proof of History stream for timestamping. The block's bank is updated, and the entries are now ready for the next phase—Turbine.

Turbine is the process through which the leader propagates their block to the rest of the network. Inspired by [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), it is designed to be fast and efficient, reducing communication overhead and minimizing the amount of data a leader needs to send.

https://preview.redd.it/t9ijgbvaqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c0ee8a717f6c145ad661e1855ec49a38917e9f

Turbine achieves this by breaking down transaction data into ""shreds'' through a process called ""shredding."" Shreds are small packets of data, up to 1280 bytes, similar to individual frames in a video stream. When reassembled, these shreds allow validators to replay the entire block. The shreds are sent over the internet between validators using UDP and utilize erasure coding to handle packet loss or malicious dropping of packets. [Erasure coding](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/reedsolomon/reed_solomon_codes.html#), a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)\-based error detection and correction scheme, ensures data integrity. Even if some shreds are lost, the block can still be reconstructed.

Shreds are grouped into batches known as forward error correction (FEC) batches. By default, these batches consist of 64 shreds (32 data shreds + 32 recovery shreds). Data recovery occurs per FEC batch, meaning that up to half the packets in a batch can be lost or corrupted, and all the data can still be recovered. Each 64 shred batch is merkelized with the root being signed by the leader, and chained to the previous batch. This process ensures that shreds can be securely obtained from any node in the network that possesses them, as the chain of Merkle roots provides a verifiable path of authenticity and integrity.

The leader initially broadcasts to a single root node, which disseminates the shreds to all other validator nodes. This root node changes with each shred. Validators are organized into layers, forming the ""Turbine Tree."" Validators with a larger stake amount are typically positioned toward the top of the tree, while those with lower stakes are placed toward the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/3mflwjhcqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50409eac7cb3e07884ed130f632c95b3590541ba

The tree usually spans two or three hops, depending on the number of active validators. For visual simplicity, a fanout of 3 is depicted above, but Solana’s actual fanout value is currently set to 200. For security reasons, the order of the tree is rotated for each new batch of shreds.

The primary goal of such a system is to alleviate the outbound data egress pressure on the leader and root nodes. By utilizing a system of transmit and retransmit, the load is distributed between the leader and the retransmitters, reducing the strain on any single node.

# Consensus

*“Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana… I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive” — Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder*

Once a validator receives a new block from the leader via Turbine, it must validate all transactions within each entry. This involves replaying the entire block, validating the PoH hashes in parallel, recreating the transactions in the sequence dictated by PoH, and updating its local bank. 

[**https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png**](https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png)

This process is handled by the Transaction Validation Unit (TVU), which is analogous to the leader’s Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), serving as the core logic responsible for processing shreds and block validation. Like the TPU, the TVU flow is broken down into several stages, starting with the Shred Fetch Stage where shreds are received over Turbine. In the subsequent Shred Verify Leader Signature Stage, the shreds undergo multiple sanity checks, most notably the verification of the leader’s signature, which ensures that the received shreds originated from the leader. 

‍In the Retransmit Stage, the validator, based on its location in the Turbine tree, forwards the shreds to the appropriate downstream validators. In the Replay Stage, the validator recreates each transaction exactly and in the correct order while updating its local version of the bank.

‍The Replay Stage is analogous to the banking stage in the TPU; it is the most important stage and can be more directly described as the block validation stage. Replay is a single-threaded process loop that orchestrates many key operations, including voting, resetting the PoH clock, and switching banks.

When you ignore life’s alarms, it will only make them louder until you wake up. I am awake now. But I will sleep well tonight! Thank you all!

I’m not asking for help I just want to share my story.

I’m a hardworking mother of two, juggling work, studies, and life, doing everything I can to make it all work. Like many, I came to crypto with a dream- a dream of making good money to give my kids the childhood I never had.
But instead, I lost it all. I got rugged multiple times, poured countless sleepless nights into communities, and chased the promise of a better life. Looking back, I realize that chasing that dream cost me the very life I was trying to build for my kids. If I could go back, I’d put everything I had into paying off my loan and living a simple, carefree life.

Now, I’m back to where I started - living paycheck to paycheck and facing the reality of paying off that loan for the next ten years. Memecoins didn’t just take my money, they took time - time I can never get back with my family. All I can do now is hug my kids and leave this nightmare behind.

I did my own research, but it came at a heavy price.

For example, users who ask if the project is operating in accordance with the law on Save's discord will be met with vague answers, and then ridiculed, before being 'muted' or banned. 

The first step in obtaining justice for the victims of Save is filing criminal complaints against the founder of Rooter, so that he can be criminally charged. Rooter is not only a criminal but also a coward and refuses to identify himself. 

Save fails to pay taxes in any jurisdiction and therefore its crimes must also be brought to the attention of the IRS and CRA. However, since Rooter conceals the address of Save, there is no way to serve them legal notice.

The Solana Winternitz Vault is optional, meaning Solana users will need to choose to store their funds in the Winternitz vaults to be quantum-proof.

https://preview.redd.it/gg4ex0nst6be1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=efdc8a8977741b523d8e242268c43b4713cabf38

Solana developers have created a quantum-resistant vault on the Solana blockchain to protect user funds from potential threats posed by quantum computers.

The “Solana Winternitz Vault” solution achieves this by implementing a complex hash-based signature system that generates new keys every time a transaction is made, [explained ](https://github.com/deanmlittle/solana-winternitz-vault)cryptography researcher and Zeus Network chief scientist Dean Little in a Jan. 3 GitHub post.

Generating new private keys for each transaction should make it more difficult for [quantum computers](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-vs-quantum-computing-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-cryptocurrencies) to plan a coordinated attack on any given set of public keys, which are exposed each time a transaction is signed.

https://preview.redd.it/cypqygput6be1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=8494999794a376244bd5342448274b18424a518f

*Source:* [*Dean Little*](https://x.com/deanmlittle/status/1875136565456109891)

The Solana quantum-resistant feature is currently available as an optional addition, not a network-wide security upgrade. This means that Solana users must choose to store their funds in the Winternitz vaults, rather than their regular Solana wallets, to ensure their assets are protected against potential [quantum threats.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zero-knowledge-proofs-quantum-proof-ethereum-xin-xin-fan)

# How it works

The Winternitz vault first generates a new Winternitz keypair and computes the Keccak256 Merkle root of the public key.

A “split” vault consisting of a split and refund account is then created, where the user generates a Winternitz signature over a message containing the amount of “lamports” — the smallest denomination of the native cryptocurrency Solana — that they want to transfer.

Once the transfer is completed, any remaining funds are transferred to the refund account and the vault is closed.

***Related:*** [***Don't be afraid of quantum computers***](https://cointelegraph.com/news/i-m-not-afraid-of-quantum-computers)

The development could offer a degree of reassurance to many crypto investors who fear their cryptographically secured funds could one day be wiped out by an overpowering quantum computer.

Little seemingly poked fun at Bitcoin investor and commentator Fred Krueger, by sharing [screenshots](https://x.com/deanmlittle/status/1875252002160308634) from a Dec. 19 X post in which Krueger said Solana would be the “first casualty” of quantum.

Part of [Ethereum’s technical roadmap](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-the-splurge-advanced-cryptography-plan-for-quantum-computers) includes implementing quantum-resistant solutions — however, one of Ethereum’s founders, Vitalik Buterin, is confident that quantum won’t [pose any real threat](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-bitcoin-encryption-keys) for at least a decade.

“Even if ‘real’ quantum computers come soon, the day when regular people have quantum computers on their laptops or phones may well be decades after the day when powerful institutions get one that can crack elliptic curve cryptography,” Buterin said in October.

Reddit,solana,Telegram Hack [Awareness Post],2025-01-04 21:05:51,"I'm writing this to give awareness on how my Solana telegram account was hacked.

It all started from one of my token from GMGN (same applies to Dexscreener). As I review the graph as I usually do, I decided to visit again its X account to check for any news. Unfortunately, the X link has been changed to a malicious X account and I did not notice this. On the malicious X account was a post that news and discussion about the project will be discussed on the telegram group so I joined the tg group as I normally would.

During the joining process, there's the usual verify if your human popup from Safeguard to prevent bots from joining. I clicked this and everything looks normal, except for an extra step that I have to scan a QR code. I don't recall doing this with other tg group but it seems like a normal 2FA checking so I scanned it. And that's where I fucked up.

At first, nothing is happening, it only looks like the QR that i'm scanning is not working, so I kept on scanning it and trying to align the camera and lighting to get it right. Then I noticed something on my active chats, my Solana Trojan Bot, which I haven't used in a long time had a chat notification. I checked the message and it sent me my private key. I was wondering why, and read that the message requesting it came from me just seconds ago.

Right it that moment, I realized what happened and I triggered a logout on all devices from the tg app on my phone. Then a ""Token-Admin"" started chatting me, saying they can see that I that I'm having some problems joining the group. I blocked this person, and another one sent me a message. Told them to fuck off and they stopped, and left all tg groups.

I was lucky that my solana tg trading bot doesn't have any funds as I stopped using it long ago. So I removed it from the wallets, and moved all other funds to new wallets, just to be sure.

Posting this to share awareness that it's so easy to get hacked nowadays. You could be doing something you normally do multiple times a day, and still get hacked. Always double check everything on every step, and for the love of god, don't scan any QR code on telegram.

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept 3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

Reddit,ethereum,"""Vitalik Buterin Deserves a Nobel Prize in Economics for His Work on Crypto and Ethereum."": Bankless Co-Founder Ryan Sean Adams",2025-01-03 14:32:32,"In a tweet Ryan Sean Adams - co-founder of Bankless - said that Vitalik Buterin should be recognized with a Nobel prize in economics for his contributions to Ethereum and the entire crypto space. He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

I wonder if one day Vitalik will be remembered as one of the greatest economic innovators of our time",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

Please ask any questions you may have!  We have our next public goods funding round beginning January 11th.  To learn more about Octant, join our discord: [https://discord.com/invite/octant](https://discord.com/invite/octant) ",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,ethereum,How to Start Research on Ethereum as a Beginner?,2025-01-01 14:03:35,"I’m a developer, just getting into this space. While I’ve worked on development, I’ve never done formal research in crypto before. I want to expand my knowledge and better understand the ecosystem from a research perspective.

Could you share some advice or resources for someone with development experience to get started with crypto research? I’m particularly interested in:

* Researching Ethereum protocols, scalability solutions, or DeFi.
* Understanding key academic or technical papers in this field.
* Tools, frameworks, or platforms commonly used in crypto research.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
Reddit,ethereum,"Transfer went wrong, please help me",2025-01-02 10:32:35,"I did 2 money transfers from Gatehub wallet to Revolut wallet. Regarding BTC, I pushed « receive » on Revolut and it gave me a BTC wallet address, which I copy pasted after pushing « transfer BTC » on Gatehub.

I did the exact same thing for Eth.

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

I am no crypto expert, can anyone here help me  find my money ?

Ps : wrote to revolut, they said they don’t know where is the money, and that they are looking

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

Please help

EDIT : Turns out Gatehub sent BTC and ETH on XRP network which is not managed by Revolut. But they still found a way to recover the funds !! So money is safe for now 🤙🏼

Thank you to all the people who tried to help. 🙏🏻

Cheers to all the scammers who tried to make me log my wallets into your dark web apps. 🙋🏻‍♂️",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,ethereum,What's the most economic way to swap rETH(on mainnet) to USCD(on Arbitrum)?,2024-12-31 22:13:58,"Please let me know if there's a better way to maximize my funds.  I only want to be using DEX.

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Thanks for your input!

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

I’m just getting started with learning about smart contracts, and honestly, I’m pretty excited (and a little overwhelmed). Ethereum has always fascinated me, and I finally decided it’s time to stop just reading about it and actually start building something.

I’ve been messing around with Solidity and doing some tutorials to get a feel for how everything works. My goal is to eventually create my own project—something small and manageable for now, but hopefully useful or at least a good learning experience.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,ethereum,Those living in Canada: Do you save up in USDC?,2024-12-28 18:33:37,"Hi!

With the decline of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, are you considering creating your emergency fund in USD?
For sure, you can open an USD account in a traditional bank but do you also consider buying USDC (or other tokens)?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to have a discussion regarding **how relevant (or nor) is it to save up in USDC for a Canadian.** I know a lot of Canadians are already investing in USD anyway.
**Does saving up directly on a USD stablecoin make any sense?**


How I see it:

**Advantages**
- less fees (maybe not, I really don't know what are the fees for a USD account opened in Canada)
- easy to buy 

**Disadvantages**
- **taxes implications?** If you pay your transaction fees in ETH, technically you may have to pay taxes on it (depending on your ACB). Plus, since ERC-20 tokens are considered assets in Canada, you should pay taxes if you make a gain when you spend your USDC (*if USD(C)/CAD goes up in value across time, which is the current consensus*)
- **not easy to spend USD** outside of Crypto space (but crypto cards are democratizing)",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to run a state only node ?,2024-12-28 12:11:33,"Hey,

I'm not really sure how different Ethereum is from Bitcoin in client logic. From my understanding, there are transactions and state (smart contract values, etc...).

In my case, I need to access the read-only features of some smart contracts without spending too much on hardware. 

My current solution was to use an rpc provider, request the state of contract x, then listen for new blocks and update the state on my end based on the transactions received. This is necessary to avoid hitting rate limits, as my usage uses a large number of requests.

The problem is that the ""sync"" part can take days with the current rate limit because I'm using contract calls, which probably isn't the best solution. So I wanted to know if it was possible to run a node without the whole blockchain, just with the state, the goal is not to verify transactions but to know more efficiently the state of specific contracts.

Do you know if this is possible? if not, is it difficult to create my own implementation to request this directly on the network like real nodes do, and include my logic instead?

A kind of ethereum client that  sync only a specific part of the state and does not store or verify transactions",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
Reddit,ethereum,Can somebody explain how people are still paying $23 or over that for gas fees in the second half of 2024?,2024-12-27 17:18:42,"Hi. I was just following an ETH thread in the cryptocurrency subreddit and various people are claiming they are paying about $30 or even more than that for their gas fees for L1 transactions.

For example, [I saw this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hm4k11/comment/m3tigd0/
):

> Yeah I try to swap $45 worth of ETH for a coin I want and it's costing me $23 gas fees. No thanks. 

I have read other comments in the past few weeks of people still paying something like upper $20 range for gas fees, and I assume their transactions were recently?

How is this possible though?  Checking the gas fee chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#1y, the highest average gas fee in the last 6 months was $14 USD on November 13th.  The gas fee has generally been lower than that in the last 6 months for Ethereum.

I haven't seen any average gas fee over $20 USD since March of 2024 according to that chart.  So how are people still paying like $23, or even in the upper $20 range for their gas fees lately?",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,ethereum,Beginner confused about networks,2024-12-26 11:16:47,"Hi all, 

I’m fairly new to crypto and find the networks quite overwhelming. 

I can choose from Ethereum (ERC20), Optimism, Arbitrum One, or Base network. 

Unfortunately I do not know the difference between these - all I know, is I don’t want to pay the exorbitant fees from the ERC20 network. 

Can I just randomly choose the same low fee network on my sending and receiving end, or is there a process to using other networks, e.g., buying supporting coins for a transaction? 

I also noticed the differing networks have their own amount of eth storage. If you send eth using a specific network, it’ll stay on that network forever? You can never combine all your eth? 

Are there any negatives of using different networks to avoid exorbitant fees?

As you can see, I’m quite confused, any help would be much appreciated!!

Reddit,ethereum,Can anyone explain step by step how one would set limit sell orders of ETH for USDC/USDT/DAI on a DEX?,2024-12-24 20:56:14,"I have my ETH on a Ledger wallet.  I want to set limit sell orders to convert to a stable coin.  How does one do that?  

From the basic research I did on 1Inch, it seems to only work with WETH?  So, do I have to convert my ETH into WETH first to do this?  Is that right?  What are things one should know before setting limit transactions?  Are they considerably more expensive than regular swaps or transactions?  Are there any inherant risks involved?  What does it cost to change or cancel them later?",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

""Blackrock is manipulating the price.""

""Blackrock is shorting to drive the price down to make you panic sell so they can buy it cheap.""

That's not how it works.

Blackrock offers an ETF to their customers. They make money by charging a fee to the ETF customers. 

They are not a whale swing trading to try to drive price movement. If anything, I would argue it is in their interest to see the price of Bitcoin go up, because that would drive more people to buy and hold their ETF.

So, please STFU with your Blackrock Bitcoin tinfoil hat nonsense.

For me it was realizing that money as a medium of exchange flows to the hardest asset or the asset with the most salability (stock to flow ratio). So when I looked up the market cap of gold (considered the worldwide standard for hardest asset) and saw that it's $18T and did the math on the 20M coins in circulation. I realized that the eventual long-term equilibrium price of the market cap of Bitcoin will have to settle to at least this price of $18T whether any individual or government likes it or not. Even if they try to fight it, it's a huge uphill battle. This would put the eventual price of Bitcoin at $900,000 per coin when it reaches equilibrium.

I purchased bitcoin on MoonPay. It was supposed to direct to a specific wallet, instead
I assume it started a new wallet? When I look in MoonPay, I see currency there.  I have the email with the wallet it was deposited to. I can click on that wallet and it displays on the blockchair website.  

My problem is…. MoonPay won’t let me sell. It just says “Coming Soon to Your Region”. 

I realize I screwed up. By not learning enough about bitcoin. I did not set up the bitcoin wallet. I took at face value that MoonPay was setting it up and I was going to be able to transfer the funds as needed to make the payment I’m trying to make.  

I now have $90 usd sitting in MoonPay and no way to use it…. At all….

So my question…. As I have the wallet number, is there a way to access that wallet from a different app? Or is that money gone as long as MoonPay won’t let me sell it? 

Please help me understand, or point me in the right direction to help figure this out.

*Changelly is a crypto exchange which boasts about having millions of users using it to exchange cryptocurrency tokens. However, in recent years they have been involved in what is known as a selective scam.*

**How the scam operates?**  
*Users will exchange crypto tokens with Changelly if the amount is low it will go smoothly if it reaches $300 + then they will decide to scam you or to wait for you to deposit a bigger amount and then strike.*

*Once Changelly has identified they want to scam you they will initiate a AML/KYC compliance check. The purpose of this check is some people out of fear of there identity being stolen wont do a KYC check and in that case Changelly will steal your money instead of handing it over to law enforcement agencies.*

*If the user does comply and submit KYC verification they will then be asked a series of questions such as prove that you own the funds, prove that you own the address and provide evidence. Unlike in my case where I was able to prove everything the way this series in the scam works is Changelly knows a lot of early Bitcoin users bought there crypto from localbitcoins or other P2P ways and will have no way of proving they own the funds. Again, Changelly will refuse to hand the money to law enforcement agencies and instead keep them.*

*The final phase of the scam is when you have successfuly submitted everything and Changelly has no where to run they will then ignore your e-mails and give you automated replies if you call them out publically and block you.*

**YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK!**

**Lawyers?**  
*You might be thinking why not get lawyers involved? Changelly very smartly discreets its correct location it can be Estonia, Czech Republic, St Vincent and Grenadines or Hong Kong and to file a case against them will cost you around $2,000 which is a way to trap you because if they refund you after the first letter from the lawyer then you have your money back but lost the fees, in other instances the fees will be more than the amount.*

Reddit,bitcoin,Holding Period for Crypto Tax Exemption in Germany – Need Help Understanding the Rules,2025-01-08 12:14:23,"Hi everyone,

I’m trying to get a clear understanding of how the holding period for cryptocurrency works for tax exemption in Germany.

From what I’ve read, **§ 23 EStG** states that if you hold crypto for more than a year, any gains from selling it are tax-exempt. However, I’m unsure whether the one-year holding period starts from when you become a **tax resident in Germany**, or if it includes the time you held the crypto before moving here.

Specifically, I’d like to know:

* If I’ve been holding crypto before moving to Germany, does the one-year holding period for tax exemption start from the date I became a tax resident in Germany, or does it take into account the period I held the crypto in my previous country of residence?
* Is there any official source, ruling, or legal reference that confirms how the holding period is calculated for crypto under these circumstances?

I’d really appreciate any insights or references to official guidelines. Thanks a lot!",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why do people keep leveraging crypto just to be liquidated?,2025-01-08 20:39:02,"Seriously, I can’t wrap my head around this. Every time the market crashes, we see the same story: millions (sometimes billions) of dollars in leveraged positions wiped out in a matter of hours. It’s like a ritual at this point. But why do so many people keep doing it?

I get it—leverage sounds appealing. You think, “If I’m confident that Bitcoin is going up, why not amplify my gains with a 10x long?” On paper, it makes perfect sense. Why settle for a 5% move when you can make 50%? But the thing is, markets don’t move the way you want them to. Even in a clear bull run, there are wild pullbacks and unexpected wicks that liquidate leveraged positions in seconds.

And that’s the core problem: leverage amplifies both your gains and your losses. Most people don’t realize that when you leverage 10x, it only takes a 10% move in the wrong direction for you to lose everything. In crypto, where 10% swings can happen in an hour, you’re basically playing with fire.

What’s crazy to me is how predictable this has become. Every major price drop is accompanied by massive liquidation events. Exchanges rake in fees, whales manipulate prices to trigger liquidations, and retail traders end up losing their stacks. It’s like a game of “who gets wrecked first,” and the answer is almost always the guy using too much leverage.

But why don’t people learn? Is it greed? Ignorance? Overconfidence? I think it’s a mix of all three. Greed makes you want bigger gains. Ignorance makes you underestimate the risks. And overconfidence makes you think you’re smarter than the market. Add in influencers hyping up “easy” gains with leverage and exchanges pushing high-leverage options, and it’s no wonder so many people get sucked in.

Here’s the thing: you don’t need leverage to make life-changing money in crypto. The market is volatile enough that even a simple 1x position can lead to massive gains if you time it right. And if you don’t time it right, at least you won’t get wiped out by a single bad move.

I’m not saying leverage has no place. Professional traders with strict risk management can use it effectively. But for 99% of people, it’s a recipe for disaster. If you’re leveraging without fully understanding the risks or without proper stop-losses, you’re basically gambling.

So, why do you think people keep doing this? Is it just the allure of quick riches? The thrill of high-stakes trading? Or is it a lack of education about how leverage actually works?

Let me know your thoughts. I feel like this is a conversation we need to have more often because too many people are losing their hard-earned money for no good reason.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why does the crypto market respond so violently to even the smallest bit of bad news?,2025-01-08 03:21:21,"The cryptocurrency market has become increasingly volatile, and this volatility often feels exaggerated compared to the actual significance of the news that triggers it. If there’s good news, prices might go up a little, but even the slightest hint of bad news seems to lead to tremendous dumps. This behavior raises questions about the motivations of market participants. Is this volatility a result of people anticipating that others will panic-sell? Are they preemptively taking profits while prices are still relatively high, intending to buy back in when the price inevitably drops lower? Or do these traders genuinely believe that the negative news warrants a reduced valuation for their assets?

It’s hard to figure out the true mindset behind these actions, especially when the news causing the market to drop often seems insignificant. For example, minor regulatory updates, rumors of market instability, or even unrelated macroeconomic events can cause massive sell-offs. This suggests that many participants are not reacting to the intrinsic value of their holdings but rather trying to outgame one another. Traders might not actually believe the news justifies a lower valuation but instead act as if it does because they think others will sell. By selling first, they aim to avoid losses and position themselves to buy back in at a lower price. This cycle perpetuates the volatility, as it’s driven more by psychological factors and herd behavior than fundamental analysis.

Another issue is that this kind of behavior creates a feedback loop. When traders dump at the first sign of trouble, it validates the fears of others who might have been on the fence about selling. This can lead to cascading sell-offs, where even those with long-term investment strategies feel compelled to exit their positions temporarily, fearing further losses. On the flip side, positive news doesn’t seem to have the same explosive impact, as gains tend to be more gradual and cautious. ",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I've registered to bluesky to check the crypto community there and I found: Nothing,2025-01-08 15:10:36,"Hi everyone! I'd like to discuss the current state of Crypto and it's relation to the temporary political landscape. Because I'm concerned of the fact, that Crypto seems to generally evolve into a right wing thing, with the very prominent Trump/Musk movements at the front.

My headline statement is not entirely true. Because I found crypto to be discussed on bluesky, but only (!) the shady perspectives, how it is ""all a scam"", and how especially the MAGAs pushing it, so it provokes a generally rejecting sentiment within bluesky's liberal oriented userbase.

I think it's concerning how crypto evolves into a political tool supported by the one side while rejected by the other, as I feel totally not attached to and represented by right wing (while having strong issues with the liberal side of things as well honestly), and I hope the concept of decentralised finance will come out as more universal than that, just because of it's disrupting features beyond all political belief systems. 

How do you guys see it? Will crypto come out to be owned by the reds? And what can be done to prevent that?",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

So, as the title suggests. What is the legality of using using a CEX on a VPN that has recently become banned in my home country?



More specifically, will this be flagged when I do my taxes, and subsequently, will the profit not be considered legal?



I am looking to take profit on a token so would like some advise here. I entered a pre-sale and it isn't trading on many other CEXs.



Does the liability fall on the exchange in this situation, or can the user be penalised when they go to cash-out and file their taxes?

On the **DEX side**, **XLM (Stellar)** led with an impressive **271.9% surge**, while **UNI (Uniswap)** and **SUSHI (SushiSwap)** followed with **124.8%** and **54.7%** gains.

Overall, **CEX tokens outperformed DEX tokens** in 2024, showcasing stronger resilience and more User-friendliness, people still prefer and trust CEXs more than Dexs.

# The 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment Has Begun!

For the [**eighth year in a row**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/), I am happy to announce the launch of the Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment for 2025.  

For those unfamiliar with the Experiments, my annual tradition is to buy $100 of each of the Top Ten Cryptos every New Year’s Day since [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

***The Top Ten Experiments have now purchased a total of $8,000 in crypto since January 2018.***

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio includes the following cryptos, in descending order as per [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) on January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/zex7wo5cclbe1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=4818de85bafc0aff776f36ff8f3df0ee075989de

**That’s a $1000 investment on the 1st of January, 2025**, ($100 each) of #1 **BTC**, #2 **ETH**, #3 **XRP**, #5 **BNB**, #6 **SOL**, #7 **DOGE**, #8 **USDC**, #9 **ADA**, #10 **TRON**, and #11 **AVAX**.

Fun fact #1: *For the second year in a row, all 2025 coins have appeared in at least one past Top Ten Portfolio, meaning no new cryptocurrencies have joined the overall Experiment.* 

Long time Top Ten Experiment followers will notice **I’m again breaking the tradition of strictly investing in the Top Ten by market cap, no matter what.**  To stay consistent with past Experiments, I will only include one stablecoin, so #11 **AVAX** is in and #7 **USDT** is out.  I made a similar decision with the [**2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/), [**2023**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/), and [**2024 Top Ten Portfolios**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/).  

**USDC** will remain in the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio. 

So: ***The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio = Top Ten – USDT + #11 AVAX.***

Q: *Why keep a stablecoin in the portfolio at all?* 

A: Consistency.  For better or worse, I included **USDT** in the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) and one stable in every subsequent year since.  Including a stablecoin in the 2025 Top Ten is my attempt at an honest/fair comparison between each year’s portfolios.

Q: *Why were stablecoins included in the Top Ten Experiments in the first place?*  

A:  Check out the [FAQs](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/).

# Where Did You Purchase The 2025 Top Ten Crypto?

Thanks to the good work they’re doing over at [Universal](https://app.universalassets.xyz/), I barely had to leave Base this year. Details/proof of purchases below:

I used [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/) on Base for **WBTC (ahem, cbBTC)** and **WETH:**

https://preview.redd.it/ab5jmxwdclbe1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ac0ddeb2da38815e1562751ad674fb604db117

[DefiLlama](https://swap.defillama.com/) on Base for the Universal assets **uSOL, uDOGE, uADA,** and **uXRP.**

https://preview.redd.it/wv10e4jlclbe1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=43e9f1db2600d73370d7f0bb7947a6c5975388c3

Over to BNB Smart Chain’s [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) for **BNB** and **TRON**

And finally, I used [DefiLlama](https://swap.defillama.com/) to purchase **AVAX** on Avalanche :

Fun fact #2: *For the first time in Experiment history, I purchased 100% of the Top Ten on Decentralized Exchanges*

# My Homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Fund VS Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an *attempt to capture the gains of the entire cryptocurrency market.*  

No crypto indexes existed, so I created my own.

Crypto has rapidly progressed in recent years and now more and more options exist.

This year I’ll be comparing my homemade Top Ten Index to [Coinbase’s COIN50](https://www.coinbase.com/coin50), Coinbase’s benchmark crypto index, which offers “diversified exposure to 50 leading digital assets.”  Here’s the snapshot of what COIN50 was worth on 1 January 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/lpxn0y2wclbe1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=264120ef3c9e74a0ae217fc463236474e9e6e690

**Here’s the question I’ll be tracking:** as the year goes by, ***will COIN50 outperform my homemade Top Ten Index Fund?*** 

# All Systems Go!

Like every year, I’m excited to launch the latest iteration of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. If you’re new to the Experiments, welcome! If you’ve been following over the years, many thanks for sticking around. 

The first monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio will drop in early February.  Other reports from the 2018-2024 Top Ten Portfolios will be released periodically over the course of the year.

In the meantime, you’re welcome to pour through years of data [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

Happy New Year and here’s hoping for an up only 2025 (insert rocket emoji here).

I made a post the other day asking why so few people are paying attention to OriginTrail (Trac) token. You can find the post[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hv9kzx/why_arent_people_investing_in_origintrail_trac/).

They released their newest iteration of the DKG just 2 weeks ago and the Trac demand doubled instantly and has slowly been increasing since. Today, 80,000 Trac tokens went as payment to nodes.

Currently, this project, at this price, is heavily undervalued. Why? The nodes and people staking on these nodes are making over 20%+ yearly return, and it just keeps going up. Mainly due to low number of nodes (71 active nodes) and increasing demand coming 100% from businesses interacting with the DKG.

Yes, I've personally started to load up last week as I was reasonably familiar with the project since I first got introduced to it in 2021. It's time to load up here.

You can downvote me, I don't care. Just giving heads up to whoever is interested as this crypto ocean still has poop floating at the very top.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Courtyard's & Polygon's auction of a 1999 PSA 10 Charizard Pokemon card is at $260K with 2 days remaining,2025-01-07 19:49:34,"About a month ago at Art Basel, Polygon announced they had acquired a PSA 10 1st Edition Shadowless Charizard card and are auctioning it on Courtyard. 

For those who haven't heard of Courtyard, Courtyard is an RWA project.  It is a pioneering platform that integrates blockchain technology with the world of physical collectibles, particularly focusing on trading cards like those from Pokémon, sports, and other collectible categories. 

Courtyard allows users to tokenize their physical collectibles, mainly graded trading cards, into NFTs on Polygon. Users send their card to Courtyard. All physical items are stored in secure vaults provided by Brink's, ensuring that the collectibles are safe, insured, and can be redeemed at any time. Courtyard hosts a marketplace where users can buy, sell, or trade these tokenized collectibles. They also run auctions, including no-reserve auctions, where items like a PSA 10 Charizard card can be bid on. These auctions leverage the Polygon blockchain for transparency and efficiency. 

Polygon had initially acquired this card for $250,000. This is the most valuable Pokemon card - one sold for $369,000 back in 2020, and another for $420,000 in 2022. 

I may be wrong, but this may be the highest RWA auction for a collectible so far in web3.  If this is a sign of things to come in 2025, there's a lot of liquidity that is out there!

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,Hashing conundrums,2024-12-20 20:49:23,"I have two questions about hashing that I thought might as well be merged into one post.

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

I wanted to reach out and apologize for removing my recent post about AMBER256. Upon reflection, I realized that I currently lack the necessary expertise to develop a robust cryptographic algorithm. My intention was never to spread an unsound or insecure algorithm, and I believe it's important to prevent the dissemination of potentially flawed cryptographic methods.

Before I revisit this project, I plan to dedicate significant time to studying existing implementations and understanding possible attacks. My goal is to ensure that any future contributions I make are both meaningful and secure.

I am sincerely sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. I also want to thank everyone who offered support and constructive feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your understanding.

Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to engaging with the community again once I have gained more knowledge in this field.",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996
Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21).

And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-09 00:53:04.749996

To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, *maybe, eventually,* someone will need to *start thinking about* migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack.

Given SHA256 is supposed to be random and well distributed, is it true to say that essentially each output can have an infinite and relatively equal number of collisions generated by infinite inputs.

i.e. given in reality we have infinite inputs to feed the function (think arbitrary long binary numbers), can we assume that a properly functioning hash function has ""even and reachable"" collisions across it's output space?
