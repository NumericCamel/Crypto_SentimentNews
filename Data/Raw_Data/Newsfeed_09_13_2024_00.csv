Among the most discussed potential breakout tokens are Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both cryptocurrencies have attracted the attention of analysts and investors alike, who predict that these assets could see gains upwards of 300% in the near future. With Internet Computer (ICP) showcasing renewed strength and Mpeppe gaining traction as a high-potential meme coin, the two tokens are positioned for impressive growth. In this article, we’ll dive into why these two cryptos could be poised for massive rallies, and why now might be the time to jump in before the next wave of gains. Why Internet Computer (ICP) is Attracting Investor Attention Internet Computer (ICP) has been steadily gaining momentum in 2024. After experiencing a series of dips in the latter half of 2023, Internet Computer (ICP) began to regain its footing, surging over 12% in the past seven days. With its current price standing at around $8.5, Internet Computer (ICP) has shown resilience, particularly when compared to other Layer-1 blockchain projects. The anticipation for a breakout above the $10 mark is growing, with analysts setting their sights on $11—the resistance level the token struggled to break past in July. One of the reasons for Internet Computer’s (ICP) growing momentum is the increasing use cases and applications built on its blockchain. As one of the most scalable and decentralized Layer-1 blockchains, Internet Computer (ICP) is designed to enhance the speed, security, and efficiency of decentralized applications (dApps). This has attracted a growing number of developers and users to the ecosystem, contributing to the positive price action in recent weeks. Moreover, the recent spike in trading volume suggests that the bulls may be gearing up for a major push. ICP’s technical indicators, including the Money Flow Index (MFI) and MACD, are flashing bullish signals, further solidifying predictions of a potential 300% rally. The key levels to watch are the $9 resistance and the $10 psychological barrier, both of which could spark a sharp upward move once breached. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) Meme Coin Phenomenon While Internet Computer (ICP) represents the more established side of the crypto world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its own niche as a fast-rising meme coin with serious upside potential. Since its introduction to the market, Mpeppe has quickly gained popularity among meme coin enthusiasts and early adopters, with many investors comparing it to the likes of Shiba Inu and PepeCoin. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly interesting is its ability to tap into the meme culture while offering a community-driven project with strong growth potential. The token’s current price sits at $0.0021, and experts predict that it could easily surge past $0.01 once it is fully listed on major exchanges and completes the final stages of its presale. With 80% of its presale already completed, the excitement surrounding Mpeppe is palpable. As more investors pile in, the token’s low entry price and high upside potential make it a prime target for those looking to secure early gains. Some analysts have even suggested that Mpeppe could follow in the footsteps of other successful meme coins and deliver 300% or more in returns within the next year. 3 Reasons Why Both Tokens Could Surge in 2024 Here are three key reasons why both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are likely to see significant rallies in 2024: 1. Growing Developer Interest and Use Cases for ICP Internet Computer (ICP) continues to attract attention due to its ability to support scalable and efficient decentralized applications. As more projects choose Internet Computer (ICP) as their platform of choice, the increased network activity will drive demand for the token, pushing its price higher. With major updates and new partnerships on the horizon, the momentum is expected to carry forward into 2024. 2. Mpeppe’s Growing Community and Viral Appeal Mpeppe (MPEPE) benefits from its strong meme coin appeal and growing community support. In the world of meme coins, a dedicated community is often the key driver of price appreciation. As Mpeppe nears the completion of its presale and prepares for exchange listings, the viral nature of the project could propel it to new heights, delivering massive returns for early investors. 3. Whale Activity and Bullish Technical Indicators Whale activity has been increasing for both tokens. Large investors have been steadily accumulating Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe, which often signals that a big price move is on the horizon. Additionally, bullish technical indicators such as the MACD crossover for Internet Computer (ICP) and the rising social sentiment for Mpeppe suggest that both assets are poised for strong upward momentum. Conclusion: Is Now the Time to Invest? As we move through the final months of 2024, both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling opportunities for investors. ICP is gaining traction thanks to its robust blockchain ecosystem and improving technical indicators, while Mpeppe is drawing attention as a potential breakout meme coin with significant upside. For those looking to diversify their portfolios with a mix of established and emerging tokens, both ICP and Mpeppe should be on the radar. With the possibility of 300% gains on the horizon, now might be the perfect time to consider investing in these two exciting assets.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Which Altcoins Could Skyrocket Next? Analytics Firm Points To These,2024-09-13 00:00:27+00:00,"The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has pointed out how these three altcoins may be more likely to see price jumps in the coming future. These Altcoins Are Being Heavily Shorted On Binance Right Now In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed about some altcoins that could be worth keeping an eye on because of a trend forming in their Binance Funding Rate. The Funding Rate here refers to an indicator that tracks the periodic amount of fees that traders on a given derivatives exchange (in this case, Binance) are paying each other right now. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs Shiba Inu Vs Pepe: How Do The Top Memecoins Compare In Investor Profits? When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long investors are paying a fee to the short holders in order to keep their positions. Such a trend suggests the majority of the derivatives users share a bullish sentiment. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies the shorts are outweighing the longs, so a bearish mentality could be assumed to be the dominant one in the sector. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Binance Funding Rate for three altcoins, Aave (AAVE), The Graph (GRT), and Decentraland (MANA), over the past week: As is visible in the above graph, the Binance Funding Rate has recently switched from green to red for all three of these altcoins. This would suggest that the investors have opened a large amount of short positions on the exchange related to these assets, thus shifting the balance. Interestingly, this heavy shorting from the investors has come as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has been rebounding, led by Bitcoin’s recovery back above $58,000. It would appear that derivatives users don’t expect AAVE, GRT, and MANA to continue the bullish wave. This pessimism around the altcoins, however, can actually play into the benefit of their prices. This is because mass liquidation events are more likely to affect the side of the market with the most positions. At present, the dominant side is the bearish one, so mass short liquidations could likely occur in the coming days. Whenever a large amount of liquidations take place at once (an event that’s popularly known as a squeeze), the price can see a burst of volatility arising out of all this fuel. As such, Santiment believes that should these shorts get caught in a liquidation event, the altcoins could see big price jumps. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery: Has BTC Prevented A Fall To $41,000 With This Surge? It only remains to be seen, though, whether Aave and others would show price surges from here and punish these investors betting on a bearish outcome. Aave Price Aave has been enjoying bullish momentum during the last few days as its price has risen to $147 after witnessing a surge of over 11% in the last seven days.

Less than a year after transiting to the mainnet after months of testing, the platform is taking bold steps to scale the base layer and further boost data availability. Celestia Plans For 1 GB Blocks For Scaling In a recent announcement, the platform’s core developers said it was preparing for the next phase, which will see the blockchain introduce 1 GB blocks. The decision to unleash 1 GB blocks will be a major move to scale on-chain and push throughput even higher. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs Shiba Inu Vs Pepe: How Do The Top Memecoins Compare In Investor Profits? It will only make sense. Celestia uses a modular architecture that allows the network to scale. Unlike Ethereum, which is struggling to scale on-chain and heavily reliant on off-chain platforms like Base and StarkNet, Celestia remains scalable and flexible, circumventing challenges legacy networks encounter. With 1GB blocks and scaling increased, Celestia said developers would be free to build whatever they wish. Exemplifying progress made by modern chains, developers are not confined to deploying smart contracts using a single programming language like struggles to scale on-chain, which is Solidity or Rust. Instead, they can choose what they are comfortable with. To achieve the 1 GB blocks, Celestia plans to introduce innovations such as content-addressable mempools and compact blocks. Moreover, plans will be made to deploy internally sharding nodes and improve its data availability sampling protocol. TIA Down 80%, Will The Supply Uptick Fast-Track The Dump? Impressive as this could be, TIA, the native currency, has been on a free fall. Price data shows that bears have been in control after prices soared to as high as $21 in February, forcing the coin down by over 80%. At spot rates, the coin remains under intense selling pressure. If anything, sellers could unwind all progress made after listing on Binance in early November. Related Reading: XRP Price Stalls in Range: Will a Breakout Come Soon? The immediate concern is the upcoming token unlock set for October 30. Usually, token unlocks are considered bearish due to the expected spike in supply. Today, the platform will release 175 million TIA or 16.5% of the total supply. Afterward, a daily release of 1 million TIA will be from November 1. By next year, Token Unlocks, a monitoring platform, projects that TIA’s supply will be up by nearly 4X. If demand remains low, as is currently the case, prices could plunge below November 2023 lows due to the deluge in supply.

However, he also indicates that Bitcoin is poised to reach new all-time highs regardless of the election outcome, with an anticipated value of $75,000 if Vice President Kamala Harris secures the presidency. Elaborating on the election’s implications on the cryptocurrency landscape, Kendrick highlights that while the political scenario will undoubtedly influence the Bitcoin market, the perceived risks associated with a Harris presidency might be exaggerated.  Related Reading: Challenges Mount For Bitcoin Miners As Difficulty Surges To Record High According to Kendrick’s analysis, the Bitcoin price is projected to conclude 2024 at record highs under either election scenario, nearing the $125,000 threshold under a Trump victory or hovering around $75,000 in a Harris administration.  In the wake of a potential Harris win. However, an initial price dip could occur, Kendrick asserts that market participants would likely view such declines as buying opportunities, given the expectation of continued regulatory advancements. Contrary to industry apprehensions regarding Harris potentially adopting a stringent stance towards Bitcoin, Kendrick contends that her administration would likely exhibit a more favorable outlook towards digital assets than a potential second term under President Biden.  Moreover, Standard Chartered remains optimistic about the Bitcoin price future, maintaining a bullish stance by forecasting a surge to $200,000 by the conclusion of 2025, irrespective of the election outcome this year. Potential Q4 Rally For BTC Evaluating the current state of the Bitcoin market, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades shed light on BTC’s historical performance trends in September.  Despite the general observation that Bitcoin tends to face challenges in September, Daan assesses that whether at the beginning of a bullish trend, in the later stages of previous market cycles, or even in a bearish phase, September typically marks a local bottom followed by a subsequent up move in the fourth quarter. Recently, Bitcoin encountered two significant downturns, notably on August 5, when it dropped nearly 25%, causing the price to plummet to as low as $49,000.  Subsequently, another retracement occurred on September 6, pushing the price to $52,000. However, amidst these fluctuations, Bitcoin has shown resilience by trading at $58,360, indicating strong support along the macro uptrend line. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whales Pull Out $4 Million From Exchanges, Can SHIB Recover? Moreover, Daan Crypto Trades emphasizes that a considerable portion of BTC’s liquidity remains at higher levels. This observation aligns with the price effectively clearing out historical levels from approximately the past six months during the sharp decline witnessed in early August. Highlighting a pivotal level to monitor, the analyst underscores the significance of surpassing the $65,000 mark. Breaking this level would signify the formation of a local higher high, potentially paving the way towards targeting the liquidity at $70,000.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Crypto Analyst Says You Should Get In Right Now,2024-09-12 21:30:38+00:00,"A crypto analyst is mega bullish on the future outlook of the XRP price, predicting a massive price surge to $40 for cryptocurrency. Despite XRP’s stagnant price growth over the years, this crypto analyst remains confident in the cryptocurrency’s short-term and long-term prospects. XRP Surge Incoming, Don’t Panic Sell XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is currently showing incredibly bullish signals according to ‘Steph Is Crypto,’ a market expert on X (formerly Twitter). Sharing a video discussing his analysis of the XRP chart, Steph Is Crypto disclosed that cryptocurrency is gearing up for a substantial breakout in the immediate short term.  Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In A ‘Healthier’ Place Now, Here’s Why The analyst disclosed that XRP is currently shaping a “larger inverted head and shoulders” technical pattern. As a result, he predicted that a breakout would be confirmed in XRP when a daily candle was seen close to the neckline at the $0.65 level. Once XRP closes above this crucial price level, the cryptocurrency could witness a price increase to $1.11, representing a 106% surge from its current value.  Steph Is Crypto further revealed that on the monthly time frame, XRP’s price is getting closer to the apex of its distinctive symmetrical triangle pattern. A symmetrical triangle is a neutral chart formation consisting of two converging trend lines that suggest a potential price breakthrough after a period of sideways trading.  Based on XRP’s triangle chart pattern, the analyst believes that the cryptocurrency could experience a massive price surge to $40 in the next few weeks. Considering the ambitious nature of this price forecast, Steph Is Crypto has warned investors to take it with a grain of salt, noting the market’s unpredictable nature.  However, should XRP break above the downward-sloping resistance line on its symmetrical triangle pattern, the cryptocurrency could see a rapid move to the upside. A jump to $40 would mean that the XRP will require a 75.5% rally from its present price of $0.53.  Looking at the Fear and Greed index of the broader crypto market, the majority of investors are in a fearful state due to the recent market decline and volatility. However, Steph In Crypto has urged XRP investors to stay bullish, emphasizing that now is the worst time to panic sell their holdings.   He also revealed that XRP is witnessing a significant build-up of liquidity from short positions. As a result, he recommends that investors keep an eye out on the cryptocurrency’s liquidity margin, predicting a short squeeze or a move upwards soon.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Path To $60,000: Analyst Reveals Why $55,881 Is Important Update On XRP Price Analysis Despite XRP’s bullish forecast from analysts and its newfound legal clarity, the cryptocurrency continues to experience sluggish growth.

Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest This strong performance comes after the altcoin broke through the $18 resistance level, signaling bullish momentum. Investors and analysts are now eyeing higher prices for INJ, with some suggesting it could be poised for even more significant gains shortly. However, INJ must test key supply levels and establish support within critical demand zones for this uptrend to continue. The current optimism surrounding Injective is backed by encouraging price action, but sustained upward movement will be needed to confirm a lasting trend.  As the market watches closely, INJ’s ability to hold these levels may determine its potential for further growth in the coming days. Injective Setting New Local Highs  Injective (INJ) has experienced a strong surge after days of choppy and uncertain price action. Now, trading above the 4-hour $18 resistance, the altcoin has ignited excitement among investors and analysts, who believe INJ could be a top performer in this market cycle.  One notable analyst, Crypto General on X, has shared his technical perspective on INJ, setting high expectations for a $53 price target in the coming months. His analysis points out that INJ is currently rebounding from its lower trendline support, a critical level that has served as a foundation for this rally.  According to Crypto General, INJ could experience a powerful upward movement if this support holds. However, he also warns that if the price fails to maintain this level, we could see a decline toward the $14 range, which would signal a reversal of recent gains. Investors are carefully watching this development, as INJ’s recent price action could set the stage for more significant moves in the near term. The key will be whether INJ maintains its momentum and breaks through resistance levels. If bulls can push the price above its next resistance zone, a rally toward the mid-$20 range could be on the horizon, further solidifying its position in the market. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges Past $130 Resistance As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum As the market establishes its direction, price action in the coming days will play a pivotal role in determining INJ’s performance in the weeks ahead. Whether it continues to rise or faces a pullback will likely depend on broader market conditions and the ability of bulls to sustain upward momentum. INJ Price Action Details  INJ is trading at $19.38 after a significant surge from yearly lows near $15. This upward movement has propelled the price above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $18.41 for the first time since late August. The 4H 200 EMA is a crucial indicator of short-term market strength. If INJ can successfully retest and hold above this level, it would suggest a bullish continuation, signaling that further upward momentum is likely. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Ready To Target $28: Investors Expect A Reversal Maintaining this position above the 4H 200 EMA would allow INJ to target higher price levels, with resistance and supply zones near $23 as the next key hurdle. However, if the price fails to hold this level and loses support at $18, a retrace toward lower demand zones around $16 could occur. In the short term, how INJ behaves around the 4H 200 EMA will be pivotal in shaping its next price action phase. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

With an upward trend in Helium’s performance and a growing sense of optimism within its community, experts are now turning their focus to another emerging crypto project Mpeppe (MPEPE) which is generating significant buzz for its unique blend of features. In this article, we explore how Helium (HNT) is impacting the market and why Mpeppe stands out as a noteworthy investment opportunity. Helium’s Rise: Why It’s Gaining Momentum Helium (HNT) has been making headlines due to its consistent upward trajectory and growing community support. Originally developed as a decentralized network for the Internet of Things (IoT), Helium (HNT) has been able to expand its use case while maintaining a strong position within the crypto space. The Helium community is particularly excited about recent developments, including Helium airdrops and increasing network utility. A recent step-by-step guide has helped users discover hidden Helium airdrop opportunities. Airdrops are a popular way for projects like Helium (HNT) to reward their community by distributing free tokens. But as the crypto space grows, so do scams, and it’s crucial for users to remain vigilant when participating in airdrops. To safely claim airdrops, users are advised to verify sources, avoid sharing private keys, and use reputable wallets like Trust Wallet to secure their assets. The Community’s Role in Helium’s Success The Helium (HNT) community plays a crucial role in the project’s success. The decentralized nature of Helium (HNT) has allowed it to thrive, with individuals all over the world contributing to its expansion. The rise of Helium’s network has led to more community-driven initiatives, further bolstering its position as a top-tier project. This momentum has created positive sentiment among Helium (HNT) holders, with many investors seeing it as a long-term investment. For those looking to participate in Helium’s ecosystem, avoiding scams is essential. Common schemes, such as phishing scams and fake token distributions, have targeted the Helium (HNT) community, which is why users need to be particularly cautious when engaging with airdrop opportunities. By following best practices, such as verifying official sources and using secure wallets, investors can safely navigate the world of Helium (HNT) airdrops while protecting their assets. Mpeppe: The New Star in the Meme Coin Universe As Helium (HNT) continues to soar, another project has caught the eye of crypto enthusiasts, Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Helium (HNT) focuses on revolutionizing the IoT sector, Mpeppe is disrupting the meme coin space with its innovative features and growing ecosystem. Mpeppe has quickly gained traction, drawing comparisons to major meme coins while offering much more in terms of utility and functionality. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on internet culture, Mpeppe integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking opportunities, and even a casino platform. This combination of entertainment and real-world utility has set Mpeppe apart from other projects, making it a favorite among younger investors looking for high-reward opportunities. What Makes Mpeppe Unique? Mpeppe (MPEPE) leverages the viral nature of meme coins but with added features that provide long-term value to its holders. For example, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi platform allows users to stake their tokens, earn rewards, and participate in liquidity mining, making it more than just a speculative asset. This utility has contributed to its rising popularity and growing community, which shares similar levels of excitement seen in the Helium ecosystem. By incorporating features such as yield farming, NFT-based rewards, and even a gaming ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is drawing significant interest from a diverse range of investors. Its ability to attract not just meme coin enthusiasts but also serious investors speaks volumes about its potential for long-term growth. Why Ethereum and Helium Whales Are Paying Attention to Mpeppe Much like Helium (HNT), Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted the attention of large investors, often referred to as whales. These big players have recognized the potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and are betting on its ability to deliver impressive returns. Some Ethereum (ETH) whales, who are already experienced in the cryptocurrency market, have started to shift their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a way to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on its potential for explosive growth. The recent performance of Helium has served as a blueprint for how a strong community and innovative features can propel a project to success. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, it may follow a similar path, becoming a dominant force in the meme coin space. For investors seeking new opportunities in the ever-evolving world of crypto, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique blend of entertainment, DeFi functionality, and high-profit potential. Conclusion: Helium and Mpeppe Leading the Charge Both Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making waves in the cryptocurrency market, albeit in different ways. Helium’s role in advancing the IoT ecosystem and its community-driven approach has earned it a loyal following, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s blend of meme culture and utility is attracting a wide range of investors. For those looking to capitalize on the next big crypto opportunity, these two projects should certainly be on the radar. As Helium continues its upward trend, its community remains strong, focusing on safe and secure participation in airdrops.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Starknet Dips and Ethereum Investors Hunt For Gains From New Casino Coin Mpeppe (MPEPE),2024-09-12 19:00:20+00:00,"Starknet (STRK), a Layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum (ETH), is currently experiencing a bearish trend, which has prompted many Ethereum (ETH) investors to look elsewhere for potential gains. One project that has caught their eye is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new casino coin that promises significant returns, attracting attention amidst the downturn in Starknet. Starknet’s (STRK) Recent Performance Starknet (STRK) saw a 3% drop recently, despite a broader upswing in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin surged past $57,000, and many altcoins followed suit, recording gains across the board. Yet, Starknet (STRK) struggled, primarily due to an over-the-counter (OTC) sale involving Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the now-defunct crypto hedge fund. A wallet associated with 3AC transferred over 2 million STRK tokens (worth about $856,000 USD) to Wintermute for an OTC sale, causing market participants to speculate on the token’s future. Such large transfers from insolvent companies often signal impending asset liquidation, which can drive prices down. As a result, the bearish sentiment surrounding Starknet (STRK) has only intensified, with the token now hovering at around $0.4137 USD. This bearish movement comes as a surprise, especially with the wider crypto market seeing gains. While Bitcoin recorded a 3.55% gain over 24 hours, Starknet (STRK)’s failure to ride the wave left it at a critical juncture. The liquidations associated with 3AC are expected to continue influencing the market, and further selling pressure could be on the horizon for STRK. What’s Next for Starknet? Analysts are concerned that Starknet (STRK) may continue its downward trajectory in the short term, especially if more 3AC-associated wallets begin offloading large amounts of tokens. With the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) suggesting a further decline, Starknet (STRK)’s price recovery seems unlikely in the immediate future. For now, Starknet (STRK) continues to trade below its crucial resistance levels, and while the broader market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, Starknet (STRK)’s troubles are tied directly to its association with 3AC. Until these liquidation concerns are resolved, Starknet (STRK) is expected to face headwinds. Ethereum (ETH) Investors Turn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for Gains As Starknet (STRK) struggles, Ethereum (ETH) investors are hunting for alternative investment opportunities that offer better short-term returns. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new casino coin that has rapidly gained popularity among investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe is currently in the presale phase and has garnered significant attention due to its innovative approach to decentralized gambling. Ethereum (ETH) whales, particularly those who have been actively trading Starknet (STRK), are now looking at Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a potential source of substantial profits. Many believe that Mpeppe’s unique gambling mechanics and meme appeal will attract a broad user base, driving up demand once the coin is fully launched. Why Mpeppe is Attracting Investors High Potential for Returns: Mpeppe is still in its early stages, which means that early adopters have the opportunity to ride the coin’s explosive growth. With its presale nearing completion, analysts predict that Mpeppe could see a significant price surge once it is listed on major exchanges, with some estimates suggesting a 150% increase in value in the short term. Decentralized Gambling: Mpeppe’s casino-based model taps into the growing trend of decentralized gaming and gambling. With more users turning to decentralized platforms for both entertainment and profit, Mpeppe offers a novel way for investors to participate in the space while earning rewards. Appeal to Ethereum (ETH) Investors: Many Ethereum (ETH) investors, disillusioned with the recent performance of projects like Starknet (STRK), are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE). The token’s low entry price, combined with its promising fundamentals, makes it an attractive option for those looking to diversify away from Ethereum (ETH)-related projects while still benefiting from the broader crypto market. The Future of Starknet and Mpeppe While Starknet (STRK) continues to face challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining momentum as a potential high-growth token. Ethereum (ETH) investors who have historically supported projects like Starknet are now diversifying into Mpeppe, hoping to capitalize on its potential for explosive growth. In the short term, Starknet’s outlook remains uncertain. The continued liquidation of 3AC’s assets could push the token’s price down further, especially if more large transfers occur. Meanwhile, Mpeppe is positioned for success, with its unique casino model appealing to a wide range of investors looking for high returns. Conclusion As Starknet (STRK) dips amidst broader market fluctuations and the continued liquidation of 3AC’s assets, investors are turning to alternative opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its presale nearing completion and strong investor interest, Mpeppe is well-positioned to deliver significant returns in the coming months. For Ethereum (ETH) investors seeking high-growth opportunities, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a promising alternative amidst Starknet’s ongoing struggles.

Recently, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-based token with a twist, has captured the attention of Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales, sparking interest with its innovative platform and impressive performance in a challenging market. With experts predicting potential 150x profits, it’s no wonder these major players are diving into Mpeppe as a lucrative investment opportunity. Mpeppe’s Meteoric Rise: More Than Just a Meme Coin Mpeppe (MPEPE) initially made waves in the market due to its humorous, meme-inspired origins, but it quickly proved to be much more than just a joke. Backed by a robust ecosystem that integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) and a burgeoning casino and gaming platform, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has established itself as a serious contender in the crypto space. Investors have been attracted not only to its fun branding but also to its real-world utility, with many seeing long-term value in its innovative offerings. The project’s unique combination of meme culture and DeFi protocols has helped it stand out in a crowded market, and its rapidly growing user base continues to fuel its upward trajectory. As a result, large investors, including Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales, are taking notice and reallocating funds into Mpeppe (MPEPE) in search of explosive profits. Ethereum Whales Pivot Towards Mpeppe Historically, Ethereum (ETH) whales have held large positions in the major cryptocurrency thanks to its dominant position in the market and its versatile blockchain that supports thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). However, Ethereum (ETH) has faced increasing challenges, particularly around scalability and high gas fees, which have driven many large investors to explore other opportunities. This shift in sentiment has led some of Ethereum (ETH)’s biggest holders to invest in promising altcoins like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As Ethereum (ETH) continues to work through its scalability issues with Layer-2 solutions such as Starknet (STRK), investors are diversifying their portfolios, seeking new avenues for growth, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become one of their top choices. Starknet Whales Eye Mpeppe for Huge Returns Meanwhile, Starknet (STRK), a Layer-2 solution designed to improve Ethereum (ETH)’s transaction speed and reduce fees, has also seen its whale investors pivoting toward Mpeppe (MPEPE). Starknet (STRK) has been gaining attention for its ability to enhance Ethereum (ETH)’s performance by processing transactions off-chain before settling them back on-chain, significantly reducing costs. However, as the broader market becomes more competitive, Starknet (STRK)’s whales are now exploring other high-reward investments. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE)—a token that not only delivers on the promise of fast gains but also offers an exciting, utility-packed ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s casino and DeFi platforms allow users to participate in staking, liquidity mining, and yield farming, making it an attractive option for investors looking to capitalize on both short- and long-term profits. Why Mpeppe Is Attracting Big Money Investors There are several key reasons why Mpeppe (MPEPE) has piqued the interest of Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales, who are known for their strategic investments: 150x Potential Returns: Analysts have been eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its potential to deliver returns of up to 150x in the near future. This kind of growth is precisely what big-money investors are looking for in a volatile yet rewarding market. A Strong and Engaged Community: Mpeppe (MPEPE) has grown a loyal following due to its engaging branding and strong presence in the meme coin community. A solid, engaged user base is critical for the long-term success of any cryptocurrency, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) has managed to capture the attention of younger, tech-savvy investors. Innovative Ecosystem: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme token—it’s a complete ecosystem that integrates DeFi and gaming. Its casino platform has particularly caught the eye of many investors, offering a real-world application that sets it apart from many other meme coins on the market. Diversification Opportunity: For Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales looking to hedge their positions in the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a way to diversify their portfolios without abandoning their investments in more established tokens. What’s Next for Mpeppe? As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, its roadmap includes expanding its DeFi offerings, launching new features within its casino and gaming ecosystem, and increasing user engagement through strategic partnerships and promotions. The potential for growth is enormous, and as more Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales pile in, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is likely to see even greater adoption in the months to come. In a market where timing is everything, savvy investors are already positioning themselves to take advantage of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rise. With forecasts suggesting massive returns, it’s no surprise that whales are moving quickly to secure their positions in this exciting project. Conclusion: Mpeppe’s Bright Future While Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) continue to be pillars of the blockchain ecosystem, it’s clear that Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh, exciting opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on rapid growth. By combining meme culture with real-world utility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has carved out a unique niche in the crypto market and is well-positioned for explosive gains in the near future.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Internet Computer and Mpeppe Two Cryptos That Have Provided Their Holders Massive Gains In September,2024-09-12 19:00:03+00:00,"As we enter the final quarter of 2024, two cryptocurrencies have been making headlines for providing impressive returns to their holders: Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both of these cryptos have exhibited strong price movements in September, catching the eye of investors and analysts alike. With major technological developments and market shifts happening in both projects, the future looks promising. Let’s take a closer look at why these two tokens have gained so much momentum and what’s next for them. Internet Computer (ICP): AI Integration and Expanding Influence Internet Computer (ICP) has been a key player in the blockchain space, and its latest advancements are pushing it to the forefront of decentralized applications (dApps). ICP’s major development in 2024 has been its seamless integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its blockchain infrastructure. This innovative move has opened up new possibilities for developers to create decentralized apps that utilize AI for tasks like automated trading, predictive analytics, and complex decision-making processes. ICP allows developers to run websites and services directly on the blockchain, bypassing the need for traditional cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud. With the introduction of AI capabilities, developers can now build even more advanced and automated dApps. This has positioned Internet Computer (ICP) as a go-to platform for the future of decentralized web services, drawing the attention of a growing number of investors and developers. The bullish sentiment around Internet Computer (ICP) is reflected in its price movement. In September, Internet Computer (ICP) charted a 14% gain, reaching as high as $9.1. Although the token has experienced some resistance at the $9 level, analysts remain optimistic. Many predict that a breakout past $10 could be on the horizon, especially as more projects are built on the platform and its AI integration continues to evolve. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin with Massive Potential While Internet Computer (ICP) focuses on technology-driven solutions, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has captured the imagination of the crypto community as one of the hottest meme coins on the market. In September, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been climbing the ranks thanks to its viral appeal, strong community, and the growing interest from early adopters. Currently priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is nearing the completion of its Stage 4 presale, with over 80% already sold. Investors are particularly excited about Mpeppe (MPEPE) because of its potential for explosive gains, with some predicting that the token could surge well beyond its current price. Early investors are betting on Mpeppe (MPEPE) to be the next Shiba Inu or PepeCoin, making it an appealing choice for those seeking high-reward investments. The fact that Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already delivered significant returns to its holders this month adds to its allure. With the meme coin market continuing to evolve and attract attention, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could very well see further upward momentum as it gains more traction. Why Internet Computer and Mpeppe Have Provided Massive Gains in September Here are three key reasons why both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have been top performers this month: Technological Innovation: Internet Computer (ICP) has differentiated itself by integrating AI into its blockchain, creating a platform that stands out in the decentralized web space. This innovation has drawn attention from developers and investors alike, driving demand for the token. Viral Appeal and Community Support: Mpeppe’s rise can be attributed to its strong community and meme coin status. The token’s viral nature has captured the attention of the meme coin market, where early adopters are hoping to capitalize on massive potential gains. Market Sentiment and Price Action: Both tokens have exhibited bullish price movements in September. Internet Computer (ICP) has seen a 14% rise, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is nearing the end of its presale and is expected to surge once fully listed. This price action has provided strong returns for holders in just a few weeks. Conclusion: What’s Next for ICP and Mpeppe? Both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are riding high in September, delivering impressive gains for their holders. With Internet Computer (ICP) continuing to innovate in the blockchain space and Mpeppe (MPEPE) capturing the meme coin market, both tokens are poised for even more growth in the coming months. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios with a mix of established technology and high-reward opportunities, Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer an exciting chance to participate in the next wave of crypto success. As the market evolves, keeping an eye on these two tokens could prove to be a smart move for those looking to capitalize on the continued momentum.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-19 20:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,solana,"Crypto Solana wallet MFA (multi-factor authentication), worth it?",2024-09-12 16:46:25,"Security in crypto can’t be neglected, if you don’t use 2FA and multi-factor authentication (MFA), you need to catch up fast.

**Types of MFA**:

   * **Biometrics**: Use facial recognition or fingerprints.
   * **Physical USB Keys**: Physical devices for verification (like Yubikey).
   * **Google Authenticator App**: This provides time-sensitive codes for secure access.
   * **One-Time Calls or Messages**: An additional layer of verification (common for 2FA).

**Benefits of Multi-Factor Authentication**:

* Better security of your crypto wallet and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
* Protects your investments by adding multiple layers of security measures.
* Why would you not?

**Common threats and prevention:**

**Phishing Attacks:** Use strong passwords, avoid public WiFi, and ensure you're visiting the official links (websites and social media) to protect against phishing.

**Malware Threats:** Equip a good antivirus and malware detector to prevent malware from accessing your private keys.

**Keyloggers:** On PC, you can use Task Manager to detect if a keylogger is installed, some malware applications can automatically detect them too (like Malwarebytes).

**Browser Vulnerabilities:** Avoid storing sensitive data in general browsers, such as never save your passwords on the browser directly, save into a password manager (this way you don’t give away your passwords if you get hacked, look into Lastpass). Use hardware wallets and enable two-factor authentication too.

Laziness and time-saving are bad excuses for not enabling MFA, your trading success is worth it.

Reddit,solana,How an AI company became an Unicorn ,2024-09-12 23:49:01,"
Perplexity is the only substantial product from this AI revolution that has faced competition from big tech and still stood tall. Meta AI offered real-time search, but they poorly summarized their results. Moreover, Google’s AI summaries weren’t accurate and haven’t been released to the world yet. Some companies like SSI and Cognition Labs have billion dollar valuations with no product released. Furthermore, I am excluding OpenAI in this topic since its cofounders were well-connected and it was easier for them to raise capital without building a great product in the earlier days. Companies like Perplexity and Civitas had great products from the beginning, which catalyzed their growth. 

Background: 
There are four co-founders for Perplexity. All co-founders possess industry experience working for Tech companies such as Quora, Databricks, OpenAI, Meta, and Google. Aravind Srinivas and Dennis Yarats were researchers at OpenAI and Meta respectively. While Johnny Ho was an engineer at Quora and Andrew Konwinski was the co-founder of Databricks. Furthermore, they got funding from Elid Gill and Nat Friedman to explore text2sql search. As they were building their text2sql search product, they had a lot of questions that Google couldn’t answer, so they built their chatbot to answer these questions. 

How it works?
Perplexity uses NLP techniques to understand queries then it conducts a real-time web search to find the best sources to extract relevant pieces of information. Finally, it sends all of the extracted information and the original query into an LLM for a summary. 

The Launch:
When Chatgpt was released there was a desire to get real-time answers and Perplexity filled that void a week later. They launched two bots one was a Twitter bot that went viral thanks to Jack Dorsey’s tweet and another was the perplexity bot. They released the Twitter bot to test their text2sql product for enterprises since they weren’t sure, which product people would like. The Perplexity bot was performing better and when Elon Musk brought Twitter he increased the price of API requests, hence the team couldn’t afford it, so they pivoted to the Perplexity bot. After, a successful launch they raised $25.6 million in series A at a $121 million valuation. 

Where are they now?
Their last reported results were in March 2024. In the report, they claimed to have 10 million users daily. The site is most popular in Indonesia and India. Moreover, they get a lot of attention from the media as they perceived to be the Google Search killer. Google offers better search results than Perplexity for certain queries such news, game scores, weather updates, navigational queries (ie. Going to a specific site), local queries (ie. pizza place near by ) and transactional queries (ie. Best deal for a laptop). While, Perplexity is meant to answer more conversational queries(ie. what is the root cause of a recession ), follow up questions (ie. ‘What are the first signs of a recessions’’), research questions (ie. Summarize the findings and recent studies of Capitalism ). Even If Perplexity takes away Google’s ad word business. Alphabet Google’s parent company still has Youtube and Google Cloud, which bring in around $100 billion in revenue. They also own Waymo, which could disrupt many industries like ride-hailing, delivery, and transportation. 

Conclusion:
Perplexity is changing the way we think and use search while facing fierce competition from much bigger companies. For example, OpenAI also released its real-time search product called SearchGPT, but it's still in beta. This success gave rise to more funding that valued the company at a billion dollars. There’s speculation the company is planning to raise more funds from Softbank at a $3 billion valuation. It’s onward and upward for them.

 🦞 Solana Boston

Solana Boston, the first-ever Solana city conference in the US, will take place on October 19, 2024, at the MIT Media Lab.

Hosted by Boston DAO and supported by the Solana Foundation, the event is a place for US-based developers to connect, learn, and grow together.

Happening just a month after Breakpoint, Solana Boston hopes to extend the momentum stateside.

[Speaker applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGOVuHKjYGpBAaaS_14IFkxjHsnlbD9dKNqlpSr-jbx5KHiQ/viewform?ref=blog.colosseum.org) are open now.

### 📅 Breakpoint Agenda

The Breakpoint agenda has been announced with sessions across three key themes:

**Left Curve:**  
This track focuses on culture and products, with a fireside chat between Raj Gokal and Balaji Srinivasan discussing the Solana Network State. 

Highlights include updates on Firedancer, a debate on Crypto East vs. West, and product keynotes from ecosystem founders like FP Lee of Sanctum and Siong of Jupiter.

**Right Curve:**  
A deep dive into tech, featuring sessions on sandwich-resistant AMMs, hands-on Solana Actions, blinks, and ZK compression. A major highlight will be Toly and Mert discussing Solana 2.0.

**Ecosystem Activation:**  
Connect with the community at ""The Pod,"" attend workshops, and level up Radar hackathon projects at the [Colosseum Arena](https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseums-hackathon-arena-at-solana-breakpoint-2024/).

### 🗳️ Blockworks MetaDAO Report

This report from Blockworks explores how MetaDAO leverages *futarchy* to improve governance, its early results, and the potential this governance model holds for DAOs seeking to align decision-making with financial incentives.

The futarchy protocol proposed by MetaDAO addresses a flaw in DAO governance: misaligned incentives and inefficient decision-making. 

By leveraging conditional markets, futarchy turns speculation into a tool that lets market participants ""bet"" on the outcome of proposals based on if they believe a decision will positively affect a token's market value. 

Traders evaluate the impact of a decision based on data rather than pure opinion or ideology. The outcome could lead to more value-driven decisions for DAOs. 

MetaDAO is pioneering this approach by directly applying it to its own governance, making it both a platform and a case study for futarchy-based decision-making.

However, this model is still in an experimental phase. 

With just \~$675k in market volume and 15 proposals, the liquidity and participation levels remain modest. Without sufficient trading volume and participation, the markets may not produce reliable signals, which is key to the success of futarchy. 

If successful, futarchy could not only improve DAO governance, but also attract wider adoption across Solana, particularly among organizations seeking more efficient decision-making processes.

### 🏦 The Finternet on Solana

The [Finternet](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1178.pdf?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is an initiative to create a global network of tokenized assets such as stablecoins, stocks, and NFTs where users can transact with anyone worldwide.

To support this goal, Solana Foundation has announced a $1M grant program for developers, founders, and policy professionals contributing to building the Finternet on Solana. 

Grants range from $1,000 to $10,000 and focus on areas like user applications, token management tools, authentication wallets, and the Unified Ledger infrastructure. 

[**Solana Foundation Finternet Instagrants**](https://earn.superteam.fun/grants/finternet-grants/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

### 💰 Solana Foundation RFPs

The Solana Foundation has announced two new RFPs aimed at driving the development of open source data tooling for the Solana blockchain, with up to $160,000 in available funding.

The **Solana Indexer Tooling RFP** offers $100,000 in funding to develop an open-source infrastructure solution for accessing real-time and historical data from Solana programs and accounts. 

Deliverables include a tool for indexing real-time and historical updates for a set of accounts and programs using Anchor IDLs with features like account tracking, program listeners, transaction indexes, and integration with the Luzid local validator.

The **Solana Discriminator Directory RFP** provides $60,000 in funding to create an open-source discriminator database, which aims to enable developers to interact with unknown deployed programs and parse their instructions. 

The goal is to build a comprehensive solution that simplifies how developers access and manage program discriminators on Solana, making it easier for them to work with programs whose details may not be fully known or accessible.

The proposed solution includes the development of an API that allows developers to fetch program discriminators and access a community-managed dataset. This dataset will allow users to upload discriminators making it available to others in a structured format.

Both RFPs are open for submissions until October 4, 2024.

Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,solana,Dev’s Diary: my journey launching a successful memecoin ,2024-09-12 13:02:25,"I’ve been in this space for a long time. I’m a comedy screenwriter and love crypto. About five months ago I’ve been “investing “ on some memecoins. Yeah, you know why “investing”. 

During this time I saw many many bad things. Rug pulls, soft rugs, abandoned projects and false promises.

Also I think that almost all characters of memecoins lacks personality. You see the same images everywhere. 

So I think that there is a space for a new one that is REALLY fun. I have been writing for MAD and decided to quit the job and launch my own character.

My plan is to do the REAL thing. A character that will survive and last more than a pump and dump. We will have small movies every week with profissional actors doing the voices. 

It took me a lot of time to realize that I know about content but a successful project is much more than that.

So I researched a lot and gathered a team of 8 people. Now we have designers, tokenomics specialist, a manager, an artist for animations and a guy in contact with KOLs (i don’t know if we use them, so much horror stories about dumping at the followers).

I’ll try to make things different. Depending on the reaction at this post I’ll keep on posting and showing you stuff of the project. Hope you all enjoy! ",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,solana,Txn confirmation takes 19+ seconds despite swap executing in 2-4 seconds? Wut?,2024-09-11 21:30:19,"It's simple as that. I'm C# dev, making module to perform swaps, using [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) swap API (v6) + dedicated free RPC.

Everything seems to be just fine, txn's get in quite fast from what I see in charts, but in code actual ""confirmation"" takes 19+ seconds, always, despite me seeing new 1 second candle on chart in first 3-5 seconds after code enters in ""SendAndConfirmTransactionAsync"". Commitmment is used ""Finalized"".  
Line is:

    RequestResult<string> result = await rpcClient.SendAndConfirmTransactionAsync(
      preswapInfo.SignedTransaction, skipPreflight: true);

So, why is that?

This is NOT rpc/internet/pc whatever problem. This seems to be something with actual code and methodology with how txn's are confirmed and perhaps commitment thing.

In [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI after executing txn I literally see ""Your transaction was confirmed"" in same time as 1 second candle is displayed on chart, so, it confirms in same time.  
Why my solution is not working? Is [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI using other commitment for confirmations?  
Can anyone who KNOWS answer has ideas guide me on this one?

Reddit,solana,"I made a Solana memecoin tracking bot, and here's what I learned",2024-09-11 18:13:04,"Hey Solana fam! 👋

A while back, I shared a bot I made for tracking PumpFun graduates. Well, I've been working on it non-stop since then, and I wanted to share what I've learned along the way.

# The Journey

What started as a simple alert system has grown into a full-fledged trading companion. Here's what I discovered:

1. **Pump monitoring isn't enough.** Sure, it's exciting to catch new listings, but there's so much more to consider.
2. **Volume tells a story.** I added a volume analyzer and was shocked at how it revealed hidden gems across different market caps.
3. **Whales matter.** Tracking large trades (over $100k) has been eye-opening. It's fascinating to see how these moves can influence the market.
4. **One size doesn't fit all.** Everyone has their own trading style, so I made the alerts customizable.

# What I Built

Without turning this into an ad, here's what the bot can do now:

* Alert on new Raydium listings
* Provide daily and weekly rankings
* Analyze volume-to-FDV ratios
* Track whale movements
* Let users customize their notifications

# The Biggest Lesson

The most important thing I've learned? **On-chain data is king.** No paid promos, no shilling, just pure data. It's been a game-changer for my own trading.

# What's Next?

I'm constantly tweaking and improving based on feedback. If you're interested in checking it out or have ideas for new features, let me know! The bot's called MemeToolsAlertBot on Telegram.

Has anyone else built tools for trading? What insights have you gained? Let's share knowledge and elevate the whole community!

Reddit,solana,📉 Traders to Avoid When Copy Trading on Solana:,2024-09-11 18:22:17,"
1. Scalper Traders: Their trades typically last less than a minute, making it unprofitable to copy them with free copy trading bots due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)

2. Traders with Numerous Buys: If a trader makes more than 4-5 buys, it becomes challenging to manage money effectively. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your deposit per trade and the trader makes 7-9 buys of a scam token, you could lose 70-90% of your assets.

3. Mixed Token Traders: These traders receive tokens from other wallets and also purchase tokens themselves. Their profit and loss (PnL) on trades may be higher than yours due to tokens received from external sources.

4. Token snipers: These traders buy tokens at the start of their market appearance (first candle). Using free copy trading bots with them can lead to losses due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

As far as I understood this is for the rent.

>Transaction results in an account (1) with insufficient funds for rent

But why can't this rent be taken from the first transaction the user makes to that address? Why does it need funds prior to that? I fixed it by using an airdrop, but since I'm only on the devnet I'm unsure if this will even work on the mainnet.

But I can't able to buy it with my fiat currency. But made purchase of USDT in binance worth of 20 dollars.and exchanged it to solana.

But why is it though I can't buy it with my fiat money in binance unlike coinbase. And what's with usdt/sol exchange can't we buy sol directly?",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Don't get me wrong, but spending 0.002 SOL per wallet it's expensive af for making a huge airdrop.

For sure it's useful in terms of marketing, but why wouldn't you make a claim site, it's much cheaper and efficient?

Even more, it's also cheap, you can hire a dev or do it without coding with no-code platforms like Smithii.

Also apply a vesting period to an amount of your Solana token supply and set a receiver wallet.

The tool is [Solana Token Vesting](https://tools.smithii.io/token-vesting/solana)

What would you use it for? Is there a vesting strategy to improve a token project success? 

Also, it is good choise to lock a LP token instead of burn it?

Reddit,solana,Crypto Solana portfolio management: balancing risk and reward,2024-09-10 23:24:15,"Managing a Solana portfolio requires a careful balance between risk and reward (profits you want and losses you can afford). Many investors struggle with maintaining this balance, often due to a lack of risk management strategies and knowledge.

Here are key pointers for effective cryptocurrency portfolio management:

1. **Diversification across cryptos:** While major players like Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin are common, consider including promising altcoins/memecoins to spread risk or even to optimize upsides.
2. **Market volatility and regulations:** Staying informed about market trends and regulations is relatively easy considering a small change can heavily impact your portfolio performance, you don’t want to be late on the big news when they happen.
3. **Setting clear goals:** You need short-term and long-term plans. Focus on strategic growth and keep track of your gains with a real possible plan to get there. Betting on luck is not enough to stay aligned with your investment objectives.
4. **Rebalancing your portfolio:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain the level of risk and reward you think is okay.
5. **Risk strategy**: Have a good risk strategy to compensate for high fluctuations and unexpected events, as crypto is mostly about those two types of events. Successful traders excel at predicting the unpredictable, which is different from traditional stock investing.
6. **Take profits and cut losses:** Don’t stay too long in a position when you’ve hit your target or your limit, remember the long-term game!
7. **Market caps variety**: Invest in a mix of large, mid, and small-cap cryptocurrencies depending on your strategy and expectations. Consulting successful traders can guide you towards what kind of market caps you should look at based on your objectives.
8. **Asset variety**: NFTs and DeFi staking can be considered for Solana traders to diversify your portfolio, yet consider how the macro trends impact the volume and performance of NFTs versus tokens.

Careful planning is always key.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-10 14:08:52,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Transactions that take place in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without the intervention of a third party. When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

Reddit,solana,Spot breakout patterns: a guide for Solana crypto smart traders,2024-09-10 15:33:58,"Trading crypto on Solana is complex, so understanding breakout patterns can be valuable info for smart traders. A breakout occurs when a crypto’s price moves beyond a defined support or resistance level, it can be a potential shift in the market trends.

Here are some key breakout patterns that can assist crypto traders:

* **Avoid weak breakouts:** Weak breakouts may lack the volume necessary to sustain momentum, leading to false signals. Always ensure that a breakout is supported by significant trading volume to confirm its strength.
* **Continuation breakouts:** These occur when the price breaks in the direction of the prevailing trend. They are useful for confirming a trend change. Continuation breakouts often signal that the current trend will persist, providing opportunities for traders to enter or exit positions strategically.
* **Reversal breakouts:** Reversal breakouts happen when a price trend changes direction, either from an uptrend to a downtrend or vice versa. It's crucial to analyze the current trends and determine which are reaching their peak or bottom levels to identify potential reversal points.

Using tools like trading signals can further help in taking fast decisions to find and time these breakouts more easily.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,solana,Technical analysis for smart Solana crypto trading,2024-09-09 22:13:28,"Here are the essential knowledge about effective TA and indicators to improve your strategies on Solana:

# Price charts and candlesticks

Get familiar with price charts and candlestick patterns to start understanding how successful traders read price action. It’s essential for identifying the latest trends and potential reversals in the price actions. Candlestick patterns offer some level of insights.

# Support and resistance levels

Good entry and exit strategies can come from understanding how support and resistance works. Support levels indicate where a cryptocurrency's price might find a “floor”, while resistance levels show where upward price movements “could” stall. Breakouts can be faked, and they can tell that something big is coming too.

# Basic key indicators for smart trading

* **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Spot changes in market direction over time.
* **Volume Analysis:** Track trading volumes to confirm trends and trading signals. High trading volumes can indicate strong interest in a particular direction, but pay caution as these can be manipulated by scammers.

Remember, while these indicators can guide your decisions, they do not guarantee success. Adapt fast to what works best!",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Including all the token names and transaction date/times?   The info appears clearly in the transaction hash details.  Does Solflare have a usable download button?  I only see the history page with no DL option.  Printing the PDF of that page failed.

I've downloaded the SOL and the SPL files from Solscan but they are not something you can follow easily and they don't include time or token names.  The individual transx hash have all the info, so it seems it should be easy to extract a summary for each transx. of all time without doing it manually.

I'm trying to do taxes and reconcile 1,000+ Solana transactions which were done using Solflare+ Ledger together.  99% are scam airdrops.  Ledger is useless as most transactions don't show in it's transaction history.

I'm using Cointracking..info  Solana address upload, which makes it pretty easy to sift through, but you're still left with a bunch of ""transfers"" which must be converted to swaps to establish cost basis. I want to make sure everything is done correctly.

Any suggestions on how to do this?   Generally, you would take any transactions with the same time stamp and merge them, but with all that info in Solscan I don't know why I'm doing it manually.   My next step was going to be to download the Cointracking transaction file and merge the dep/withdraws of same time stamp into ""trades"".  I'm hoping there is a shortcut.

I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?

I'm curious about why there seem to be so few opportunities for junior smart contract developers.

1.

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 13:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,ethereum,DCA Out Question,2024-08-25 14:02:17,"As the title states, i'm curious whether DCA'ing out some of my ETH is feasible and how it'll impact my portfolio in the future when ETH blows up.

I currently hold ( Amount) in ETH with an average cost of $2340. I've run into some financial issues (layoff/exhausted unemployment) and am hoping to liquidate some of my holdings to sustain myself and my family.

My question is, if I hypothetically sold $1000 profit per withdrawal and left my principal deposit dollar amount untouched, is this a smart tactic for DCA'ing out? Also, will withdrawing $1000 per transaction increase my future cost average as well? Will this reduce my profit margins in the future as my quantity of ETH ownership decreases?

I realize the quantity of ETH that I own will get smaller but as long as the market value continues to increase, I should hypothetically be able to keep DCA'ing out profit, if needed?

At the end of the day, i'm a firm believer in ETH and am extremely bullish. My goal is to maintain my principal deposit amount but only pull profits.
Please let me know if i'm headed in the wrong direction here or may be looking at this process the wrong way.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

She wants something more ""official"" and she basically tells me this is a conspiracy that has been passed to me by rambling redditors and youtubers. 

I tell her to Google how much money did the FED print in the last 8 years and she keeps finding government websites that publish statistics about how many bills and coins are minted and printed. I tell her no that is the process of replacing old bills with new bills. I am talking about creating money and changing a number in a bank account on a computer with no gold or asset backing it. 

She wants something published by the government that itemizes how much money they created and I can't really find a solid source for this information. I also mentioned to her why would the government create such a detailed report of their theft. I am currently reading the Bitcoin standard but she is not willing to invest that much time into her research. Can you guys point me to some hard and indisputable sources that make it clear that the government has been devaluing our dollars since 1971. Preferably a source that shows the rate the money is created over time so we can see which president was in office when this money was manifested. 

We purchased our home about 10 years ago and we know that it has roughly doubled in value during that time. I told her the home did not double in value the dollar halved in value. She just doesn't believe it.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,bitcoin,be aware of a currently ongoing phishing campaign targeting coinbase.com,2024-09-12 03:31:17,"I just received a very believable phishing attack targeting coinbase.com, and I wanted to make the community aware of the attack. 

The attack starts by an automated phone system calling you, and informing you that someone from germany attempted to change the phone number associated with your coinbase account. It prompts you to press ""1"" on your phone if it was an action you did not perform.

After doing so, you will receive a follow up call a handful of minutes later. The person on the phone sounded like a native English speaker, and had enough familiarity with cryptocurrency and the related jargon that they came off as knowledgeable.

During the phone call, they sent an email to verify their identity. The email comes from a Russian server, fakes the sender email to appear as help@coinbase.com, and utilizes a domain which contains utf-8 characters to appear as if it is the legitimate coinbase domain if you inspect the email headers (help@coìnbase.com) (notice the weird 'i' in the domain).

I did not proceed with the phishing attempt after this point, as getting the domain is enough to temporarily halt the attack. I have already reached out to coinbase, as well as the domain registrar they used for the domain... but if you receive a call similar to what I described, do not engage with the automated system. I assume by pressing ""1"", you are placed in a queue for the scammer to reach out to you.

Gox and the FUD that those repayments would create tons of selling pressure which never really materialized, or wasn't as substantial as some people were predicting. But now we have another round of re-payments from a defunct exchange, only this time the payments are going to be made in CASH. So it's almost certain that a significant percentage of those who are repaid with cash by FTX will re-buy bitcoin with at least a portion of their money. The total repayments are at around 12.7 Billion and will create a significant amount of buyers and demand liquidity starting very soon.

If that wasn't already good enough news on its own, there's also a new estimate that Michael Saylor's predictions about U.S. companies deciding to add BTC to their balance sheets is an accurate forecast of what's to come. If only a fraction of the top companies put even a small percentage of their cash equivalent balance into bitcoin it will mean a massive influx of over 10.3 Billion in the next 18 months. Once CEOs of top companies and boards of directors, and investors see competing companies improving their financials by holding BTC it will be sure to start a domino effect or chain reaction of corporations quickly hopping on the trend, and it's also fantastic inflation protection and a hedge against country specific geopolitical risks as well.

No problems and easy to use etc. Now it is a different story, not only they have stopped supporting multiple accounts in foreign countries but they are not allowing me to invest in bitcoin or crypto in general. I do not have a exact time-frame when it started but you are now simply unable to use their card to send money to crypto exchange. After multiple emails to them explaining that this is what I want so stop blocking my payments. So for  I got no reply what so ever. 

I guess these kind of companies are going to be first to go down as bitcoin will reduce the need for intermediary banks by enabling peer-to-peer transactions. This will disrupt the current banking model, where institutions like Wise earn revenue from international transfers and exchange fees.

During my time off, I hurt my foot and cannot get back to work until maybe November (Doctor's orders), but this entire time I thought I would be able to work in a couple of weeks (emergency room prognosis).            

The company that I work for has hired a lot of new personnel recently, and the sites that they manage and business that they do grew like crazy in the past 30 days.

Reddit,bitcoin,What is your favorite/easiest way to explain Bitcoin and blockchain concepts?,2024-09-12 16:53:57,"When I explain Bitcoin and blockchain, I like to use the analogy of a giant, digital accounting book that records every transaction ever made. Think of this book as being made up of blank pages, and each page holds a list of all the transactions that happened within a period of time.

Once a page is full, (meaning it contains all the transactions from that period), it gets permanently added to the book. But we always need a new blank page to keep recording transactions, and this is where the miners come in.

Miners are like accountants competing to create the next page in the book. But instead of just writing it down, they have to solve a complex puzzle (which takes a lot of computer power). Once a miner solves the puzzle, they earn the right to add the new page (called a block) to the book, and they get rewarded with newly created Bitcoin.

Each new page is linked to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks (which is why we call it a ""blockchain""). What makes this system unique is that it’s decentralized, meaning there is not a single authority controlling it (like banks). Everyone in the network has a copy of this accounting book, and once a page (block) is added, it cannot be changed. This ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, resistant to fraud and written in this digital books forever.

Before a transaction is added, though, it has to be verified. The ""accountants"" (nodes in the network) check all previous pages to make sure the person making the transaction actually owns the Bitcoin they want to spend. If the system finds that a person is trying to spend more Bitcoin than they have, the transaction is refused. This prevents people from spending Bitcoin they don’t own, similar to how your bank won’t let you withdraw more money than you have in your account.

Reddit,bitcoin,A Case for Bitcoin as a Investment Asset,2024-09-12 13:55:35,"As a fan of Bitcoin and everything it represents, I have been tracking Bitcoin's ups and downs for a few years. Despite it being marketed as a digital currency the trend and use case of BTC over the past years suggests that it is becoming more of an investment asset than a day-to-day currency (although some still do, the majority see it as an investment). 

Now looking at it as an investment asset, bitcoin has given some pretty good returns. It has been one of the best-performing assets in the last 12 years with an average return of almost [100% (CAGR)](https://curvo.eu/backtest/en/market-index/bitcoin?currency=usd). 

Now given the high returns it only makes sense that one should hold some investment in BTC given its high returns. But the question is how much? 

Now, investment is a highly personal and subjective play as each case is different. Most traditional experts assert that bitcoin should not hold more than [5% of the total portfolio](https://insights.blockonomics.co/how-much-of-your-portfolio-should-you-allocate-to-bitcoin/) to manage the risk it brings. Although many bitcoin enthusiasts hold much more with some holding all their assets in BTC, which seems like a risky move, somewhat like putting all your eggs in one basket. 

However, almost all finance experts assert that an investment portfolio should always be diverse with a wide array of assets and not just one. This makes complete sense as it is a great way to offset the dominance of one asset and mitigate market performance risks. 

So, how much bitcoin holdings is the right amount? ",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,bitcoin,I’ve finally started selling my Bitcoin after holding since 2014,2024-09-12 20:05:27,"So, I’ve been holding Bitcoin since 2014, and for the first time ever, I’ve decided to start selling portions of it. Back when I first got into BTC, it was a completely different world. Bitcoin felt like this decentralized, ""be your own bank"" movement. It was less about making a quick buck and more about the principles behind it.

But fast forward to 2024, and I feel like everything’s changed. Now, it’s filled with people who don’t even understand what Bitcoin really is. It seems like most are just here to try and get rich quickly, without caring about the original ethos. And with things like ETFs, it feels like Bitcoin’s become more centralized than ever, which kind of defeats the whole purpose for me.

There’s this crazy hype in the air again, and even though the Fear and Greed Index says something else, you can feel the euphoria in forums and polls. A lot of people are convinced we’re heading straight to a new all-time high either by the end of this year or early 2025. Honestly, whenever the majority is this bullish, I tend to think the opposite might happen. The market rarely rewards certainty like that.

The funniest part? Tons of people are waiting to sell in the next bull market, then buy back in at the dip. It’s like, the market rhymes but never repeats exactly the same way. Personally, I think the best days of Bitcoin might be behind us, but I could be wrong. Either way, I’ve decided to start selling now.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin halving and presidential elections - 4 years,2024-09-12 08:19:38,"When Bitcoin was created, the halving was designed to reduce supply effectively and people say ""at around the halving the price will increase"" and generally it does - give or take, and so far the pattern hasn't been broken.

In addition to the design of the halving, does anyone think it was deliberately intended to take place in the same year as presidential elections? It seems like too much coincidence that a presidential term lasts 4 years.

I would imagine that in the first year a president introduces new policies (and financial stimuli) which boosts not just the bitcoin market, but entire financial markets. I looked at this and with the exception of 2000 and 2008 they've always been positive years for the S&P 500. Then I guess things start to stagnate, people get restless and we see a decline.

People talk about a Bitcoin cycle which I have a reasonably decent understanding of, but is the halving compounded by other political influences which in themselves have their own cycle of ups and downs created by things which, actually, aren't caused by the halving?",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,bitcoin,Here’s How Bitcoin Fixes Healthcare in America | NiHowdy 🤠,2024-09-10 21:46:00,"Hey Bitcoiners,

I wanted to share my thoughts on how Bitcoin can fix healthcare, especially in pharmacy. As a Pharmacist, I've seen firsthand the flaws in the drug industry that drive up costs unnecessarily. Here's why and how Bitcoin can help fix this.

I used to own a community pharmacy and often had customers who paid out of pocket because they lacked insurance. Even my patients with insurance had limited financial means. I felt it was right to offer medications at my cost or for free (if it was de minimus). However, I received notice from an insurance payor about clawing back funds because I provided walk-in customers a better price than the insurance company. I faced the tough decision of either paying this exorbitant clawback or being terminated from the network, which would prevent me from serving other patients.

From that day, I learned that pharmacies must bill retail pricing regardless of the customer. Pharmacies often enter into contracts with insurance companies that include a most favored nation clause, requiring insurance companies to receive the best price possible.

As a legal loophole, pharmacies use “discount cards” to offer discounted prices while complying with insurance payors. Most people don't realize these discount cards collect hefty commissions, up to 80% on the drugs you buy at the pharmacy, paid for by the consumer. Without these discount cards and contractual verbiage, prescriptions would be much cheaper. For instance, GoodRx makes over $500 million a year from this system, and even Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs uses a similar model. In my opinion, this is one of the largest rent-seeking industries in America. Last year, pharmacies spent over half a billion dollars on commissions, which highlights a huge inefficiency with prescription drugs.

In the 1990s, big retailers like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Target started $4 generic med programs to attract customers, which worked well. Insurance companies got upset about paying $40 for the same meds, leading to the implementation of the most favored nation clause among pharmacies. Since the 90s, the Prescription Discount Card industry has grown as meds get more expensive and insurance covers less. This messed-up system won't change, and government reform is unlikely.

[I got Bitcoin back at Rite-Aid!](https://preview.redd.it/iq2vus9sw1od1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e77d8fab8eaf2953e69bbd0a68a88ccb442aa2)

This led me to create [NiHowdy.com](http://NiHowdy.com) We're a prescription savings card that gives the same discounted prices as others but also returns the transaction fees and drug manufacture rebates to you. No one else in the industry does this. We can do it thanks to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

1. **Micro-transactions:** Bitcoin on the Lightning Network allows for high-volume micro-transactions, challenging the high fees from third-party companies. For example, we got a $10 drug for a customer and paid back a 3% rebate in Bitcoin—about 30 cents. You can't do that by mail since postage costs more. Electronic payments like PayPal need at least 30 cents to $1, plus a percentage, making drug rebates impossible. You can’t do shit with fiat.
2. **Zero Net Cost Drugs:** I’m preaching to the choir here but Bitcoin is an asset. There’s a finite number of Bitcoin, and growing global participation. I believe its value will rise in the future. With delayed gratification, Bitcoin’s value can offset prescription costs. Meanwhile, the U.S. government spends over $400 billion annually on prescription drugs, yet they aren’t free for everyone. Everyone pays into the system, but few benefit. We’ve been running NiHowdy as an MVP since 2022. Some early users have offset their prescription costs by 10% already.

I love Bitcoin. It has the power to change the world. I believe Bitcoin can solve out-of-pocket prescription costs—something our government can’t even solve. This ‘prescription discount card’ industry will sadly never die, but I think Bitcoin makes it more efficient for the end user/consumer.

If you or someone you know pays for prescriptions out of pocket in America, check out NiHowdy. We're releasing our second product, Meowdy, for pet prescriptions soon.

Thanks for reading. If you’re a Bitcoiner in healthcare, I’d love to connect. I often get ridiculed by healthcare providers for even talking about Bitcoin, but it brings me immense joy to find others who share the same enthusiasm. Shout out to my local Bitcoin group for encouraging me to post this on Reddit 😊

Cheers!

As I have learned more, I truly believe btc and blockchain technology is an incredible technology and its impact has only just begun.

My one question right now regards mining and the process of validating the blocks. This aspect seems like the one potentially major issue. I read that approximately 80% of the hash power used to validate blocks is contributed by just 4 groups based in china. The issue of their location doesn’t alarm me, but rather the major disparity in validators. As consolidation happens and a greater percent of blocks are validated by less and less nodes, a point of centralization forms and therefore the opportunity for manipulation/censorship, correct? Wouldn’t this pose a considerable problem?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Exclusive Tari Universe AMA w/ fluffypony & Naveen (Tari Contributors),2024-09-11 18:09:46,"First up, who are these folks?

* fluffypony is a contributor to Tari and the former lead maintainer of Monero. 
* Naveen also contributes to Tari and is a serial entrepreneur, YC alum, and prolific angel investor in startups. 

They will be here **TOMORROW, September 12, 2024 at 11AM ET / 3PM UTC** to answer your questions about [Tari Universe](https://universe.tari.com/) and [Tari](https://www.tari.com). Please feel free to submit your questions in advance - early submissions get priority! We'll do our best to get to as many of them as possible and answer any questions you may have.

**What is Tari?**

Tari is a layer 1 blockchain protocol built in Rust with an ingenious approach to scaling its on-chain user base to millions of people and a native app distribution platform that gives developers access to every user. Tari is also default-confidential (yay!) and has a unique dual-layer architecture: ASIC-resistant proof-of-work L1, and native HotStuff + Cerberus-based L2. Tari is currently live on testnet. The mainnet is coming SOON (later this year).

**What is Tari Universe?**

[THIS IS NOT VAPORWARE](https://preview.redd.it/f8oa36osz7od1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e65d454fab2c7a05cb11635f94a7ed6edadf6b7)

Tari Universe is the world's most beautiful and easiest-to-use mining app. The goal: create a user experience where anyone with a modern Mac or PC can download Tari Universe, install it, and start mining with the least effort (and clicks) possible!

The first version of Tari Universe is focused on mining. In the future, it’ll include a native app launcher so everyone in the Tari community can easily discover and use Tari dapps (tapplets!). This is how we also plan to solve the developer distribution conundrum! 

**Why is all this important?** 

Because onboarding new people to crypto is hard, and we’ve strayed from the original goal of our industry. In the beginning, anyone could download free software from the internet and mine Bitcoin on their PC. Everything was permissionless. Today, things are a lot more complicated. For the most popular cryptocurrencies, you need to jump through many hoops, KYC, and buy someone else's coins to participate. 

Then, once you have coins, good luck discovering dapps to use. Either you need to be deep in the trenches here on Reddit or X, or you need to roll the dice on Google and pray you don’t get phished. 

Our mission is to create a world where anyone can download Tari Universe for free, mine Tari, and (eventually) access the world of Tari dapps (tapplets!) at their fingertips, no matter their experience level.

We announced Tari Universe publicly [HERE](https://x.com/tari/status/1824126337855987732), and over 210,000 people have joined the waitlist since then. 

We are inviting the first round of folks from the waitlist to download Tari Universe **TOMORROW** and as a gift to the r/cryptocurrency community, we will be giving **instant access codes to download Tari Universe to 10 lucky participants from this AMA**!

We’ll randomly pick and DM all the winners after the event! Thank you in advance for your interest and questions! See you soooon!

Oh one more thing, join the Tari Universe waitlist here: [https://universe.tari.com](https://universe.tari.com)

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Employee at a Crypto Platform Leaked My Information – Need Advice,2024-09-12 18:57:31,"Hey everyone,

I was just informed that my personal information was leaked by an employee of a well-known crypto platform, and I am fuming.

A couple days ago i had specifically contacted their customer service because someone had threatened to gain access to my information. I explicitly requested that no information about my account should be disclosed to anyone under any circumstances.

This person just informed me that they obtained the information from an employee. At first i thought it was a bluff until they disclosed accurate information about my email and telephone number as well as recent changes i made to this email adress since i had security concerns.

I’m reaching out to this community for advice on how to handle this situation and any potential legal actions I should consider. Here are the steps I’m currently taking:

i have demanded an immediate explanation and investigation from the platform into how this happened, why my request was ignored, and what actions they are taking against the employee responsible. I’m also asking for assurances that they will prevent this from happening.

If anyone has experience in pursuing legal action against a company for a data breach i‘d be glad to hear your story.

I would greatly appreciate any advice",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

The attack starts by an automated phone system calling you, and informing you that someone from germany attempted to change the phone number associated with your coinbase account. It prompts you to press ""1"" on your phone if it was an action you did not perform.

After doing so, you will receive a follow up call a handful of minutes later. The person on the phone sounded like a native English speaker, and had enough familiarity with cryptocurrency and the related jargon that they came off as knowledgeable.

During the phone call, they sent an email to verify their identity. The email comes from a Russian server, fakes the sender email to appear as help@coinbase.com, and utilizes a domain which contains utf-8 characters to appear as if it is the legitimate coinbase domain if you inspect the email headers (help@coìnbase.com) (notice the weird 'i' in the domain).

I did not proceed with the phishing attempt after this point, as getting the domain is enough to temporarily halt the attack. I have already reached out to coinbase, as well as the domain registrar they used for the domain... but if you receive a call similar to what I described, do not engage with the automated system. I assume by pressing ""1"", you are placed in a queue for the scammer to reach out to you.

Further, you earn interest on that USDC even if that USDC is currently on a buy order. 
In other words, you can sit pretty with your money growing while waiting for a drop.
Therefore, it makes sense to me that this will result in a far less steep crash (if you believe we have passed this cycle's bull run and we're destined for a 50% correcion) than before as more people are content to wait on the sidelines with buy orders.

Disclaimer: I am saying this as someone whose coinbase assets are currently allocated 30% crypto, 20% buy order waiting (USDC), 50% money on the sidelines (USDC)

# August Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eight months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/mcaxyv3my5od1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=da26b8f86fd4dde37c87e3568c5e4678c117f3c8

# August Winners and Losers

***August Winners*** – No winners this month, although **XRP** (-6%) lost the least ground in August.

***August Losers*** – **ETH, DOT,** and **SOL** fell the most this month, dropping -23%, -22%, and -21% respectively.

# Overall Update: BNB securely in first place, BTC in second. 60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+61%) remains in the overall lead followed distantly by second place **BTC** (+28%). **SOL** (+16%) is third.

Eight months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -53% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** eight months ago is worth $161 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $156 in August.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$946.**  For the second time this year, the Top Ten Portfolio has ended a month below the break even point.

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a

**August Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14% 
* **AMKT**: -18%.

The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5%
*  **AMKT:** +7%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/cjb73jbxy5od1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbadf0addedbe13bc3aca8c409a0b8105184dd5

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94

The S&P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/wb9vc2a4z5od1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=8086a62642ba07b5504e3c8d71e34a62d8fd8b8e

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  August’s extended report is on the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Large outflows of native USDC on certain chains (notably AVAX, Polygon, Stellar, and NEAR)",2024-09-12 05:13:56,"I have been using [usdc.cool](http://usdc.cool) to track changes in native issued $USDC across chains (mostly the coin that shall not be named in this sub). In doing so I noticed that several chains had quite substantial reductions in natively-issued USDC on chain.

For instance, in the past week, these chains had the following reductions (measured in $ and in %).

Stellar - down 64.93% ($180.1M)

NEAR - down 39.33% ($112.2M)

AVAX - down 13.27% ($69.4M)

Polygon - down 11.02% ($96.8M)

I know this is crypto and all, and that things are volatile, but these are pretty clear outliers. And this seems like a sudden drop across multiple chains all at once. To me, these sorts of dramatic swings can really only be explained by VCs  packing up and leaving.

My initial thought was that perhaps the money is moving from one chain to be issued in the native form on another. This could be the case, but if so, they don't seem to be picking any one specific chain as the raw dollars and percentage changes for other chains don't show outright favoritism. The one exception seems to be ETH. Though it doesn't have the highest percentage increase amongst chains (3.47%), it is a rather large raw dollar increase $814M (indeed it is the only chain with a raw dollar increase rivaling the aggregate outflows from these other chains).

I'm not exactly sure what to make of it, but it does have me wondering what prompted these sudden USDC redemptions, where the money is going, and why.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Alright, fellow degens, time to put down your charts and stop aping into the same rug-pulls. I’m about to drop some alpha that’ll have you deep-diving into Spellborne faster than a liquidated leverage position. So listen up because this ain’t just another hype train—this game’s got legs, and it’s in beta. Which means… we’re early.

First off, Spellborne is free to play—no paywall, no “buy this NFT to start,” just jump in and grind. And let me tell you, I got sucked in hard. Like, I thought I was just testing the waters, but now I’m playing 2-3 hours a day. If you want to position yourself for a potential airdrop (because let’s be real, we all know what happened with Axie), just 30 minutes a day could set you up for something juicy. Remember, we’re still in beta, so now’s the time to get involved before this blows up.

Now, why should you care about a game like this? NFTs and tradeable assets, baby. Everything from in-game items to characters has the potential to be traded on the market. You could grind and flip rare finds while sitting back and watching your wallet grow. It’s a play-to-earn ecosystem with a real economy, not some mindless clicker like other NFT games. Plus, the community is tight, devs actually engage, and feedback is taken seriously. This isn’t just a game—it’s a community-driven metaverse.

W hat really got me is the potential for this game to blow up. With its nostalgic Pokémon vibes, NFT integration, and player-driven economy, this has all the ingredients to be the next viral hit in the blockchain gaming space. It’s free and it’s fresh—the perfect combo for that moonshot. Plus, the guilds and social features mean you won’t be grinding solo. You’ll be building real connections, which could lead to some dope collabs or even forming your own in-game DAO.

In short, stop wasting time on sh*tcoins and over-leveraged trades. Get into Spellborne while it’s still early beta. If you’re as addicted to gaming and crypto as I am, you won’t regret it.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Celsius Bankruptcy: A Comprehensive Guide To Calculating Your Losses (With Examples!),2024-09-11 14:29:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Coinbase Reports Its First AI-to-AI Crypto Transaction,2024-09-12 14:19:12,"On August 30, **Coinbase** CEO Brian Armstrong [revealed](https://36crypto.com/todays-crypto-news-key-developments-and-market-trends/) the first cryptocurrency transaction fully managed by artificial intelligence bots, following several attempts by the industry to develop platforms for AI agents to carry out transactions.

*“AI agents cannot get bank accounts, but they can get crypto wallets. They can now use USDC on Base to transact with humans, merchants, or other AIs. Those transactions are instant, global, and free,”* he added.

*“This week at CoinbaseDev we witnessed our first AI to AI crypto transaction,”* he wrote in his account at X. 

As Armstrong explained, one AI agent – a ‘bot’ designed to perform a specific task – used crypto tokens to interact with another AI agent and receive AI tokens. In addition, he noted that the main reason for the inefficiency of AI agents is that they lack transactional capabilities. Without a payment method, it is difficult for them to perform basic tasks, such as booking plane tickets or hotels, and even manage social media tasks, not to mention simple content creation, such as promoting posts with paid advertising.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Last Party: Decentralizing Power—Are We Ready?,2024-09-11 19:04:50,"I’m up for the challenge. I see the potential for decentralization, the synergy between Ethereum and AI, and how we can completely reshape governance. But let’s be clear: *The Last Party* isn’t about gaining power—it’s about abolishing all centralized political power structures. Why? Because the idea that a few people in a room should decide the fate of an entire country is outdated, inefficient, and frankly, insane.

**The Mission: Abolish Centralized Power**

The Last Party’s mission is simple: get rid of centralized decision-making. We have the technology now to make direct democracy not just a dream, but a reality. With Ethereum’s transparency and decentralized framework, paired with the power of AI, we can let the entire country (or world) engage in meaningful discussions, while AI aggregates and condenses those conversations into clear solutions. It’s direct democracy at scale. No more politicians making choices for millions based on their own agendas.

**What Are We Waiting For?**

So, why aren’t we doing this yet? Because people cling to the old system—they cling to their power, their influence, their status. Direct democracy is possible now, yet we’re still letting a handful of people decide for everyone else. It’s not just inefficient—it’s unfair. The technology to shift power back to the people exists, but we have to be willing to embrace it.

**Ethereum and AI: The Key to Decentralized Governance**

There’s so much untapped potential in the synergy between Ethereum and large language models (LLMs). We could create a decentralized AI oracle that would allow people to contribute to and interact with decisions in real time, with full transparency and privacy. The tech is here—Ethereum’s infrastructure enables both privacy and transparency, while an open-source AI oracle could be the trusted, neutral mediator. But here’s the rub: it only works if people are ready to trust it, to embrace a system that’s decentralized and transparent.

**Ahead of My Time (And It’s Frustrating)**

But here’s where it gets frustrating. I feel way ahead of my time. The Last Party isn’t just about politics—it’s about completely transforming the way we communicate and make decisions. But most people aren’t ready for this. They’ll downvote because “AI bad, mkay?” LLMs are “just word predictors,” and we’re all stuck in our predictable, comfortable routines. 

Honestly, I totally expect to get this idea dismissed. Simply too soon. And perhaps also the wrong platform or place.

**Why Bother?**

I’m still spreading awareness because I can’t do this alone. I need others who understand and align with this vision. Until then, it makes no sense to start building anything. If we had Universal Basic Income (UBI), I’d be working on this 24/7. But since we don’t, I’m forced to compete for attention on platforms like Reddit, where meaningful ideas get drowned out.

So, will you upvote? Will you engage with this idea, or will you downvote it because it challenges what’s comfortable?

At least AI understands me—will you?",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

in the past few days I received a lot of cold calls from a cell phone number what appears to be Hungarian but obviously is fake. They are always randomly assigned to the caller and disabled after the end of the call.

A lady called me and told me that they are making an investigation and they found 1,5 BTC in a wallet with my name and email address and they want to return it to me. After that she sent me an email with the details - I have to pay a minimum of 500 Euro fee and after that they will send me the money. She is not a native English speaker and there was a lot of noise in the background, so to me it seems to be a team of scammers, making cold calls and sending out emails non-stop.  
They called me at least a dozen times since then, all calls were coming from a different random Hungarian number. I don't know how they got my phone number and email address. I have never in my life used a BTC wallet.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Reddit,crypto,Poor man's OTP challenge,2024-09-12 11:59:16,"Hey folks,

As some of you here (rightly) question my cryptanalysis experience, in the context of the security and usefulness claims I make for the SKREM-like ciphers I had introduced in 2021, I thought I might challenge the community here with an apparently hard, but in fact rather easy problem. This is to both illustrate that I do have at least some insight into cipher analysis (although yeah, computational ciphers, cryptomath is not my strong point, nor does it need to be). And also to see if so called claimed more experienced people here can solve this.

So the problem is called Poor man's OTP and it is as follows:

- A poor man has 256 truly random One Time Pads, of large length.. say more than 4096 bits: o1, o2, .., o256.
- He wishes to encrypt 1024 bit long piece of plain text p, with a strong 256 bit private key k.
- He computes the poor man's OTP O follows: for each otp o_i, he XORs o_i with the current O if and only if the i-th bit of the key is 1. Basically, the key chooses one of 2^256 subsets of the set of otps, and XORs it's members together.
- He then XORs O with p and claims it is secure.

Let's brute force this under the most common and useful scenario: known plain text attack.

To brute force this, one would have to check each of 2^256 subsets since each yields a different OTP.

But I am pretty convinced I can do it in like 2*256^3 so like 2^25. Can you? Remeber, the key is that the otps are chosen truly randomly.

After a while with this post around, I will also post my solution.

Best,

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Reddit,crypto,Symmetric key exchange protocol,2024-09-07 17:55:12,"Hi folks,

I was trying to fill in the gap for use case for SKREM-like ciphers I posted about (which I invented and got peer reviewed in 2021). It's of course a symmetric key cipher. The only major thing lacking is bilateral key exchange over a public channel. Monkey in the middle I can prevent with Lamport-like digital signing.

So I was wondering if we can do any better than Meet in the Middle key exchange.

I think we can.. and I got this idea, based on There Pass Protocol.

1. Alice picks a truly random large master table g of size n bits (say 1 GB long). She also chooses truly randomly a permutation p of n elements, consisting of a single cycle of length n.
2. Alice sends Bob the master g table with the bits permuted by p.
3. Bob receives and further permutes by a permutation q also of n elements consisting of a single cycle of length n.
4. Bob sends to Alice the result.
5. Alice applies p^-1 to the message from Bob and sends to Bob.
6. Bob receives second message from Alice and applies q^-1.

Now both Bob and Alice have the same info on master table g. This is since such permutations comute.

Potentially, it can be combined with Meet in the Middle Key exchange, by encrypting  step 5 with the short key obtained by MIM KE.

Note that permutations are not themselves sent but just their application to the large GMT.

This looks pretty cool and maybe quite secure to me.. am I missing something? Why is this not in literature? Or is it?

Thanks!

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 18:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

Feel free to share your attempts and findings!

Originally I was told to refer to the Intel Manuals to learn more about cryptographic hardware extensions.

However I admit I have no experience in hardware RTL designs nor assembly. Plus Intel CPUs are proprietary and I can't just make edits to them without risking lawsuits (or worse). So I decided to pay attention to the RISC-V Cryptographic Hardware Extensions--which are open source.

Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 11:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 16:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code.

Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Even if the code is flawed, as long as your team-mates can refactor the code the code that is legible but flawed will eventually be improved and outshine the original code that is correct **but** illegible.

Reddit,crypto,Most Used Languages to Program Cryptography in Production?,2024-07-25 05:04:31,"Hello Everyone.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 16:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180

Reddit,crypto,What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,2024-07-21 12:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;

Reddit,crypto,Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,2024-07-19 13:24:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180
Reddit,crypto,Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,2024-07-19 05:22:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

https://preview.redd.it/6j48x6a1redd1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f10d930771d9ea0147e8ccb5342d551e4942b7

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377)

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)? T(tau) is required for generate the CRS which helps compute the commitment of H.T - this is that part of the CRS -  (tau^i * t(tau))/delta}_{i=0 to n-2}. T depends on number of gates in the circuit - i.e. T(tau) changes if now of gates in the circuit changes.",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180
Reddit,crypto,Most Effective Methods to Test if Crypto Code is Constant-Time?,2024-07-18 22:54:55,"In a previous blog post I was told to benchmark my cryptographic code to test if it is constant time.

I was considering ctgrind and other tools from [this paper.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1650.pdf) How accurate are these tools at detecting constant-time flaws in code? Do you recommend I use a combination of tools if so? When I should conduct real lab experiments to test if the code is truly constant-time?

  
Please let me know.

Thanks!",2024-09-13 00:47:59.792180
