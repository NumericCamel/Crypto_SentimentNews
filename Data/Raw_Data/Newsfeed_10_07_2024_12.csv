The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) fresh appeal in its continuous action against Ripple is driving the price drop. Investors are left wondering about XRP’s future as the legal question of whether it qualifies as a security looms over the token like a dark cloud. Related Reading: Starknet: Long Positions Liquidated Lead To 16% Losses Hope is mixed with skepticism, as some analysts are nearly optimistic about recovery, considering the dire forecast. Indeed, there have been whale activities identified through recent data from the Whale Alert platform, monitoring large cryptos transfers. 🚨 30,380,000 #XRP (15,993,939 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitsohttps://t.co/NWSMKsIZJy — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 3, 2024 Over the past 24 hours, 153 million XRP tokens were transferred and some of them, undoubtedly, to the exchanges. This has elicited some interest on the side of traders about future prospects for XRP, though the token’s future leans considerably on the outcome in court with the SEC. 🚨 19,220,000 #XRP (10,122,908 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Bitstamphttps://t.co/GNObmOWzeZ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 3, 2024 Whales Are Migrating XRP Whale Alert reports that a whale wallet transferred over 30 million XRP tokens equivalent to almost $16 million into the Bitso exchange. Such activity on part of whales is usually deemed to be a precursor where traders are either bracing for more losses or are seeking profits. Everyone keeps guessing whether this spate of activity from whales bodes well for another leg down of XRP ahead of the SEC appeal. 🚨 🚨 🚨 104,384,848 #XRP (54,662,653 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/ggwKSmRD9z — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 3, 2024 In spite of these substantial token transfers, there are those who anticipate that XRP may experience a rebound. Jack The Rippler, a renowned crypto analyst, identified a historical descending triangle pattern on the one-month chart of XRP. This pattern implies that the token may be consolidating prior to a potential breakout. In 2016 and 2020, comparable patterns resulted in precipitous rallies following the breach of resistance levels, providing optimism to those anticipating an additional increase in the price of XRP.

XRP is currently at a juncture from a technical standpoint. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 39, a value that suggests bearish momentum. Typically, an RSI below 50 indicates that the asset is under pressure, and if it falls below 30, it may enter oversold territory. However, the analysis from Jack The Rippler reveals that XRP might break out of its current trend since this is the case after a similar consolidation in the past. Analysts expect that this token might continue its pursuit of the next resistance level if such is the case. Meanwhile, the SEC lawsuit is the elephant in the room, though, and cannot be ignored either. The result of this court struggle will significantly affect XRP’s next action. Should the SEC be successful in showing that Ripple’s secondary XRP sales broke US securities rules, the token may suffer more losses; some analysts predict a sharp decrease from its present price to $0.11.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Crypto Analyst: Why Memecoins Are Still The Next 100x Opportunity,2024-10-07 09:30:11+00:00,"Over the past weekend, there was a notable rise in memecoin prices, driven by heightened social buzz and increased risk appetite among crypto investors. The concept of a “memecoin supercycle,” which posits that memecoins will lead the upcoming crypto bull run, gained traction on X. In this context, crypto analyst Kai (@Kaiwen0x) released a widely-shared article explaining the ongoing allure of memecoins as a viable investment choice. The Case For Memecoins In The Crypto Bull Run 2025 Kai argues that memecoins are poised to outperform the market by 2025, suggesting that owning a “curated basket of memecoins” could allow investors to surpass 99% of market participants. “Outside of Bitcoin and stablecoins, memecoin is the only category that has found a clear product-market fit. They combine the best features of an ICO (capital formation) and an NFT (community building) in delivering a killer product: global, permissionless speculation,” he states. The analyst emphasizes that traditional crypto projects often juggle both product development and token management, whereas memecoins focus solely on the token itself. “Memecoins removed the product and made the token its entire business, with the value of the token deriving from the attention generated by its community,” Kai explains. Citing data from crypto analyst @MustStopMurad, Kai notes that in 2024, 16 of the top 20 tokens within the top 300 that outperformed Bitcoin were memecoins. Related Reading: RIP Altcoin Seasons? Crypto Analyst Debates Whether They’ll Ever Return Kai identifies two main external factors which are crucial for a memecoin surge. First, the macro liquidity and interest rates need to be favorable for the entire market: “The macro setup points to higher liquidity and lower interest rates in the next 12 months. Memecoins act as levered beta on Bitcoin, allowing you to capture maximum upside in a risk-on environment,” Kai explains. Second, the analyst references financial nihilism, a term popularized by Ikigai Investment CEO Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling). This theory suggests that a rise in financial nihilism and the “YOLO” mindset is drawing more participants into speculative markets. Internally, memecoins have shown they possess a clear product-market fit and benefit from what is known as the Lindy effect—where the future life expectancy of some technologies or ideas is proportional to their current age, suggesting that memecoins are here to stay. Additionally, memecoins are particularly adept at creating and maintaining compelling narratives, a critical aspect in a market driven by speculation and investor sentiment. The Art Of Memecoin Selection Kai delves into strategies for selecting promising memecoins, emphasizing the importance of nuanced analysis: Emotional Resonance: “I’m looking for memes that generate a strong emotional reaction. Is it funny, relatable, catchy, powerful, or memorable? The average retail investor is going to be the last marginal bidder of our magic internet coins, so you need to buy and hold what they emotionally resonate with,” Kai explains. Ticker Simplicity: Favoring simple and powerful tickers, ideally 3 to 5 letters long, such as WIF, GIGA, and BULL. Holder Count Growth: Monitoring steady growth in the number of holders as an indicator of increasing adoption. Wide Token Distribution: Preferring coins with broad distribution to avoid centralization risks. Resilience to Drawdowns: Identifying coins that have survived multiple significant price drops and rebounded, indicating strong community support. Active Community Engagement: Looking for an “active army of reply guys getting engagements on X,” which signals a vibrant and engaged community. Exchange Listings: Noting that announcements of centralized exchange (CEX) listings can significantly impact a token’s valuation. Absence of Insiders: Being cautious of coins with insider involvement, such as pre-sales or venture capital backing, which can lead to uneven playing fields. Potential Risks and Invalidation Scenarios Kai acknowledges the risks associated with investing in memecoins: Macro Regime Change: A significant rebound in inflation or a reversal of monetary easing could invalidate the macro thesis for being long on risk assets. Idiosyncratic Events: Events like major exchange hacks, regulatory shifts, or significant market collapses could disproportionately affect memecoins. US Election Outcomes: “Counterintuitively, memecoins could underperform this cycle if Trump wins the election,” Kai speculates. Emotional Attachment: He cautions against becoming too emotionally invested in any one community, as this can cloud judgment. “Identity can create emotional ties that cloud your judgment as an investor.” Related Reading: Crypto Guru Warns: Only 6 Years Left To ‘Make As Much Money As Possible’ Kai emphasizes the importance of understanding investor psychology in the crypto market. “Ultimately, the question returns to: ‘What does the average crypto investor actually care about?’ It’s not the tech. It’s not the product. It’s the token—embodying greed and the expectation of greater profit—that ultimately consumes this investor,” he writes. However, the crypto analyst advises investors to remain vigilant and adaptable: “To avoid getting wrecked, we need to monitor macro conditions for any signs of a regime shift. We must also keep an eye on idiosyncratic events that could invalidate the thesis for investing in any specific token.” Kai concludes, “Good luck, and for the love of dogs, don’t mid-curve this (still) 100x opportunity.” At press time, WIF traded at $2.67.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year",2024-10-07 08:00:20+00:00,"Crypto analyst Ash Crypto has outlined several reasons why the Bitcoin price is poised to reach $100,000 by the end of the year. This price level is one that other market experts like Standard Chartered have predicted that the flagship crypto could hit even before year-end.  Why The Bitcoin Price Can Reach $100,000 By Year-End Ash Crypto stated in an X post that the answer to whether Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in the fourth quarter of this year lies in the past halving cycles. He noted that BTC usually goes through a consolidation phase of around six months after each halving. In 2016, the flagship crypto is said to have witnessed 161 days of consolidation before a price breakout. Meanwhile, in 2020, Bitcoin recorded 175 days of consolidation before its price broke out.  Related Reading: ‘FLOKI Master Plan’: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2,000% Jump For The Shiba Inu Competitor In line with this, Ash Crypto noted that the flagship crypto has consolidated for 161 days since the Halving event in April earlier this year. Therefore, the analyst claimed that there is a high probability that the Bitcoin price could witness a breakout in the next two to three weeks. He then went on to outline fundamentals that could spark this price breakout.  Firstly, Ash Crypto stated that China is printing $280 billion to boost its economy. This is about the People Bank of China’s announcement of a stimulus package to help revive the country’s economy. China’s monetary easing policies have been bullish for Bitcoin, historically leading to price surges for the flagship crypto.   Furthermore, the analyst noted that the US Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates. The Fed announced a 50 basis points (bps) rate cut at its September FOMC meeting. There are also expectations that there could be another 50 bps rate cut before the year ends. This is also bullish for the Bitcoin price since more liquidity could flow into the flagship crypto with US investors having access to more capital.  Another macro factor that the analyst cited is the fact that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) looks to have turned dovish and is, in the meantime, no longer considering rate hikes. The Bitcoin price crashed below $50,000 in the infamous August 5 crypto market following the BOJ’s decision to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years.  Therefore, the BOJ’s decision not to hike rates further is positive for Bitcoin. Doing otherwise could revive the ghosts of the yen carry trade as Japanese investors liquidate their positions in risk assets like BTC.  Other Factors That Could Spark The Rise To $100,000 Ash Crypto also listed other factors that could help the Bitcoin price reach $100,000. The analyst noted that Donald Trump is again leading in the opinion polls and looks likely to win the US presidential elections in November. A Trump victory is considered a win for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market because the former US President has declared his support for cryptocurrencies.  Related Reading: 72% Of ETHUSDT Traders On Binance Go Long – Is This The Buy Signal You Need? The analyst also cited the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have started to accumulate again. The Bitcoin flow to exchange has also reached a very low level, which indicates that investors are choosing to hold for the long term, meaning less selling pressure. FTX customers are also expected to receive their repayments this quarter, which could cause more liquidity to flow into Bitcoin.   Lastly, Russia plans to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for cross-border payments starting in November, while the global money supply has reached new highs. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is currently bullish. Interestingly, Ash Crypto claimed that the crypto market has still not factored in all these bullish fundamentals. He stated that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high (ATH) when that happens.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

The unexpected movement caused the token to fall by nearly 16% causing a whopping $87k wipeout of STRK long positions in the past 24 hours.  Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? The market’s current positioning puts many investors at risk with big losses for the bulls if investor sentiment does not flip bullish in the coming days. With no solid backing for a bull run this week, STRK starts weakly as investors continue to be cautious of the market’s volatility.  Surprise For Investors Despite the market’s bearishness, STRK bulls pulled a small win in the shape of a localized breakthrough on the $0.3891 resistance level which might translate to big gains in the coming days. However, this can only occur if the token stabilizes above $0.3891 in the short to medium term.  With the token possibly entering a crucial crossover point hinted at by STRK’s relative strength index, a bullish reversal might be around the corner for investors. But this may only come if the market flips on the side of the bulls.  As of writing, Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency in the world, is currently moving in the same zone as well.  The broader financial market’s current bullishness might leak to the crypto market through Bitcoin’s correlation with major finance indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones index, both are up a few hundred points in the past 24 hours.  But with investors split between investing or pulling out of the market, it might take a while before STRK experiences a jump in price that will wipe out last week’s losses. For the current losses to be completely reversed, the token needs to attempt a breakthrough on the $0.5083 resistance level.  However, STRK’s current trajectory may only permit a move above the $0.3891 support level. Once the token stabilizes on this support level, STRK bulls might find new strength, targeting $0.4628 in the medium to long term.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Shoots Up 1,000% – Are New ATH Levels Just Around The Corner?

However, investors should not expect much from the current implementation of decentralization as the timeline for this is not yet defined and will undoubtedly take some time to implement.  Featured image from Medium, chart from TradingView",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge?,2024-10-06 17:00:27+00:00,"Bittensor (TAO) has been garnering attention for its exceptional performance, surpassing Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. TAO has experienced a 15% increase in the past 24 hours, and it has appreciated by over 130% in the past 30 days. This extraordinary expansion has established TAO as one of the most successful altcoins, attracting the attention of both institutional and retail investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Shoots Up 1,000% – Are New ATH Levels Just Around The Corner? The altcoin’s future potential is a significant factor in the development of this momentum. Recent price predictions show that Bittensor could experience a substantial 220% increase, with a potential price of $1,800 by November 2024. Many are interpreting the current bullish sentiment as an opportunity to purchase TAO before it experiences its next significant surge. Open Interest Reaches New Highs According to Coinglass, TAO’s Open Interest, which recently reached an all-time high of $189 million, is one of the most telling indicators of its strength. That’s sharply up from $50 million recorded at the start of September. An increasing Open Interest-the total number of active positions held by traders is often a very positive sign, as it indicates more money is being invested in the asset. This surge in Open Interest alongside rising TAO price signifies that the traders are not just holding on to their existing long positions but are also actively buying new ones. Therefore, upward momentum means that the recent runs of Bittensor may be sustained for some time longer. This has heightened speculations that the token may even ascend much higher. Technical Analysis Supports The Bullish Hunch Bittensor is now trading at $554, representing a critical resistance. TAO plots a V-shaped recovery on the four-hour chart, which usually represents sustained positive momentum. The CMF indicator has also stayed positive at 0.21, showing significant buying force in the market. Besides this positive forecast, a green volume histogram bar shows that TAO may be able to break up from this resistance line to the next point at $618. Considering the strength of purchasing volume by the market, a short-term upward movement can be said to hold a good case. Related Reading: Market Signals Hint At Bitcoin’s Potential Fall To $52,000—Analyst What Lies Ahead For Bittensor Analysts are generally positive about Bittensor’s future. Even though the cryptocurrency market as a whole is still pretty sketchy, TAO has had 20 “green days” out of the last 30 days, which means that 67% of the time, prices have gone up. The coin is growing, even though it has a 30% fluctuation, and predictions for November 2024 show that it will grow a lot.

As of writing, the token has lost over 20% in value, representing a massive flip in investor sentiment. The market has not been faring any better as it lost nearly 2% in value, wiping nearly $800 million in market cap in the past 24 hours.  Related Reading: Market Signals Hint At Bitcoin’s Potential Fall To $52,000—Analyst Lido’s development persists despite the market’s apparent bearishness, the most recent of which might drive retail interest on the platform sky-high. However, with the market acting as a chaotic background for LDO, it might come later than what investors and traders expect.  Lido DAO Announces Community Staking Early Adoption Program Yesterday, October 5, Lido’s official X account announced the Community Staking Module (CSM) Early Adoption program designed specifically for solo stakers who want to taste the CSM environment before its initial launch. Introducing the Community Staking Module Early Adoption Program: A Unique Opportunity for Solo Stakers 🌐 Eligible operators can benefit from: 1️⃣ Early access to the CSM mainnet, avoiding competition from large staking entities for ETH allocations. 2️⃣ A reduced requirement of… pic.twitter.com/x6N8oINq9l — Lido (@LidoFinance) October 4, 2024 According to the X post, stakers eligible for the program can enjoy early access to the CSM mainnet, a reduced capital requirement from 32 ETH to just 1.5 ETH, and a potential 2.37x higher reward per ETH.  In addition to these benefits, eligible operators are also allowed to run 12 validators. According to Lido’s blog post, the limit will only be lifted after the early adoption phase.  To ensure that only solo stakers will have the opportunity to enter the program, Lido has put out specific filtration rules that will check each applicant if they are eligible for the program.  This development will ultimately stimulate retail interest in the platform as it lowers the economic barrier to participating in the network. However, its strict rules regarding the eligibility of community members and network users to be part of the CSM Early Adoption Program hinder any potential gain in the long-term of the network as only a handful of users can participate in the reduced financial burden brought by the program. $0.88-$1.13 Range Holds Little Promise For LDO As of writing, the token is struggling to hold the weight of the bearish pressure that has overtaken the market by storm. LDO bulls do not have the same momentum as the bears which may lead to a short to medium-term continuation of the downward trajectory.  The token’s relative strength index, however, is hinting a possible reversal in the medium term timeframe which might lead to LDO keeping its current trading range in the next couple of days.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Shoots Up 1,000% – Are New ATH Levels Just Around The Corner? Investors and traders should monitor the broader market’s movement in the coming days as LDO’s correlation with the major cryptocurrencies will play a huge part in its future price movement.

Honestly I have a bit of experience in Crypto

But really break it down like I’m 15 years old with a bad case of Brain rot 

I want to know how and what are your criteria ans checks you would do to ascertain before “investing” in a Memecoin 

Eg. 

What online tools would you use (Solana only)

I know of Dex screener!

How would you look at who owns a large amount of the supply?

What percentage they own. 

And all the other relevant information you’d investigate and base your conclusions on

95% of the content is extractive, farming, shilling or spamming nonsense.  I dont like most of the KOLs, everyone is untrustworthy and more and more it appears to be a huge circlejerk among insiders.  

it got even worse when Elon started paying for impressions cuz now people just say and post anything

A lot of these kols arent nteresting enough to do content outside of their memecoin success, which is fine but its irritating when their cringe content gets pushed to the front because of the idea that somewhere somehow theres money on the table by giving attention to their posts.

Though I've set Devnet everywhere, I still get this Network mismatch error, where it says that the transaction is for mainnet. Now I did a bit of research and found out that it's a bug with Solflare and they are working on resolving it. So for the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't give users the option to connect Solflare wallet, but unfortunately I'm unable to do so. I have not included solflare wallet in my code:

      const wallets = useMemo(
        () => [
          new PhantomWalletAdapter(),
          new LedgerWalletAdapter(),
          new WalletConnectWalletAdapter(),
          new TorusWalletAdapter(),
          new MathWalletAdapter(),
        ],
        []
      );

But still the app shows Solflare wallet as option as it is already installed on my laptop. Is there any way to exclude Solflare wallet. I want to make sure that users only see the above wallets in the list to connect and no other wallet, irrespective of whether I've them installed or not.

Reddit,solana,Profiting from copy traders,2024-10-05 12:55:54,"I was just thinking if it theoretically would be possible to profit from copy traders.

Wouldn’t it be possible to track which wallet someone is copy trading then find a way to buy the coin before the copy trader is buying so that you can sell it for more after the copy trader has bought? 

The way I would manage to buy before the copy trader is to have my own custom bot that is faster than the one many copy traders are buying on telegram. I would assume that because those telegram bots are built for the mass and not for only one person that they’re slower. 

I have knowledge in Rust which is one of the fastest programming languages. And I could write such a bot in Rust.
I doubt that the telegram copy trading bots are also using rust, as it’s way simpler to create a telegram bot with something like NodeJS or Python. 

I could find wallets that are being copy traded by just checking who bought the same coin a few seconds later. My goal would be to buy the same coin after the wallet that’s being copy traded but before the copy trader buys. Then once the copy trader buys I would instantly sell it, which should turn it into a profit. 

I have never bought any copy trading bot so if anyone of you has, it would be great if you could share some info with me.

Do you think this possible? ",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Reddit,solana,What is the viability of implement smart contracts in day to day operations?,2024-10-04 21:39:05,"Hi all! 

I am a developer and I am currently hyper focused on blockchain and crypto environment, specially on the matters of Smart Contracts. 

I am very interested in how I believe smart contracts could disrupt a lot of fields, so I started digging into the development aspect of it. However, one thing that really got me worrying, is the transaction cost of these nets. 

Even solana, with one of the lowest fees, the cost seems pretty unreasonable to develop anything at scale. 

I imagine that there are a lot of workarounds developers do to minimize costs, so I wanted to get your opinion on how viable are these costs in terms of development in scale and what are some of the ways people often use to minimize costa and structure a smart contract, and use it in real life applications.

I am also interested in use cases where companies uses these public nets, but abstracts the usage of blockchain, in a way that the user would not need to worry about creating wallets, managing keys and withdrawing money. So any insights on that matter are also welcome! 

Thank you!

Update: Just to make myself clearer, I do think that for use cases such as transferring money from accounts, or any other applications where each user has a wallet and it’s well informed about transaction costs and deal with them by themselves, the taxes are way lower than traditional transfer methods. However my main point is that most of the people do not want or do not care about having a wallet, and they are not informed at all about tramsaction fees and crypto buying. In these cases, to reduce barrier of entries, one might think of a solution where a third-party (the app, let’s say so) is responsible for abstrancting all these things, which means that the app itself will do the transactions internally. That’s where I think the cost rise up pretty quickly.",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Here's more of the latest news for Solana devs...  


### 🏗️ Steel Framework

Steel is a new open-source framework developed by Regolith Labs (Ore) to simplify the development of programs on the Solana blockchain.

The framework originated out of a desire to streamline common tasks, reduce boilerplate code, and provide more efficient interfaces for Solana development.

Steel provides a collection of tools and helper functions to reduce the complexity of Solana program development by simplifying the handling of tasks like instruction parsing, cross-program invocations (CPIs), and account data validation.

It's a work in progress but already provides several tools aimed at improving the developer experience:

**Entrypoint Simplification:** Steel reduces the entrypoint boilerplate code by offering helper functions to parse instructions before dispatching to core logic, speeding up initial setup.

**Loaders for Account Data:** Steel includes loaders to parse and validate account data, which are expected to evolve to return mutable or readonly references to inner account data.

**Simplified CPIs:** Common CPIs such as creating token accounts, transferring, minting, and burning tokens are simplified, making interactions between programs easier and more efficient.

Features like initialization scripts, IDL generation, and a no-std-entrypoint for performance optimization are part of Steel's roadmap.

Steel encourages contributions from the Solana developer community to help it grow and evolve as more developers get involved.

### 🏙️ Jupiter Metropolis API

The Metropolis API Platform by Jupiter introduces a powerful set of liquidity tools designed to streamline access to liquidity on Solana.

The platform consists of three key APIs:

**Token API:** This API provides detailed token information, including enhanced token metadata and community-verified token tags. It serves as a reliable source of truth for developers and protocols, offering token data that users can trust when interacting with tokens.

**Price API (V2):** The second version of the Price API delivers enriched, real-time price data and historical swap information from Jupiter.

It includes features like Confidence Level, indicating the reliability of the price, especially useful for tokens with wide spreads, and Liquidity Depth, which shows available liquidity and potential price impacts on larger trades.

**Swap API:** Designed to facilitate seamless transactions, this API provides features such as Dynamic Slippage and Instant Routing. It helps developers access the best token swap prices and estimates priority fees for successful transaction completion.

Metropolis aims to simplify integration with Solana’s liquidity, empowering developers to build sustainable applications by providing real-time, accurate, and comprehensive liquidity data.

### 💳 Squads Card SDK

The Squads Card SDK leverages the programmability and security of Squads Protocol smart accounts, which power the self-custodial architecture behind [Fuse Pay](https://fusewallet.com/blog/fuse-pay?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a virtual Visa card that allows users to spend stablecoins in real-world transactions directly from their Fuse wallet.

When a user creates a card account, a separate smart account is deployed, with the main Fuse account acting as the signer. 

The SDK will allow other projects to easily integrate similar functionality, enabling them to launch card products on Solana with full user control, customizable spending limits, and time-locked withdrawals.

For developers, the Squads Card SDK opens up new opportunities to build card-based products that merge on-chain assets with everyday spending. 

Squads Protocol is actively seeking design partners to help shape the future of the Squads Card SDK. 

By participating in the design phase, developers can contribute to the SDK’s development, ensure it meets real-world needs, and take part in creating the next generation of Solana-based payment solutions.

Interested developers can reach out directly to the Squads team via DMs or participate in discussions on Solana developer forums.

[**Squads Card SDK Design Partners Wanted**](https://x.com/simkinstepan/status/1841049380096217259?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  


### ⛓️ Wormhole Era3

**Wormhole Era3** brings upgrades to enhance cross-chain interoperability and improve UX, offering Solana developers new features to build on.

1. **Composable Intents**: Developers can chain multiple cross-chain actions into a single transaction, allowing for seamless asset swaps, DeFi operations, and other complex tasks across multiple blockchains, including Solana.
2. **Native Token Transfers (NTT)**: A new framework that eliminates liquidity fragmentation by preserving the native properties of tokens during transfers, meaning assets maintain their intrinsic qualities when moved across chains without needing to be wrapped. This ensures secure and fluid token movement for projects and financial institutions building on Solana.
3. **Enhanced SDKs**: The Wormhole TypeScript SDK has been revamped, making it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications with advanced UI/UX capabilities.
4. **Institutional Integrations**: Wormhole's new offerings cater to institutional needs, enabling Solana developers to build applications that align with capital markets and RWAs, as seen with partnerships like Securitize and integrations with Google Cloud and AMD.

These improvements in Era3 provide Solana developers tools for building multichain dApps while ensuring security and flexibility.

### 🔒 Hypernative on Solana

Solana projects now have access to Hypernative's platform, including a dedicated risk dashboard and incident response support to enhance security for Solana’s developer ecosystem.

Hypernative’s platform monitors a wide range of risks, including program vulnerabilities, phishing, scams, and market manipulations, offering real-time threat detection and response for both the network and projects building on it. 

Solana is now among more than 130 Web3 projects that utilize Hypernative's enterprise-grade platform, which monitors over $37 billion in digital assets across 40+ blockchains.

Developers building or managing funds on Solana can request a demo of Hypernative’s platform.

I'm experimenting with some trading strategies and I noticed that whenever I submit a transaction it takes somewhere close to 15-ish seconds. The fastest one I managed to see so far was 7 seconds. Is that expected? What are some best practices for performing fast transactions?

I know, sometimes the network gets congested but even when it's not this is still a problem. 

I tried using the public mainnet RPC as well as some free tier RPC nodes from Alchemy and Quiknode and the results are about the same. I also tried to increase the priority fee, which, imo, doesn't make much difference. 

I saw some traders performing sandwhiching, where they manage to pack 2 transactions into one block having a single transaction in between. Is that only possible with running a private RPC node or a Validator? ",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

As always, the effectiveness (speed) of the sniper depends on which RPC you are using, you can configure a public one (not recommended), or the one you have or simply use Smithii's premium RPC (fast node).

I recently ran it for four hours with 0.1 SOL for the buying amount and made a 100% profit (10 buy/sell cycles - 2 nonprofitable). My settings were 30% take profit, 20% SL, 40% slippage and the only active filter was burn LP, all other settings were default.

Also, I’m curious about the risk that one assumes when launching a coin. Do these rug pullers have any risk or serious overhead costs? I see there are plenty of cheap easy ways to launch new shitcoins.  If you’re pumping your own coin on launch (on DexScreener Moonshot, for example) but no one is buying, I assume that would mean that there’s no real liquidity. If no one is there to buy, then the SOL you pumped into your new coin disappears because there’s no one to dump to. Am I correct in my assessment? I’ve always traded bigger coins with huge caps and plenty liquidity. I’ve never understood the concept of a startup coin. Maybe I’m missing fundamental knowledge of how the market works. My ROI% is a solid -40% so far. Small sample size but most of it was due to rug pulls within 8 hrs of a coin’s launch.
Any insight or resource is greatly appreciated. Ty  ",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

I did some sleuthing in my wallet as this thing is in my wallet too.: but then i saw other addresses too that,have also sent me 0.000001 sol. I looked o
into those and:
THOSE ARE ADRESS POISONING SCAMS.

I dont know how it exactly enters my wallet but what it does is this:

It sends 0.000001 sol to your wallet after you interact with a TRUSTED address. 
And when you look at the SENDER address, it ALMOST looks EXACTLY like the address you used to do a legitimate transaction to/with.

Example: you have 2 wallets. 
Wallet 1 is called  ABC1....9XYZ

You send 1 sol from wallet 1 to wallet 2.

Then the scambot immediately sends 0.000001 sol 
to wallet 2 .
When you look in wallet 2, you see the transaction of what wallet 1 has sent (legitimate)
PLUS you will see OTHER transaction of what the SCAMBOT has sent you.
When you look at the scambot/sender address, you will notice that THE ADDRESS IS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE LEGITIMATE ADDRESS 

        Wallet 1   (SAFE)  ABC1....9XYZ

other sender        (SCAM)  ABOI... PXYZ

another send        (SCAM) ABCi....gXYZ

CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE A POISONING SCAM ATTEMPT. when you do not pay attention you could EASILY copy the WRONG address to send your funds to.

It sends you transactions from addresses that look like the ones you trust and interacted with in the past.
It does this immediately. I made a fresh wallet and sent 1 sol to it, As soon as i received my 1 sol there were THREE OTHER sends of 0.00001 sol from addresses that looks ALMOST IDENTICAL.

Reddit,solana,World record egg big rug ,2024-10-02 05:36:01,"Hey everyone,

I want to shed light on a recent scam involving the World Record Egg Instagram account — you know, the one famous for having the most-liked post ever.

The account was recently acquired by a new team, but instead of just riding on its popularity, they decided to use it for launching several Solana-based cryptocurrency projects. Their end goal? Draining investor funds using shady tactics, like controlling the majority of the token supply and dumping large amounts (150k, 50k $SOL) repeatedly, which resulted in a Rug Pull and left many investors at a huge loss.

What happened:

	•	Leveraged the World Record Egg brand to build credibility.
	•	Launched three separate tokens.
	•	Manipulated the supply, dumped tokens at a high price, and caused the value to crash while cashing out with millions.
	•	Complete lack of transparency regarding the real people behind the new projects.

What you can do:

	1.	Report this scam wherever you see them promoting their projects.
	2.	Stay vigilant if you follow the account, and don’t get lured in by investment promises.
	3.	Share this post to spread the word so others don’t fall for it.

If you or anyone you know has been affected, feel free to reach out. I’m trying to gather as many victims as possible to escalate this issue and hand over a complete report to the financial authorities.

Stay safe and protect your investments!

Reddit,ethereum,"When using Groth16 on Ethereum through ᴇɪᴘ‒197, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-05 21:22:04,"First remember Ethereum only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result… Otherwise I recognize this is more a mathematical problem but the place where I’m the most likely to find someone who do understand it remains on Ethereum as it’s partly cryptocurrency math specific.

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The trusted setup publishes

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money. I don’t know what I’m gonna do from there, I’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and I was supposed to go to University next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone. I’m really at a point where I want to give up on life.

-throwaway account, I’m truly ashamed of myself

EDIT: I will try to take legal actions but I really don't expect anything, as for the people saying I should have had a hardware wallet, I know. I also saw a lot of people claiming I was rich which is hilarious, I'm an immigrant from Senegal to Canada my parents are middle class workers (Accountant and Oceanographer) that struggled to give us good life opportunities so yes $45K is a lot of money. This is a part of the money I've invested being a video editor and held in ETH since 2-3 years, I'm not rich. Thank you for everyone sending me nice words of support, I needed that.

EDIT 2: I bought a Ledger wallet to stock the BTC I had on another hot wallet, I’m not making the same mistake again. I want to thank you guys again for the nice/wise words my brothers and sisters, it has helped cope a bit better with my situation although I still feel horrible about the whole thing. As for the ETH it’s gone, I don’t think I’ll ever see it again and although I still have a bit of money left, I’ll have to make it all over again but as some of you guys said I’ve done it once I can do it again and better.",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/33gtnpdf7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=42da675ea3e71c74f71a7b294b547888e8219be3

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

🔗 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Reddit,ethereum,"When using the ᴇɪᴘ‑197 precompile, is there a risk of forgery when allowing the degeneracy of bilinear pairings when using Groth16 with public inputs ? If not, how to rework the Groth16 protocol in order to let verifier ditching a pairing e(C,vk) when calling the precompile as a gas saving measure ?",2024-09-29 13:08:58,"The non degeneracy criteria is there’s no bilinear pairing resulting in the finite field element 1 equivalent.

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

But what would happen if it would be the cases as it’s happening on some implementation that use the Ethereum’s ᴇɪᴘ‐197 precompile ? There are clear examples on how to forge proofs when there’s no public inputs or they are allowed to be all 0 but are there security risk when public inputs are used and if yes how this can be done ?",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

Reddit,ethereum,Account Abstraction: Crypto Beyond Private Keys,2024-09-18 14:46:04,"Chances are, you have come across the term “account abstraction,” but you don’t know what it means. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cio8hwgfxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20a3703848b92783e55ea0dfd73e806dba78490

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/iegallxsxkpd1.png?width=2751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb0b8618ebf50cb583ad8fddacc7bedd411d7b3

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Reddit,ethereum,Can KYC Add Security Without Compromising Decentralization? 🤔 ,2024-09-16 19:18:52,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

Reddit,bitcoin,The Gravity of Bitcoin: Unstoppable and Unbanable,2024-10-06 18:43:19,"In the crypto space, losing money is the price of tuition. I played with leverage and lost money on speculative assets. Many people, including myself, come to make money. Some gamble and strike it big, but most eventually lose everything. Those who avoid ending up broken and bitter are the ones who research projects, build convictions around them, and become community builders and utility creators. Alternatively (quite often additionally), they genuinely understand Bitcoin.


The key difference between Bitcoin and other cryptos is that most projects are companies, whereas Bitcoin is a protocol. If something negative happens to Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, their respective company’s stocks will plummet. Bitcoin, however, has no such vulnerability. The inventor has disappeared. 


“Satoshi created a way, gave it away, and walked away”

-Michael Saylor 


There is no figurehead to target, no single person to sanction or slander. It's akin to attacking gravity – impossible. You can't ban Bitcoin; you can only ban yourself from it. Gravity doesn't require trust because it's a fundamental protocol of nature. When you drop something, its weight is verified. Similarly, Bitcoin's value is verifiable, making trust unnecessary. 

Bitcoin invites us to look beyond speculation and build conviction on its unshakeable foundation. The gravity of truth holds: verifiable, trustless, and unassailable. Rise above the noise and trust the protocol.

Reddit,bitcoin,Guidance on taking profits,2024-10-07 12:15:08,"Hi,

I don’t have a lot of savings overall, but some of what I have is in BTC and has gotten to a point I would like to potentially take a little out to handle some expenses. 

I’m in the US and mostly purchased via Coinbase, but also have Gemini and Binance US accounts as there were a couple alts at the time I foolishly chased that were not available on CB.

My funds are on hardware wallets now. If I wanted to take a little out next bull run to handle some life expenses- what is the best approach to pay what I need in fees and taxes to stay legal but not more.  If I transfer it back to Coinbase they have fees to convert BTC back to fiat, then pay capital gains tax using FIFO is that all their is to it?

I’ve been using Cointracker and Koinly but neither are 100% accurate as when I was younger and goofing around when I was like 16-17 I bought a bunch of alts that went nowhere, got scammed a few times along the way, lost money in Celsius and BlockFi that each paid back via PayPal, bought a couple small things online with BTC just to see if I could, did a little mining from my laptop, straight up screwed up and lost BTC while learning how it all works— essentially a big mess.  Past couple years I used those apps to kinda guesstimate what to pay in taxes but know they are not 100%.  It was under the idea of “just do your best to figure it out and pay something” to keep the IRS from putting a microscope on you. 

So I am trying to pay due tax when I take a little out, and figured worse case scenario I should do fifo from here out just in case and pay max tax so if ever audited I won’t someday get spanked with a big past due tax bill of in trouble of any kind tax wise.  That said, I got a smidge early like 2017 when I was just a kid experimenting and it’s worth a decent amount more now and paying tax on that gain kinda sucks so just want to make sure I’m not missing the boat and doing this foolishly in a way that I’m leaving too much $ on the table.  

What is the lower cost legal way to DCA out a smidge here and there along the way?  Or is my plan to transfer back to Coinbase and just pay the tax on the gains based on what koinly says ok despite it not being 100% accurate?

If the IRS ever wants to audit me I’d like to be in a position to say I did everything I could to pay what I thought was right and not be screwed.  Not looking to be a target.

Thanks all

I’m just looking for perspective. If Michael Saylor prediction is true, I feel like starting a business isn’t needed given the enormous upfront capital and risks I need to take to establish a successful business. Investing into Bitcoin is risky too and does require a large capital but it’s been giving me better ROI compared to my online business where profit margins are low and I need to put more money into the product I’m selling. Building a profitable business takes years too.

Reddit,bitcoin,BTC Long Term,2024-10-07 01:23:34,"I was privy to a private event where Jeff Booth spoke recently and he made some interesting points I thought worthy of note. 

1. BTC as a store of value - he believes BTC cannot simply remain as a store of value. if everyone simply relies on it to go up in value and use it to create big gains it will fail. we have to transact in it and use it as an alternative to cash/money. Using it to make money and as a derivative as in shorts/longs/ loans/yields etc will result in failure. 

2. ETF’s will get confiscated - if governments try to use it as a reserve currency won’t work. Will result in ETF’s being confiscated like gold before it. And as in the past it would be used to prop up the currency until no longer enough, which would result in long term price suppression that would hurt BTC long term. 

I’m too smooth brained to give the full detail is on all this but would love to hear people’s thoughts on this. Made a lot of sense tho for sure.

Reddit,bitcoin,Side Gigs for stacking Sats,2024-10-05 12:47:01,"Exactly five days ago, I asked in this Reddit about more possibilities to sack sats than to go to work at our FIAT mines.

Now I have my four winners:

1) Get on Nostr. It is a social media platform and by providing value (comments, photos, even memes) you will get zapped Satoshis. Please be a part of the community and zap also back, it is like an upvote at Reddit!

2) Ember. It is an app (Apple & Google Store) where you can mine together with your friends and contacts. I make currently something like 15-20 Sats an hour(!) by only investing about 10 minutes a day. I have a referral in case you want a kickstart (+10 sats/hr) over there. 

3) Fountain App for podcast listening. There are great podcasts over there about Bitcoin, politics, but you can also listen to your standard Apple Podcast / Spotify podcasts over there. Every day you will get a few sats for listening! No brainer 🧡

4) THNDR Games. They have a few mini games (Bitcoin Snake, Tetris) where you can play a little and get Sats every hour. It is not much, I usually get for one game of Snake which takes maybe 2 minutes like 4 sats. Payout is every hour and it is connected to Wallets like Strike, Primal and Wallet of Satoshi, so it is super intuitive. I have made here maybe 100-200 sats and play from time to time just for fun.

If you know any more, I’d be happy to hear your recommendations! Keep stacking guys!

Reddit,bitcoin,Studying Comptia Security+. Presently studying cryptographic algorithms and the history of cryptography. I feel like the quantum treat is at least 20 years away.,2024-10-05 16:26:25,"Please take what I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm not a dev, nor a coder. I'm simply studying for something that can bolster my career moving forward.               

Doing a brief search on the world's first invented cryptographic algorithm, known as ""Data Encryption Standard"", it was invented in the 1970s. It was broken by a brute force attack in 1997 that took 56 hours to complete. There were attempts to extend the usefulness of DES by (my own words, no one elses) tripling the number of times it encrypts and re-encrypts information. DES was 56-bit encryption. ""Triple DES"" was essentially 111 bit encryption.               

At this point, organizations came together to formulate a new encryption standard and created a cryptographic algorithm for web browsing and information sharing that almost everyone uses today known as ""Advanced Encryption Standard"" (AES).            

My postulation is that, given the timeline between the introduction of DES to the time it was cracked, and given the introduction of quantum computers and that they are presently very weak (not to mention the fact that the components need to operate at nearly absolute zero (literally -273 degrees celsius (-460 degrees farenheit))), I view the quantum threat to Sha-256 as null now, and needing at least 20 years of development to break sha-256. Further, for perspective, to construct a quantum computer that could do this in today's numbers, the computer would need to be the size of a football field.            

**All of the difficulties associated with breaking SHA-256 placed to the side, would it be possible to use a soft-fork similar to speedy trial back in 2021 to move to a new hashing algorithm?**",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Not sure if the numbers below would be optimal but hopefully you get the idea.

Citizens that donate 100,000 sats to the national bitcoin strategic reserve, state Bitcoin reserve, or a local community Bitcoin reserve, will receive a $500.00 tax credit. 

This would give people an immediate reason to at least get off zero and hopefully start learning about Bitcoin.

We have a Spanish bank account so the Euros will be dropped in there at sale. I was wondering the best approach to avoid crazy fees and taxes that are coming our way. If it were up to me, I’d put it all in Bitcoin :) Is that even possible? How would I move all that to my cold wallet? If so how much in fees would it be to do that?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Binance - excessive facial recogntion requirement to login every time. Please stop it!,2024-10-06 17:45:30,"Would have posted in /r/binance but they made that sub private (great decision, sends all the right messages about Binance ...)

Lately Binance requests an automated Facial recognition as part of every login, at least in my case -- a Passkey as 2fa is no longer sufficient, it always wants at least 2 or 3 forms of 2fa and one of them is an automated Facial recognition, and it's mandatory.

If anyone from Binance sees this: please stop this nonsense! It keeps me out ... a person can grow facial fair, have swollen parts of the face from a disease, or from aggression, etc ... a host of valid reasons why a facial recognition no longer matches via automated matching!

I really hope otrher exchanges don't start with this nonsense too ... what's next? send over blood samples for DNA matching?

Edits:

1: To people who claim it's geo related: It never required facial recognition until a few weeks ago. My IP or location didn't change. My device hasn't changed (mobile). Apparently this facial recognition has started rolling out only a couple of months back.

2: To people claiming many banks and exchanges use facial recognition **for login**: which ones exactly? I've never seen or heard of any, apart from Binance. We're talking login, not KYC.

3: To people claiming facial changes aren't an issue becasue ""these systems are well designed"": clearly you haven't been hit by it, so why do you even reply?

4: To people claiming I must have done shady stuff: you guys never cease to get a kick out of acting mean, take it elsewhere.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Spent $1600 and 2 months doing CopyTrading, these are the results:",2024-10-05 20:41:05,"Hey everyone!

So a couple months ago I had some money laying around and I decided I wanted to try new things to see if I could earn some extra bucks. As background, I knew I could risk this money since I have a good joob and I didn't need it to survive, and I like crypto (bad combination some would say).

That's when I remembered Binance has this feature where you can copy trade people and share the profits. So I bought some USDT and sent it to my Binance account to get started.

# Initial Strategy

I have some experience with trading, but nothing too crazy. And I'm very familiar with the crypto world, I joined in 2019. But despite that, I never tried copy trading in general, let alone using Binance platform, so I wasn't really sure of what strategy to follow.

After some thought, I decided I didn't want to put all the eggs in a single basket, and decided I wanted to ""test"" the traders before giving them more money. Especially because I was going to use futures instead of spot trading.

I started testing the traders with an initial balance of 50 USDT, and I'd increase it on a monthly basis depending on their results.

I didn't know what to expect, so I chose the traders mainly on PnL/ROI, but that was pretty much it.

As you may expect already, choosing traders based on PnL/ROI was kind of a mistake. Some of the traders were super aggressive and used high amounts of leverage (one of them was using x125 lol), meaning that they were getting crazy returns when they won, but also losing pretty much everything when they lost.

After the first month I realized this and started searching for traders that matched a specific criteria, traders must have the following:

* Decent amount of days in the platform (+100 ideally)
* Low amount of previosuly closed wallets (less than 3 ideally)
* Decent returns but not crazy in the last 90 days (10/-50% range)
* Steady PnL/ROI chart upwards
* Low MDD (around 20% max)
* Decent sharpe ratio

As you can see, I became more selective with the traders that I choose (and I will probably continue adjusting this based on the results), and I stopped expecting quick crazy returns.

# Results

In total I copied 20 different traders and as a way to share the results, I created a spreadsheet where you can better visualize the results that I got divided by each trader:

[https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg)

*NOTE: PnL for traders currently open include PnL for open positions, and does not include profit sharing (usually 10%).*

As you can see, most of the traders that I started copying during first month are now closed. Main reason is that I didn't like their strategy/risk management and I didn't feel comfortable copying them, or they directly lost everything.

Luckily, second batch of traders I chose using the adjusted strategy seem to be doing good. But it's still early to jump into conclusions since I started copying them less than a month ago. I wait at least a month before deciding to give them more capital as I mentioned before.

# Final Numbers

In order to better visualize the results, I created this simple summary:

[https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg)

As you can see, despite all the loses, I still managed to earn 129USDT, close to 8% return in 2 months. Mainly thanks to a single trader that I deployed more capital to and did extremely good. 🙏

# Conclusions & How to continue

I think that the adjustment in the strategy was a good choice that will help me to reduce the risks when choosing traders to copy, so I will continue adjusting and improving it as I gather more data.

Also, since I wanted to have multiple options, I tested a ton of traders, but as I continue adjusting the strategy, I will start reducing the amount of new traders that I give an opportunity to so I can focus on giving more capital to the ones that I already have and that are doing good.

The idea is to stabilize the returns by having different traders with different strategies (but always inside a certain range) and start to slowly deploy more capital so I can increase the $$ returns.

# Thank you!

Hope you liked this post. I created it mainly to share the results I got and get some feedback from more experienced people.

I know copytrading is usually a very controversial topic but hopefully we can share our knowledge between us!",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Say I want to create my own coin. 1 billion supply.

Is it possible to

-increase the supply or decrease the total supply programically? 

-reduce the value of an owners current coin. If coin has 0 activity/movement, relinquish 10% of it's value annually. Send the relinquished amount back to the system (I don't know the proper term for this) to be burned or held. So if 1 coin is valued at $10, the owner would now own 9/10, $9 vs 10/10. The Blockchain would show the coin traveling out of the owners wallet. If coin is in cold storage, it would automatically do checks before any activity is done.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"New scam inviting you to take part in a raffle by ""Binance"" by SMS",2024-10-06 10:47:48,"https://preview.redd.it/zmlltt8j84td1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=39ded02053f939651474894383c786aebd5d9068

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a heads-up about a potential phishing scam I received. I got a text message claiming to be from Binance, inviting me to participate in their ""Tombola Binance RO"" raffle. The message included a link: binance.aets-withdrawal.com.

**Red flags:**

* **Suspicious link:** The link in the message doesn't look like a legitimate Binance URL.
* **Official-looking number:** While the sender's number might seem official, scammers often use spoofing techniques to make their messages appear legitimate.
* **Urgency:** The message creates a sense of urgency, urging you to participate immediately.

**Stay safe:**

* **Never click on links in unsolicited messages.** If you're unsure about a message, go directly to the official Binance website or app to check for any promotions or raffles.
* **Verify the sender's identity.** Be cautious of messages from unknown numbers, even if they appear to be from a reputable company.
* **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Binance account.** This adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your account.

**Remember:** Binance will never ask you for your private information or passwords via text message or email. If you receive a suspicious message, report it to Binance's customer support immediately.

4. Voting consensus transactions & failed transactions massively bloat the blockchain size, **currently \~265 TB & growing fast.** 

5. Again, **TPS includes voting consensus and failed transactions**, failed transactions on most other blockchains are strictly validated before even hitting the blockchain. 

6. **Firedancer** is live on mainnet, but in 'non-voting mode' which means it cannot produce blocks and is **only doing about \~30% of what a validator does.** 

7. **RPC endpoint architecture allows operators to reorder transactions and front-run.** 

8. ***$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.*** (Repeated due to importance).

10. **The Top 18 validators control +33% of the entire staked Solana supply, meaning they can collaboratively block consensus and censor transactions.**

Then we entered the institutional period, where it seemed like crypto would move into a phase of real maturity and strong development.

**Consecutive SEC lawsuits**: Almost every project issuing tokens was pursued by the SEC, undermining the market’s legitimacy.

**Frauds**: Scandals like FTX and other frauds further tarnished the market’s image.

**Memecoins**: The frenzy around meme coins adds chaos and gives critics more reason to dismiss this market as not serious.

**Venture Capital shitcoins**: Billions of locked tokens being dumped on us on a regular basis by greedy capitalists who did little to help the market with their second-layer or ghost chains.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Will Bitcoin Crash to $20k Again? Analyzing Historical Trends and Potential Risks,2024-10-06 11:33:35,"I've been looking at the 1W Bitcoin chart and noticed a recurring pattern: after every all-time high (ATH) above $60,000, there's a significant price correction in the range of 50-70%. This happened in 2021 after the April peak, and again in 2022 following the 2021 November ATH.

Considering we reached a new ATH this March, and the price has been forming lower highs and lower lows since then, it makes me wonder: are we heading for another major downturn?

Historically, Bitcoin has experienced these cycles, especially after halving events. However, there are other factors to consider this time around:

* **Increased Market Maturity:** Bitcoin has gained more mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption. Could this potentially dampen volatility?
* **Macroeconomic Uncertainty:** Global economic conditions are playing a role, and these are different from previous cycles.
* **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Increased regulation could impact investor sentiment.

Personally, I'm a bit anxious, especially after my experience with Mt. Gox. I'm hoping to avoid another major crash, but I also know that anything is possible with Bitcoin.

What do you all think? Are we in for another deep correction, or are there reasons to be more optimistic this time?",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

The requirement of an exchange will forever prevent crypto from truly being a decentralized currency. The exchanges hold the power and control of who and how they buy and sell crypto. 

Germany and the EU are bringing about more stern KYC regulations for 2025, Kraken as an example chose to push their DE customers onto a thirdparty banking firm. The point isn't whether or not Kraken could have done something better, the point is the users are, and will always be, dependent upon the decisions of the exchanges that they use. 

If there was a way to buy and sell crypto without an exchange, then the crypto universe would truly be decentralized, and a digital currency environment truly controlled by its participants. Is this even possible, what would this look like?

Gox.

In this setup, I could use two randomly generated emails exclusively for security, with randomized, long passwords. These emails would serve as recovery for each other, with added security like a hardware key (e.g., YubiKey).

For my Coinbase account, I might use an extremely strong password and require a security key for access. To further secure the assets, I could set up a vault with a withdrawal delay and whitelist addresses to give me time to react to any suspicious activity.

For redundancy, I might manage passwords using physical pieces of paper and store duplicate security keys in separate bank safety deposit boxes.

Would this approach be robust enough for protecting my crypto assets, or are there any potential vulnerabilities or improvements that I should consider?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Detailed Market Analysis - Why we will likely see a major flash crash the next days and how to avoid panic,2024-10-05 18:47:39,"
Hi all, 

I did take my time reading through the rules of this subreddit, and concluded that this would be a welcome post for the group here. 

I am an individual that has been fixated on analyzing and understanding Bitcoin over the last 6-7 years now. My track record has included suggesting a buy zone / long entry at 16,500 December 2022, with a target price of 65,000. As you can imagine at that time, I was laughed at quite a bit, considering at that point in time Bitcoin had broken and retested a major Bearish Pennant pattern on the daily time frame. 

I’ve come to learn that Bitcoin moves by not only liquidity, but specifically liquidity from stop loss orders - due to the dominance of high leverage usage on the exchange platforms people trade futures on. 

I have laid out my anticipated scenario here for you in a very clean chart. The flash crash scenario moves as follows; 

1) 62,200 to 35,000

2) 35,000 slight retracement up to 43,000 zone 

3) 43,000 to 7,000 - 10,000

This however is not a DOOM scenario for Bitcoin, it would be a liquidity sweep prior to a Bull Market on BTC / equities spanning out 1-2 years and likely resulting in a 120k to 240k BTC value. 

While many argue that a black swan event is required to move the market in such an extreme manner, I disagree. 

I propose to you that crypto is the trading market that deviates from the logical restrictions we give to price flexibility in Equities and Forex markets. Crypto is (A) a weekend operated market, (B) price movement is dominated by high leveraged futures positions, and (C) exchanges and market makers benefit directly from traders liquidations and fees paid when opening positions. We can deduce from these three points that there is more interest against traders succeeding by the very platforms they trade on than any other market, and furthermore, an interest in sudden, fast, and extreme movements aimed to liquidate inattentive traders. We can also understand that being a weekend market, untied from the associations to equities and forex hours, it is an animal of its own intentions. Lastly, I will lay out further information in detail about the hidden power of futures stop losses driving the price of Bitcoin in fast and extreme movements, which is the mechanic I propose makes this trade possible and DOES NOT rely on any sort of black swan event to occur. 

I’ve spent a lot of time on this theory, and while I can write and write essays in this post, I will update in the comments as we progress as well as answer any questions. 

Understand this is not a matter of having a dislike for Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, I truly have no emotional attachment to what I trade. I am of the opinion that the liquid value of Bitcoin has no strong correlation to its value as a technology and its function as an asset. If this was to occur, I foresee it happening very quickly, and equally quickly returning to its $50,000 + price and climbing over the next years to upwards of $150k. 

I’d like to encourage keeping comments and discussion on the basis of respect of understanding price movement of Bitcoin (and relatively all cryptocurrencies) - and refrain from making this a personalized discussion of taking any sides. In other words, I am an analyst interested in price movement. Price moves up and down always, not one or the other. 

The last information I will leave on the main post is a summary of how I have come to understanding and trading Bitcoin over the last 6 years of trial and experimenting. 

Here are key points of the way I approach Bitcoin, that I feel are unique and worth mentioning. 

1. The vast majority of bitcoins movement is caused by stop loss orders cascading one into the next, and performing pre-determined chain reactions as they are filled. The market is dominated by futures trading; and this has a major effect on the spot price of Bitcoin. A trader using $100 for a long at 100x is leaving in the form of his stop loss; a $10,000 limit sell order that fills ONLY if price crosses over / below. Unique to limit orders that fill automatically if price is at a premium or discount, stop losses stay in tact until price passes them. Retail traders and those placing orders are only crawling the market along until it begins hitting those stop losses. That’s why bitcoin volatility comes at odd times - the reality is, it’s not caused by human engagement. It’s caused by the decisions traders have made in the past. 

2. Exchanges and market makers profit off of liquidation fees and interest on leverage. Stop loss placement is protected information for a reason; the exchanges and market markets communicate this information, to allow themselves to benefit and you to commit more money to the market. 

3. The Bitcoin chart works on trendlines that cut through - this is often when we see as price consolidation. Bitcoin easily weaves inside and outside of these trendlines due to stop losses sending price to fill the order chains. The invalidations are simply a phenomenon of futures trading prominence. Eventually, one side catches just like a normal trendline - in an abnormal relationship because price is never neatly contained inside or outside - that’s what makes bitcoin prediction so difficult. 

4. DXY is still the best predictor of Bitcoin volatility and as to which direction listed in point 3 will execute. Especially when DXY is approaching a major pivot or direction change, Bitcoin reacts very well with moves to liquidate the opposite side before DXY has a lengthy downward or upward movement (Bitcoin generally moves in opposition).

5. Market manipulation is subtle and occurs with consolidation. Price is contained and controlled, by MM placing counter orders to balance the price moving too far into a particular direction. The consolidation periods attract futures positions for their stop loss orders - and that’s the function that makes moving Bitcoin in the favour of the exchanges / MM in a way that benefits them and also in a way that’s legitimate - as it’s in fact caused by traders own choices. The counter balancing / controlled consolidation is a practice that on paper “prevents manipulation” and “increases liquidity to reduce volatility”. Quite clever. 

6. Since stop loss orders are limits placed in the chart that don’t fill automatically if price is above or below - we can analyze the open gaps on the chart along with consolidation periods to develop a good sense of the stop loss orders in the chart and where price is likely to move. 

7. Stop Loss orders helps us to predict not only direction, but also the speed and distance Bitcoin will move. The more stop losses; the greater the speed of the compounding movement and cascading effects. The longer the consolidation periods, and the larger the gaps are that price has not recovered; the more stop losses are in place. In other words, the movement of Bitcoin is predetermined and thought of like a chain of explosives that are fused together. As soon as that first stop loss triggers, the more exponentially the speed increases as the orders are already in place - and hence why we see many large wicks in Bitcoin. 

8. The fiat conversion of Bitcoin is very fluid and not a firm metric for Bitcoins health. Liquidity can move in and out of the balloon of Bitcoin extremely fast. The finite quantity of Bitcoin and its scarcity and quantity, is not relative to the fiat conversion. One bitcoin is one bitcoin - whether it is at $10 or $100,000. The fiat evaluation of Bitcoin is more-so determined by the “online casino” of sorts that takes place inside the container of Bitcoin; giving us a volatile, moving fiat conversion that ultimately is not relative to the value of Bitcoin as it’s own entity - it’s only relative if Bitcoin is converted back into fiat.

9. There are several hard limitations that stock and equities share that Bitcoin does not. Company share values are limited by the anchors they have in the real world - IE employees and wages, product sales, infrastructure, supply / demand. The evaluation of these companies is not nearly as fluid as Bitcoin for these reasons. The companies are directly related and tied to the system of the economy. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have these reality anchors that provide floors and ceilings to price movement. 

10. There is a degree of human intentionality behind Bitcoins chart and movement. In other words, more so than any other asset, its price projection is planned by human design. The market is funded upon liquidity from retail traders, predominantly in futures markets. The business of exchange leveraging is astronomical, and Market Makers control the great majority of liquidity via their automated systems and order placement services. Join that information with the profit structure and beneficiaries of our liquidations; and we can base a logical conclusion that there is a sole vested interest in the way Bitcoin’s price moves. That is; in favour of liquidating the common Joe and Jane. This allows us a unique advantage to be able to strategize with a business-focused mindset, more so that any other asset class. This is largely due to the lack of regulations and available information with international crypto exchange platforms and Market Makers.

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past. And asking them to train their infosec and opsec teams to learn how to deal with these algorithms that slow down performance will be a difficult task.",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

NOTE = I don't know if I'll release the code on github, surely at the moment it's a bit messy :P",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3.

Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Originally I was told to refer to the Intel Manuals to learn more about cryptographic hardware extensions.

However I admit I have no experience in hardware RTL designs nor assembly. Plus Intel CPUs are proprietary and I can't just make edits to them without risking lawsuits (or worse). So I decided to pay attention to the RISC-V Cryptographic Hardware Extensions--which are open source.

Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 11:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-10-07 12:19:03.767293

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);

        return record;

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663
        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(p), [0,7]).order()
        115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,
        79820197542983972470655013754473404410649480536210503962616926227235987362275
        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 16:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code. If your team-mates cannot understand how your code works, without it being correct, your team-mates won't be able to improve the code without your help. I thought this was an insightful statement. And it illustrates a common problem in crypto development: we often see code that is secure against the latest attacks but is esoteric. Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Even if the code is flawed, as long as your team-mates can refactor the code the code that is legible but flawed will eventually be improved and outshine the original code that is correct **but** illegible.
