Recent bearish pressure has driven the token to a point where a recovery might be on the horizon, yet the critical question is: can buyers defend this level and push prices higher? With momentum shifting and market sentiment in flux, the scene is set for either a breakout on the upside or a breakdown. This article aims to analyze ApeCoin’s resilience at a critical support level, exploring whether current market dynamics could spark a rebound. Through a breakdown of technical indicators and recent price action, we seek to analyze the possibility of a bullish reversal or signs of continued downward pressure on ApeCoin. Technical Analysis: Signs Af A Rebound Or Breakdown? APE’s price on the 4-hour chart is consolidating above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the key $1 support level, indicating market indecision. While the position above the SMA suggests an optimistic trend, this consolidation could lead to a rally or strong decline, depending on whether bulls or bears take control. Meanwhile, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for ApeCoin shows bearish signals, as its SMA line edges toward a crossover below the signal lines near the zero level. This crossover attempt is typically seen as a bearish indicator, suggesting that downside momentum may be gaining steam. A successful crossover below the signal lines could confirm a shift in trend, potentially signaling more selling pressure on APE in the near term. Related Reading: Is Apecoin On Your Radar? APE Soars By 30% In 48 Hours, Signaling A Potential Bull Run On the daily chart, APE is in a consolidation phase while showing downbeat strength as it nears the $1 mark. Although it trades above the 100-day SMA, the increasing selling pressure raises concerns about its ability to stay above the $1 level. This combination of consolidation and bearish momentum could indicate a struggle to maintain its position, potentially leading to a decline if the bearish trend continues. A detailed analysis of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator shows that ApeCoin is overbought, indicating possible extended losses. The signal line is attempting to cross below the SMA line, which usually signals a shift in momentum toward the downside and increasing selling pressure. If this crossover happens, it could reinforce the likelihood of continued declines, leading traders to reconsider their positions amid the weakening bullish sentiment. Risk Vs. Reward: What’s Next For ApeCoin? Based on the analysis, ApeCoin’s price appears poised for a drop toward the $1 support level. A breakdown below this mark could lead to additional losses for the cryptocurrency, which could push it down to the $0.660 support level and beyond. Related Reading: ApeCoin Climbs 21% In Last 7 Days As Sentiment Remains Bullish However, if ApeCoin breaks above the $1 mark, the price is likely to move upward toward the $1.7 resistance level. Furthermore, a breach of this level could trigger further upward movement, potentially leading to the $2.1 resistance level and beyond.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading with a 0.07% gain in the past 30 days, which reveals the current consolidation situation it finds itself under.  However, according to a technical analysis on TradingView, the Ethereum price could be well on its way to reaching a new all-time high after 12 weeks of consolidation. Ethereum Price Completes Bottom Formation According to a technical analysis of the Ethereum price in the weekly candlestick timeframe, the cryptocurrency is currently in its 12th week of consolidation after a decline that ended in the first week of August. Interestingly, analysis reveals that the consolidation is at the bottom of the lower trendline in a Channel Up trend in the weekly timeframe that started as far back as June 2022. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 Particularly, a close look at this Channel Up trend reveals that the Ethereum price action has been confined between its upper and lower trendlines in the past two and a half years. Fortunately, the trend is a bullish one with the creation of higher highs and higher lows, which suggests a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price. As it stands, the Ethereum price has been on an uptrend since the beginning of the week, essentially reversing last week’s declines. Consequently, the price has flipped from bearish to neutral on the weekly outlook and is now moving towards bullish. The only thing left is for the Ethereum price to keep pushing on this uptrend and flip above the weekly MA50 (50-Day Moving Average). A successful push above this level, according to crypto analyst InvestingScope, would not only signal an end to Ethereum’s prolonged consolidation but also set the stage for a rally toward the channel’s upper trendline. ETH On The Journey To Recording New Highs As it stands, the 1W Relative Strength Index has already crossed over its MA, lending charge to the momentum. All that’s left now is an Ethereum price break above the weekly MA50. A break above the MA50 on the weekly timeframe would confirm the shift from consolidation to bullish momentum, draw in fresh buying interest and open up Ethereum’s path to creating a higher high within the Channel Up structure.  Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline The Channel Up structure is structured in such a way that the creation of a new higher high at this point would necessitate a break above the current all-time high of $4,900. A touch of the upper trendline in the Channel Up would see the Ethereum price peaking above $5,500 before undergoing any major correction. “When that happens, aim for no lower than the All Time High (TP = 4,900),” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,631. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Today, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market stands at $2.44 trillion, an increase of 1.61% from the previous day. Most of the digital assets are in the green zone meaning that their prices are rising and the outlook of the market is generally positive. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X? Analyst Sees Opportunity Despite On-Chain Decline In this latest market frenzy, one storyline is attracting attention and some analysis: while Bitcoin is outperforming the rest and retesting $73,000, Ethereum is struggling to hit its target of $4,000. The diverging performances between the two top digital assets now serve as an interesting sub-plot to an exciting week ahead for the general cryptocurrency industry. Ethereum And Bitcoin- A Contrasting Story Of Market Run As the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, it’s natural for analysts and observers to take a second look at Ethereum and Bitcoin. While both digital assets have notched some gains, with Bitcoin rising by 1.90% and ETH by 2.59%, they still paint contradicting storylines. $ETH is moving according to plan but is underperforming BTC from the past few weeks.

Last Tuesday, BTC tested the $73k level again, and analysts expect it will record another all-time high soon. In contrast, Ethereum’s run has been sluggish, falling short of expectations. While ETH joined other coins in a mini-rally this week, its current price of $2,687 is still far from the analysts’ target of $4,000. ETH’s Recent Run- What Analysts Are Saying The contrasting price runs and milestones for both top cryptos have attracted some attention. For most analysts, Bitcoin’s recent price performance validates its standing as the current top digital asset. Ethereum’s struggles to hit the elusive $4k have been criticized by some traders and analysts, with many stating that Solana is now “the next Ethereum.” ETH is not dying.#ETH / #BTC is doing what it always does.

Besides boasting of high throughput and low fees while protecting traders from maximal extractive value (MEV) bots, the platform has been striking key partnerships. Injective Integrates With Fetch.ai And ASI This week, the proposal by Fetch.ai and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) community to integrate Injective was passed synonymously. The proposal passed with 100% of the votes agreeing with the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Expect 98% Crash After Blow Off To $250,000, Here’s Why Looking at voting data, over 324 million FET voted to endorse the idea, with only 656 FET rejecting it. No one voted to abstain or veto. Voting started on October 23 and ended five days later on October 28. According to the proposal, the goal is to revive the expired IBC client for Injective under “Revive expired IBC client for Injective.” In this way, Fetch.ai, now part of the ASI Alliance, can harness the power of AI within the sprawling Injective DeFi ecosystem. This arrangement will allow Fech.ai, an AI-centric platform, to directly plug its machine learning and AI capabilities into the Injective platform. Out of this, users will benefit from streamlined and leveraged AI-enabled tools when trading. The team also said they would benefit from improved liquidity management and asset allocation. Even with this deal, Injective and ASI will continue operating independently. The integration isn’t a merger but an Injective tapping into ASI’s AI capabilities. Why Is INJ Down? Bullish as this may be, INJ prices ticked lower, looking at the events in the daily chart. Injective bulls have yet to reverse losses posted on October 25 comprehensively. Accordingly, despite the series of higher highs over the weekend and in the first half of the week, sellers are in control. So far, INJ is down 20% from October highs and continues consolidating inside a $10 zone. Clear resistance is around $25, while support is at $15. If the bulls of Q1 2024 flow back, momentum will likely pick up once buyers break above the $25 level, preferably with increasing engagement.

In its third-quarter filing ending September 30th, 2024, the company disclosed its revenues were up by 165%, and its overall year-to-date (YTD) net deposits increased to $34 million. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion USDT Mint On Tron: What’s Fueling The Demand Surge? It’s a promising development for Robinhood Markets this quarter after facing plenty of challenges in the past. The company took a hit in early 2021 after it decided to restrict trading in GameStop and other meme stocks during a market frenzy. In a separate statement, Robinhood shared that it’s inching closer to a settlement with investors and traders. Q3 Filing Is Company’s Second-Best Revenue Despite its challenging backstory and the SEC’s regulatory pressures, Robinhood Markets found its rhythm to post a solid third-quarter performance. The company shared that its net deposits grew to $34 billion, and revenue increased 36% yearly to $367 million, with its cryptocurrency unit leading the surge. In its filing, Robinhood stated that its cryptocurrency revenue increased to $61 million over the quarter or 165%. Market observers expected this growth after the company completed its takeover of Bitstamp, thus pushing its trading volume. Robinhood Surprises With Impressive Growth Robinhood’s growth story impressed many market observers and analysts, given its recent experience with FTX, the ‘meme frenzy,’ and run-ins with the SEC. Last year, the company bought back its shares from Alameda Research for $605 million. At the time of the transaction, many observers expected that Robinhood would avoid cryptocurrency investments. However, the company surprised analysts by making crypto a critical investment through its Robinhood Crypto unit. For its Q3 filing, Robinhood’s Asset Under Custody (AUC) surged by 76% year-over-year to more than $152 billion. The firm reported that its holdings increased due to higher equity, better crypto valuation, and sustained deposits. The company has a portfolio heavy on Bitcoin, and the recent rise in the top crypto bodes well for the firm, which will continue to earn as long as the trend remains bullish for BTC.

Last May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to the company. The agency argued that some of Robinhood’s cryptocurrency services violate securities laws. Interestingly, the SEC has not filed a case against the company. In the meantime, Robinhood Markets is business as usual. Based on reports, Robinhood has listed several tokens and allowed transfers for assets like SOL. However, access to the service is limited to EU customers.

With the $0.17 price level cleared, the next step is a convincing break above $0.18. Interestingly, technical analysis of the Dogecoin price suggests a strong multi-year resistance level between $0.18 and $0.20. Technical analysis using Elliot waves suggests a break above the resistance levels could open up the path to a peak of $2.4. While this target may seem ambitious, Dogecoin has attracted renewed popularity and recent price gains, which reflect its ability to capture investor interest. This is particularly evident in recent actions by billionaire Elon Musk, who brought Dogecoin into the mainstream conversation.  Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin To $2.4, Elon Musk A Huge Factor Aside from the recent wider increase in crypto prices spearheaded by Bitcoin, it is evident that the current Dogecoin performance has also been bolstered by Elon Musk and his “Department Of Government Efficiency.”  Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 According to an analysis by an analyst that goes by @HovWaves on social media platform X, Dogecoin is prime for a surge to $2.4. As you can imagine, reaching this level would require Dogecoin to attract investment inflows from every corner of investor cohorts. Fortunately, recent events have been drawing increased attention to Dogecoin, one of which is the presidential election campaigns in the United States. Campaigns have seen the introduction of the Department of Government Efficiency by Elon Musk, which is a campaign tactic by Republican candidate Donald Trump to cut $2 trillion in federal spending. Although seemingly unrelated to cryptocurrencies, the term has caught waves among Dogecoin investors, especially as it abbreviates as DOGE, the Dogecoin ticker. Interestingly, Elon Musk has fueled this narrative among Dogecoin investors by recently posting a picture of him alongside the Dogecoin avatar. As HovWaves noted, all the talk surrounding the Department Of Government Efficiency has made DOGE a household name in recent weeks. This surge in interest is reflected in the Dogecoin price, which has increased by 60% since October 1. Dogecoin’s Timeline To Reaching $2.4 According to technical analysis using the Elliot Wave theory, Dogecoin is currently on the third impulse wave, a phase known to be massively bullish. This bullish trend has seen Dogecoin on its way to breaking above a major resistance level, which HovWaves highlighted to be just below $0.18. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline A successful breakout of the resistance level would open up the stage for Dogecoin to retest its 2024 high of $0.22.

With enough momentum, HovWaves predicted Dogecoin would eventually settle at a price target in the $1.9 to $2.9 confluence area by July 2025. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1725. A break towards $1.9 and $2.9 would reflect 1,000% and 1,585% gains, respectively. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

WIF is trading just above $2.5, a key support level that top analyst and investor Ali Martinez believes could be a launchpad for a 17% surge to the $3 mark.  Martinez shared a technical analysis highlighting WIF’s strong base above $2.5, signaling that bullish momentum is building for the token. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target – Analyst As WIF holds above this crucial level, investor optimism and trading volume are rising, suggesting that both short-term and long-term holders are preparing for another leg up. The next few days—or even hours—could be decisive, as WIF sits at a pivotal point that could set the stage for significant gains.  With interest in meme coins surging and market sentiment favoring breakout plays, Dogwifhat is on track to test the $3 mark soon. If WIF breaks through, it may continue to draw more interest as one of the leading tokens in this meme coin cycle. Dogwifhat Holding Above Key Support Level Dogwifhat (WIF) has remained in a consolidation phase after reaching a local high of $2.97, now stabilizing above a crucial support level at $2.5. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, this consolidation period could set the stage for a breakout.  Martinez shared a technical analysis on X highlighting a bullish pattern forming on WIF’s 1-hour timeframe, suggesting that the token may soon be ready to push higher. Martinez’s analysis indicates that WIF’s resistance level within this bullish pattern sits around $2.6. Should WIF break above this key resistance, a surge to the $3 mark is anticipated, which could spark renewed interest in the token.  As meme coin traders know, FOMO (fear of missing out) can drive demand rapidly, especially for tokens with strong online communities and viral appeal. A move above $3 could position Dogwifhat as a top contender among this cycle’s meme coins, potentially leading to increased trading volume and broader market interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Reveal Increasing Network Activity – Is DOGE Ready To Break Yearly Highs? However, broader market conditions, particularly Bitcoin’s price action, will play a crucial role in determining whether WIF and other meme coins continue their uptrend. Many traders and analysts are watching Bitcoin closely, as a push above its all-time high could catalyze a rally across the entire market.  If BTC breaks into new highs, the resulting optimism and influx of capital could serve as the final push that Dogwifhat needs to leap to the $3 mark and beyond. Until then, WIF remains in a holding pattern, with its potential for a breakout hinging on technical triggers and broader market sentiment. WIF Technical Levels To Watch Dogwifhat (WIF) trades at $2.56, breaking above the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) set at $2.49. This move above the 200 MA signals bullish momentum, and WIF firmly holds the $2.52 level. Previously a resistance, this $2.52 mark supports the token’s uptrend. For WIF bulls to build further momentum, the price must push past the $2.7 mark, potentially paving the way for a run to local highs around $3. Breaking through these levels could attract renewed buying interest, especially as the market anticipates broader upward movements in leading assets.  However, should WIF fail to maintain its position above the $2.5 mark, it may face a pullback, with support likely in a lower demand zone around $2.41.

This bullish sentiment is evident in recent trading activities on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where Bitcoin options have experienced some of their highest trading volumes ahead of the US presidential election. Bitcoin To Rise Above $79,300? Joshua Lim, co-founder of Arbelos Markets—a trading firm providing liquidity across cryptocurrency derivatives markets—shared insights on X about these notable trades. “CME Bitcoin options just experienced some of its largest volume days ever, ahead of the US election,” Lim stated. He highlighted two substantial transactions that occurred in the past week. On Friday the 25th, traders purchased 1,875 Bitcoin units of the 29-November $70,000 strike calls. In options trading, a call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a specified strike price before the option expires. In this case, the strike price is $70,000, meaning the buyers are betting that Bitcoin will exceed this price by the end of November. Lim detailed that at the time of the trade, “$8.3 million of premium was paid, $147,000 of vega, $65 million of delta.” Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $200,000 Only If The Dollar Falls? Bitwise CIO Answers Then, on Tuesday the 29th, another significant trade occurred with the purchase of 3,050 Bitcoin units of the 29-November $85,000 strike calls, where the strike price is $85,000. Lim noted that “$4.6 million of premium was paid, $173,000 of vega, $42 million of delta” at the time of the trade. The amounts of $8.3 million and $4.6 million indicate substantial investment, reflecting strong confidence in Bitcoin’s potential rise. The high vega suggests that the traders expect significant volatility, which could be massive around the US election. Delta represents how much the option’s price is expected to change with a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset. High delta values of $65 million and $42 million imply substantial exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. The total notional value of these positions—the total value of the underlying assets represented by the options—is approximately $350 million. Lim pointed out that this is “large even in the context of Deribit,” referring to the world’s largest crypto options exchange.

This means that for the traders to start making a profit, Bitcoin’s price needs to exceed this level by the option’s expiry date. This price represents about a 16% increase from Bitcoin’s price when these trades were executed. “Very bullish positioning into the election, and great to see institutions sizing up like this on CME,” Lim commented. He added, “Perhaps a good sign that there is and will be growing liquidity in the crypto derivatives markets as the asset class matures.” The timing of these trades is particularly noteworthy. With the US presidential election imminent, market volatility is expected to increase, potentially impacting the entire Bitcoin and crypto market. Overall, the majority of experts believe that a Trump victory is bullish for the BTC price. At press time, BTC traded at $72,382.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Expect 98% Crash After Blow Off To $250,000, Here’s Why",2024-10-31 12:00:50+00:00,"A crypto analyst has forecasted a 98% Bitcoin price crash following a substantial rally to $250,000. Interestingly, the analyst is confident that Bitcoin will eventually reach this ambitious quarter-million-dollar target. However, they caution that once profits are taken at this top, Bitcoin could decline significantly to new lows.  Bitcoin Price Projected To Crash 98% On October 30, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen told his 106,700 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that the Bitcoin price could drop to the $24,000 range once it hits $250,000. Lagen revealed that many investors have felt overly confident that Bitcoin could never experience a 98% crash again, especially with the introduction of Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline Countering this overconfidence, the crypto analyst asserted that ETF assets tend to lose significant value during periods of economic recession. Consequently the analyst predicts that the Bitcoin price could first experience a “blowoff” of up to $250,000, marking a historical milestone. At this point, many investors would start taking profits, triggering massive selling pressure as they liquidate ahead of potential price declines.  Following Lagen’s analysis, once the market sentiment for the Bitcoin price shifts, institutional investors, who may have been the prime drivers for the $250,000 rally, are likely to sell off their holdings. Lagen has described this massive sell-off as the “shake out of the century,” when the Bitcoin price could plummet dramatically to 98% of its high.  This suggests that after hitting $250,000, the BTC price could crash to $2,000, trading below Ethereum’s current price, which is trading at $2,635, according to CoinMarketCap.  Highlighting the reasoning behind this unexpected bearish price crash, Lagen revealed that by plotting the Bitcoin price on the “Syslog scale,” it clearly shows a High-Time Frame (HTF) rising wedge, which points at a price target between $1,000 and $10,000. He also disclosed in a much earlier post that if Bitcoin does experience his projected shakeout and price decline to $1,000, it will take four halving events before the cryptocurrency can return to its $200,000 price high.  BTC To Break Above $73,000 And Rally Higher As of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $72,433 after experiencing more than a 7.8% increase this week. Lagen has stated that the Bitcoin price action points to a possible “triangle bearish continuation pattern,” which typically signals a potential downward trend in a cryptocurrency. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 The crypto analyst has set a new target of $71,200 for Bitcoin, suggesting that if the cryptocurrency follows through with the triangle bearish continuation pattern, its price could decline significantly. On the flip side, Lagen has predicted that if Bitcoin can break the $73,000 threshold, it would invalidate the triangle bearish continuation pattern. This could indicate the end of the downtrend and potentially lead to a stronger upward momentum.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Consolidates Near ATH – Volume Suggests A Big Move Ahead,2024-10-31 10:30:46+00:00,"Bitcoin has been trading in a tight 4-hour range between $71,300 and $73,300 since Tuesday, setting the stage for a significant move in the coming days. Analysts and investors closely watch this range as BTC inches closer to its all-time high (ATH).  Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared key data from CryptoQuant, noting that trading volume has steadily decreased as Bitcoin remains within these levels. Typically, this volume decline signals consolidation, a phase often preceding a major price swing. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Reveal Increasing Network Activity – Is DOGE Ready To Break Yearly Highs? Anticipation is building with the U.S. election just around the corner on November 5. Market sentiment is optimistic, and many expect Bitcoin to break out of this range soon, either pushing into new highs or experiencing a healthy retrace to fuel further growth.  The coming days will be pivotal for Bitcoin’s trajectory as traders assess whether the consolidation period will lead to a breakthrough into uncharted territory. As BTC flirts with its ATH, the stage is set for a decisive move that could shape the market’s direction through the end of the year. Bitcoin Price About To Move Bitcoin is at a defining point in this cycle, nearing the end of a 7-month accumulation period and poised to test new all-time highs. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler has noted in a recent analysis on X that BTC is currently range-bound, trading between $72,900 resistance and $71,400 support, with trading volumes showing a gradual decline.  According to Adler, this reduced volume in Bitcoin’s confined range hints at an impending breakout. However, a new catalyst appears necessary to drive this shift and launch BTC past its previous highs. The upcoming U.S. election may be that catalyst, with potential market impacts depending on the outcome. Market sentiment suggests that a Trump victory could stimulate bullish sentiment in the financial markets, possibly positively influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Investors are eyeing this pivotal event as a possible trigger to push BTC beyond the $73,794 mark, its all-time high, into uncharted price territory. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target – Analyst A successful breakout from the current range could usher Bitcoin into price discovery mode, where FOMO (fear of missing out) could drive buying pressure, amplifying the surge. On the other hand, if BTC fails to secure a new high, it may dip back toward lower support levels, potentially consolidating further until the necessary momentum builds.  BTC Flirting With ATH Bitcoin is holding strong above $72,000, inching closer to breaking its all-time high (ATH) and entering a price discovery phase. Price discovery typically ushers in significant gains, as fresh highs fuel market optimism and buying pressure.  However, BTC has yet to decisively break past its previous ATH of $73,794, and a temporary decline below $70,000 remains a possibility if demand doesn’t strengthen soon. The $71,000 support level now serves as a critical base for BTC. If the price holds above this mark in the coming days, momentum will likely build for a solid attempt to break the ATH, potentially triggering a new wave of bullish sentiment.  Traders and investors closely watch BTC’s performance at these levels, knowing that any sustained movement above $73,794 could signal the start of a powerful uptrend as Bitcoin pushes into uncharted territory.

Whether through a direct push or a minor pullback, Bitcoin’s resilience above $72,000 sets the stage for an imminent test of ATH, with price discovery and new highs on the horizon.

There is a recurring advice on finding more suitable memecoins to trade: check the team behind the meme! And see if they have had success before, or if they are serial rugpullers. I have had some success with trading lower cap memes, and now I want to slow down and trade memes that last more than a few minutes!

My question is, how to find the team behind the meme, and how to check their credentials (for the lack of a better word!)

I'm a bit confused as for me, I don't need to put the coin in an earning plan to earn stacking rewards and if the \~10% APR represents the stacking reward, the logic is contrary to what the LST technology wants to offer as it is ""locked"" in a plan (I know it's flexible but still in a plan as I cannot lend it for example).

Can someone enlight me on this topic ? TY",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531
Reddit,solana,Created A Meme Token And Now I Need Advice,2024-10-31 16:43:53,"Just an update from the last time I posted here. I create my meme token currently at $6K MC and ATH $8.5K MC, I know its not a lot but hey Im actually pushing every day for 22 days now. I won't give up as people have bought in and I won't let them down. 

I paid for DEX, I created TG around 150 members now, I created X going to start raiding it soon! 

I've got a plan which states what I  will do when Im on Raydium.  I have stated in the group at $50K MC I will publish those details its all to do with marketing. I have also a big give away at certain MC but I will be doing small surprise give aways, I have to look after my community. 

My question now is how do I push it from pump.fun to Raydium, Im shilling every day on TG groups or everywhere I get a chance. ",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

>**1/** At Nitro Labs, we believe dApps require not just speed but also flexibility and customization.  
>  
>That's why we're building Termina, the first SVM network deployment platform, helping developers create high-performance applications that need dedicated resources.

&#x200B;

>**2/** While Solana is incredibly fast, builders face challenges with congestion during spikes in on-chain usage, leading some projects to migrate to centralized servers due to cost or latency concerns.

&#x200B;

>**3/** Termina tackles this by providing individual blockspace, giving developers control over performance and scalability while keeping execution closely tied to the L1  
>  
>We're targeting use cases like DePIN, high-frequency trading, and payment networks that are best built on  [@solana](https://x.com/solana)

 

>**4/** Our core belief is that network extensions offer more than increased throughput, they're tools for experimentation and innovation to meet diverse needs beyond scaling.  
>  
>We aim to empower builders with the tools they need to innovate.

&#x200B;

>**5/** We believe SVM adoption will quickly overtake EVM's in this cycle, and consumer crypto will only continue to prosper in the Solana eco

I'm a full-stack developer (web2 & 3) as well as a trader.

I've primarily traded options for the past number of years, but recently have done some fun trading in the Solana ecosystem. 

While memecoins are fun and all, I'm thinking about seriously launching an on-chain decentralized options trading mechanism protocol on Solana. I've already mapped out most of the mechanisms and I've even started carving out the protocol already. 

I just wanted to see what the level of interest of such a protocol is from r/solana?

Initially, I'd probably just start off with Solana options, but eventually they could be expanded to any SPL token. Writers could stake underlying tokens and sell the exercise premium.

Thoughts? Interest levels? Thanks all!",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

The only problem is that a sniper got in the first second after the LP got created, he bought 9million tokens with 3.6 sol, and then fullclipped at 800k for 35sol, making a big red candle and scaring the people away :/  The token didn't die from this, but it sure didn't help...

I was thinking that one way to solve this problem would be if you could snipe your token when it hits Ray, buying in with another 50-100 sols, in order to raise the price high enough that other snipers can't buy too much supply for cheap. Could this be a good strategy? Also does anyone know some good bots that can do this? And do they require custom RPCs?

Please explain what am I missing?  I do understand that when you swap bigger amount you make a bigger price impact. but overall does it mean that less bigger transaction will impact the price of coin and Markcap less then a multitude of small transactions?

So the user is presented with a transaction to sign which would then get sent to the blockchain - how in this scenario the developer should make user trust this signed tx won't empty their wallet?

Reddit,solana,Zerion Wallet SWAP Redirected My Funds to an Unknown Address – Security Flaw or Scam?,2024-10-29 14:46:42,"I’m posting this because **Zerion** wallet just cost me funds in what looks like either a major UI failure or worse: an intentional setup to siphon funds. After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.

* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse. 

* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.

Reddit,solana,"[GUIDE] Shitcoin Trading: The High-Risk Strategy That Can Turn $50 Into $50,000",2024-10-28 10:12:28,"## (Warning: Most Traders Get Rekt)

Sup degens, how was the weekend? Your favorite degen philosopher is back with a new guide! 

  

Today we're diving into something that most traditional traders won't touch with a ten-foot pole - a systematic approach to trading shitcoins. 

  

But first, a reality check: this isn't financial advice! What you're about to read is closer to professional gambling than investing. 

  

If you're looking for a safe way to grow your wealth, stick to Bitcoin, ETH, stocks, or real estate.

### The Three-Step Strategy

Think of this like a video game where you're leveling up. Each step has its own risk level, required capital, and potential rewards. The key is starting small and only moving up when you've mastered the current level.

### Level 1: Micro Cap Warfare

This is where the wildest gains and fastest losses happen. We're talking about tokens so fresh you can smell the code being deployed.

  

Trade size: $5-$50. If that sounds too small, you're already thinking about this wrong.

  

Before you even think about trading, set your goals. Let's say you're starting with $50. Your target should be to grow it to $500 through a series of smaller trades. Not through one moonshot - that's called gambling. Having a clear target helps you make rational decisions instead of getting caught up in the ""what if it goes higher"" mentality.

  

Here's what you're looking for:

  

- Liquidity under $100k 
- At least 400 transactions per hour (can be lower, but the higher, the better) 
- Fresh pairs (minutes or hours old) 
- Target: 10x-100x gains 
  

Let me paint you a picture of how this typically plays out: You spot a fresh token launch with growing volume. You ape in $20 worth of SOL, setting up your grid sells immediately. Within an hour, the price pumps 5x. Your first grid sell triggers, taking profit on 25% of your position. Another thirty minutes pass - it hits 10x. Your second grid sell executes.

  

Then it happens - the price starts dropping fast. Manual traders are frantically watching the charts, emotions running high. 

  

""It'll bounce back,"" they tell themselves, watching their profits evaporate. But you? Your trailing stop loss kicks in automatically, securing your gains at 7x instead of the full 10x. Sure, you didn't hit your higher grid sells, but you walked away with real profit instead of hopium.

  

This is why automation is crucial at this level. The moves are too fast for human reaction time and too emotional for human decision making.

### Level 2: Medium Cap Mastery

Once you've grown your initial stack, it's time to play with slightly bigger fish. Your goal here should be specific - say, turning that $500 into $2,500 through a series of calculated plays.

  

Trade size: $50-$200

  

Here's what separates these plays from Level 1:

  

- Liquidity between $100k-$1M 
- 1000+ daily transactions 
- Pairs at least 2 weeks old 
- Target: 3x-10x gains 
  

Let's look at a typical Level 2 play: You find a token that's been trading for three weeks, showing steady growth in holders and volume. You enter with $100 when you notice whale accumulation patterns. Your grid sells are set at 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 5x.

  

Unlike Level 1, you might hold this for a day or two, but not much longer. Remember - these are still shitcoins, not investments. When volume spikes, your first grid sell hits at 1.5x. By evening, you've taken profits at 2x. The remaining position rides with your trailing stop, exiting at 2.5x when momentum slows twelve hours later. Clean, emotionless, profitable.

### Level 3: Large Cap Legends

Welcome to the big leagues. Your goal here should be turning that $2,500 into $10,000+ through steady, calculated moves.

  

Trade size: $200-$1000+

  

Your targets have evolved:

  

- Liquidity over $1M 
- Strong daily transaction count 
- Established pairs (1+ months) 
- Target: 2x-3x gains 
  

Here's what a Level 3 play looks like: You've identified a token with solid momentum and strong volume. You enter with $500 after careful analysis. While you might hold this position for a week or two, you're not investing here - you're trading with a clear exit strategy.

  

Your grid sells are conservative: 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x, 2.5x. The beauty of automation here is that you don't need to babysit your position. Set your grid sells, set your trailing stop, and let the system work. Maybe it takes three days to hit your targets, maybe it takes two weeks. Either way, your automated system ensures you stick to your plan instead of getting caught up in market emotions.

### The Reality Check

This game is incredibly risky and highly addictive. Your dopamine receptors will light up like a Christmas tree with every successful trade. You'll feel invincible after a few wins. That's exactly when the market usually teaches its most expensive lessons.

  

Success in this space requires iron discipline. Most traders can't handle it. They start with smart risk management, hit a few wins, get overconfident, and lose everything on one bad play. 

  

Don't be that trader.

  

The key to success in this game is having clear, achievable goals for each level. Don't just throw money at tokens hoping for the best. Before entering any trade, know exactly what profit you're targeting and what loss you're willing to accept. Without specific goals, you're just gambling. With them, you're executing a strategy. Is it still incredibly risky? Absolutely. But at least you're giving yourself a fighting chance.

  

The market doesn't care about your profit targets. It doesn't care about your hopes or dreams. It will happily take your money if you let it. Your only defense is strict risk management and the ability to walk away when things aren't going your way.

### The Bottom Line

This strategy can work, but it requires more discipline than most traders possess. If you decide to play this game, start small, use strict risk management, and never forget that you're essentially playing high-stakes poker with anonymous degens on the internet. 

  

Stay frosty, and may your stops hit before the rugs pull.

  

P.S. As always, if you're not using automated trading tools for this, you're bringing a knife to a gunfight.",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,solana,What are you using to Day-Trade tokens and minimise fees?,2024-10-29 01:31:13,"Hey,

I'm currently day trading pumpfun tokens and seeing some decent profits. Spent a few weeks testing some strategies and so far it's positive. I started with 1 SOL and now I'm at around 6 the platform fees are getting larger per transaction. I've searched but can't find a way around this, so I'm keen to understand what others are doing.

At the moment I'm tracking my trades on GMGN, then executing the buy and sell on Trojan. While the TP and SL are handy, it's not a must for me. I was trading directly through GMGN but they're 1% or each trade and TROJ is 0.9%.

On a 5SOL trade (buy and sell) I'm shelling out about $NZD30, which the gas + tip is less than 5% of the total fees paid. 

Is there any way to get around paying the 1% or 0.9% on these bots and just ""trade directly"" for example. Hope this makes sense and yes I realise this could be a very stupid question.

Reddit,solana,How to create a system??,2024-10-29 06:55:56,"Hi guys 
So I've been watching the top 10 solana meme coins on a daily basis for a while  and traded a few coins made a couple of bucks and left. And I traded purely based on some support and resistance and a RSI. 

But I've missed several opportunities because I was too late. 

And so my question is,  is it possible to create some sort of system that will notify if a certain coin is overbought or sold based on RSI for a select time frame. Is something like that possible?

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,2024-10-31 14:25:40,"# Here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. 

**First a bit of context:**

I guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like MetaMask). So you don’t use crypto the way you’d use Cash App or Revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day.

But the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling YouTube, Instagram, or WhatsApp. So, if we want Ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. Plus most people in Asia and Africa are mobile-first. 

**Why do I even talk about it?**

So we've been building Kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. Our idea has been to stay open and Ethereum-aligned. This means that we haven’t set up “Sign in with Google” or embedded wallets powered by Privy, Capsule, and others. We haven’t even built an Android or Apple app - we have a PWA app so that everyone can use it.

Since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing Ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. But unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work.

I've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from Istanbul to LA and saw people getting onboarded to our app. They used Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask and many other wallets. 

Metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. Rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. Coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing.

And it’s not only Kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like Zora. Some just say: “Ah yeah, it’s normal. I will figure it out once I get in front of my laptop”. Can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances?

Last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753)

And it’s not that the Ethereum community doesn’t care about the UX. Vitalik even said at one of his talks: “We should be as decentralized and open as Linux and Android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as Apple.”

But if Steve Jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from AppStore forever.

Wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. You can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. But this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder.

And the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. But it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. And the whole idea is to have your ENS and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. 

The question is, why does it keep happening? Maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from Firefox, through Chrome up to Opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. But then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time?

If we had solved the Merge, I imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. But it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum,Best practices for Anonymous Crypto Payment System With User Tracking and Minimal Gas Fee,2024-10-31 08:42:02,"Hello! I'm looking to implement a crypto payment system where users can deposit funds without logging in—ideally through a simple QR code scan or by pasting a wallet address. However, I still need a way to track each user and monitor their total deposits. 
The main requirements are: 
1. Users deposit anonymously without requiring login. 
2. The system needs to associate each deposit with a specific user ID for tracking purposes. 
3. I want to know how much each user has deposited over time. 
4. Ideally, I’d like to minimize gas fees and avoid dust deposits. 

Questions: 
1. Has anyone implemented a similar system or found ways to make anonymous deposits work while tracking users reliably? 
2. When scanning the QR code in MetaMask, the metadata field appears empty. Has anyone encountered this issue, and is there a workaround to pass data reliably with the QR code?
3. Would using smart contracts be feasible in this context? If so, how could I reduce gas fees and avoid creating dust amounts? 
4. Alternatively, is there a way to generate unique deposit addresses for each user and avoid dust completely?",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum,Help. Insanely high gas fees for a single transaction using Trust Wallet,2024-10-30 17:23:51,"Yesterday I tried to make a payment, so I bought some USDC on Ethereum network and sent it to my Trust Wallet. I moved $650$ worth of USDC and paid about $4-5 in gas fee for the transaction. No biggie.

I decided to not make the payment after all, and now I want to send back the USDC so I can sell them, but TrustWallet wants over $130 of gas fees. (UPDATE: IT'S OVER 270 NOW.)

How is this possible? Am I doing something wrong? How could the transaction cost about $4 yesterday and over $130 today? 

Btw I checked multiple times during the day and the cost was always insanely high.

I mean I understand gas fees are dependant on congestion of ETH network but $130 for a single transaction?

How can I get my money back to Revolut without losing almost $140 just for sending it back and forth? This is insanity.

On Trust Wallet there are multiple options of selling my USDC directly but I don't know if they are trustworthy(MoonPay or Ramp).

https://imgur.com/a/ffBjxVK


EDIT:
The fee is about $270 now. 😂😂 
Seriously, is Trust Wallet a scam? Am I overlooking something?

Even Swapping my USDC to ETH costs about $270. How could it cost 5$ yesterday, same ETH network, and today 270?

If someone has any idea how to help me get my money back without paying these insane fees, I will send him/her like $20 or so. Thank you.

Reddit,ethereum,Zerion Wallet SWAP Redirected My Funds to an Unknown Address – Intentional Scam or Security Flaw?,2024-10-29 14:52:09,"I’m posting this because **Zerion** wallet just cost me funds in what looks like either a major UI failure or worse: an intentional setup to siphon funds. After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.
* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse.
* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum,Liberation from the taboo on price discussions,2024-10-29 06:07:30,"The Ethereum community still seems to ignore or taboo discussions on price.

Even after the transition to POS, the equation of 'price = security' has been established for Ethereum.

In the debate with Bitcoin maximalists, the Ethereum community, including Vitalik, argued that the burning mechanism is better for increasing value than the fixed issuance amount.

This is also why Justin Drake's 'Ultra Sound Money' meme was born.

I think we need to discuss more seriously how to gradually increase the price of Ethereum. This is not just about making money. The goal is to make Ethereum the network with the strongest security and censorship resistance.

What Bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity. The belief in the immutable issuance rules. In the case of Ethereum, the policy on the total issuance amount seems too vague. I think this is Ethereum's worst selling point.

I thought about several monetary policies.

1. Increase the burn fee when the target total issuance exceeds 100 million, and reduce the burn fee when it falls below, maintaining 100 million.

2. Burn all fees including MEV to create endless deflation. When the total issuance decreases to 50 million, split the coin in half. Then, the number of Ethers will be 50 million -> 100 million -> 50 million -> 100 million repeatedly. People get excited when companies like Tesla and Nvidia do Stocksplit.

3. Set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum,"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared Vision",2024-10-26 11:41:15,"I’ve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. On the surface, they may seem like separate communities—one focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology—but at their core, they’re both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society.

Both UBI and Ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. They’re about creating a world where we don’t have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we’re looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. It’s about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society.

Money, when you think about it, is political. Every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. In a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper—into the structures that uphold our shared reality.

For those interested in diving further into this vision, here’s a bit of inspiration from popular culture:

- **Arrival** – A film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens.
- **Outlander** – A story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today.
- **Mad Men** – A look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception.
- **Devs** – A glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself.

These themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. Basic Income and Ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future.

What do you think? Are we ready to see that /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum might actually be part of the same community, working toward the same future?",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum,I can't understand L2 networks no matter what,2024-10-21 12:27:28,"So my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular L2 right and if I make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? 


If say bob sends 1 eth to Alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? 


And how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn?


please help, I can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are L2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues.



---




Edit: It finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/DepartedQuantity for helping me out.


So here's my understanding:

Till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the L1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the L1 as a single transaction with some proofs. And some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. 


But the thing is that the L2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. Connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. And all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network    are transactions details(or whatever) in L2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered.


And not L1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum, Ethereum builder centralization and your contribution,2024-10-18 22:13:25,"In recent weeks, more than 90% of Ethereum blocks have been built by just two block builders: beaverbuild.org and titanbuilder.xyz. This trend is growing, and it’s likely these two will dominate nearly all block production soon, profiting massively from users transactions MEV. [https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d](https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d)

The driving force behind this centralization is XOF (private orderflow), as explained by Toni Wahrstätter on X: [https://x.com/nero\_eth/status/1846786871998759141](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1846786871998759141)

So, where does this private orderflow originate?

For [titanbuilder.xyz](http://titanbuilder.xyz), it partly comes from BananaGunBot (https://x.com/BananaGunBot), as seen in blocks like this one: [https://etherscan.io/block/20959121](https://etherscan.io/block/20959121)

For [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org), it comes from platforms like [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (https://cow.fi/mev-blocker). Their FAQ states they submit to all major builders:

>MEV Blocker submits to all major block builders, including Builder0x69, f1b, Flashbots, rsync builder, Titan Builder, Gambit Labs, and Beaver Build.

But there is a catch: who created MEV Blocker? according to their FAQ:

>MEV Blocker is jointly formulated and maintained by CoW Protocol, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is open to all searchers and block builders.

The last part seems questionable. With control over the order flow, who would rationally share most profitable or important transactions with competitors?

It gets worse: a bot operated by beaverbuild uses the same calldata as the notorious jaredfromsubway MEV bot (https://x.com/MevRefund/status/1835666845547815067), suggesting beaverbuild likely operates the jared bot. jaredfromsubway is known for sandwiching pretty much everything and everyone (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f2f10d1c40777ae1da742455c65828ff36df387).

So, what’s my point? Avoid trading shitcoins, especially with BananaGun. And don’t use [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (rather make sure you have set your slippage tolerance correctly), which appears to be little more than a hypocritical frontend for beaverbuild.

Reddit,ethereum,Lido's Simple DVT Module Surpasses Expectations—A Deeper Look at Distributed Validator Technology's Future in Ethereum Staking,2024-10-18 11:50:36,"I’ve been keeping an eye on the recent developments with Lido’s Simple DVT module, and the numbers are impressive. Just recently, the module hit 2,250 validators and over 72,000 ETH staked, surpassing its initial 0.5% share limit, as noted by u/LidoFinance. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) now powers around 0.75% of the entire Lido protocol. What’s even more interesting is how these DVT clusters are outperforming 8 out of the top 10 staking entities, according to u/ratedw3b.

This got me thinking: What does this mean for the future of Ethereum staking? 🤔

For one, the decentralization of staking is clearly on the rise. DVT allows for a more robust and fault-tolerant staking infrastructure, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure. Projects like SSV Network and Obol Collective are really pushing the envelope here, making Ethereum staking more accessible and secure for both solo and community stakers. It’s awesome to see over 140 new solo and community stakers becoming node operators via DVT—this is a huge step toward decentralization.

But it also raises a bigger question: Could DVT be the key to breaking the dominance of large staking pools and making Ethereum more decentralized at the protocol level? 🤔

SSV Network, in particular, has been at the forefront of this movement. By enabling secure and distributed validator setups, they are changing the game for both small-scale stakers and large operators. I can’t help but wonder how this will impact the wider Ethereum ecosystem, especially as staking becomes more fragmented and democratized.

Would love to hear what you all think—are we on the verge of a decentralization revolution in Ethereum staking, or is it too early to tell? ",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum,Domain Registrar Based on Smart Contracts,2024-10-17 17:05:22,"# Project Concept

We propose creating a new type of domain registrar that uses smart contracts instead of traditional accounts to determine domain management rights.

# How It Works

1. When transferring a domain to this registrar, functions in the smart contract are called to add the new domain.
2. The address of the smart contract that has the rights to sign changes related to this domain is specified.

# Advantages

1. **Decentralized Management:** Domains do not depend on an individual's email.
2. **Flexible Management:** Ability to use multi-signature or DAO voting for decisions on DNS record changes.
3. **Security:** Use of cryptographic protection methods instead of passwords.
4. **Transparency:** All changes are recorded on the blockchain.

# Technical Implementation

1. **Integration with Existing DNS:** The service functions as a regular centralized registrar, fully compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure.
2. **Support for Popular Domains:** Ability to transfer and manage top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.).
3. **Auto-Renewal:** The system automatically renews domain registration by deducting funds from the smart contract.
4. **Open Balance Top-Up:** Any user can top up the contract balance for a specific domain without the need for authorization.

# Potential Applications

* For DAO projects
* For collaborative business projects
* For personal use (using a wallet instead of email for ownership confirmation)

# Questions for the Community

1. If such a project were implemented and announced by one of the top 10 existing domain registrars, would you use it for your new project?
2. Would you consider using this service for your personal domains?
3. What additional features would you like to see in such a service?
4. How do you assess the potential of this technology for managing digital assets in the future?",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,ethereum,"Ethereum Staking| Data on Staked ETH Share, Validators, Trends, Top Staking Pools | Oct 2024",2024-10-16 08:47:08,"Ethereum has been proof of stake chain for two years now. As a reminder the start of the transition to proof of stake started back in December 2020. The staking chain was launched then to run in parallel with the proof of work chain. Staking was then enabled, but withdrawals from staking were not. The proof of work chain and the proof of stake merged in September 2022, almost two years after the initial phase. Finaly unstaking was enabled in March 2023, when everyone who had staked on the PoS chain could unstake if they wish so.

How is staking Ethereum going these days? After everything was finished and time has passed. Are more users unstaking or maybe staking now? It’s been a year since the unstaking is live so let’s check it out.

Reddit,ethereum,Constellation is Live! Help scale Rocket Pool and support decentralized node operators!,2024-10-16 00:53:10,"Hi r/ethereum, I’m one of the co-founders of NodeSet, the developer of [Constellation](https://nodeset.medium.com/project-hyperdrive-4819f22391dc), a “Layer 2” staking protocol built on top of Rocket Pool! 

The main innovations of Constellation are xrETH, a liquid ETH staking token with ZERO fees on Ethereum staking rewards (including MEV), and xRPL, a liquid staking token for RPL. Gravita is launching the first public Constellation deployment on mainnet today, and [minting these tokens is now available via the Gravita website!](https://app.gravitaprotocol.com/constellation/xreth)

Once minted, the Constellation contracts non-custodially distribute the assets among NodeSet’s hundreds of decentralized operators, funding the operator bond (currently 8 ETH + 2.4 ETH or RPL) and unlocking their ability to deploy RP validators at scale.

We’ve spent the last 18+ months building both a robust (250+) and vetted cohort of independent node operators, including solo stakers, Rocket Pool operators, and small staking businesses. NodeSet’s mission is to connect the long-tail of decentralized operators that make Ethereum the most credibly neutral settlement layer in the world to compute opportunities across the ecosystem. Constellation, our first major project, supports the protocol that got us started on our journey as a company, Rocket Pool. Over the last year, RP has faced scaling challenges due to its bonding requirements, which has resulted in contraction of the protocol. Constellation was designed to alleviate those challenges while improving Rocket Pool’s underlying asset distribution. With nearly 40,000 ETH sitting in the rETH deposit pool, it’s time to unleash Constellation and grow Ethereum’s most decentralized liquid staking protocol! 

For those interested in diving deeper into the technology, please [take a look at the Constellation documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation). There’s a lot of work remaining, but we will be adding more information over the coming weeks, and [the GPLv3 code is available on our GitHub](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation), of course. On the security side, we recently [concluded three audits from some of the best in the business](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation/tree/main/audits) like Chainsafe and Sigma Prime, and [our bug bounty program details are located in the documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation/security-information).

Reddit,ethereum,Upsides and Downsides of Lowering Ethereum's Solo Staking Requirement?,2024-10-15 12:29:21,"The current solo staking system is for rich people. Most of us here dont have 32 ETH. Right now 32 ETH is $82 700 - only those with deep pockets can become validators because thats not even life savings for the average person. This of course excludes many average investors from helping secure the network directly

Vitalik posted yesterday in his blog the idea of dropping the staking requirement - He said as low as 1 ETH

Quoting:

>Ideally, we want to preserve economic finality, while simultaneously improving on the status quo in two areas:

>1 Finalize blocks in one slot (ideally, keep or even reduce the current length of 12s), instead of 15 min

>2 Allow validators to stake with 1 ETH (down from 32 ETH)

As someone who wishes to become a validator I think this is good and bad. Making staking accessible to more people would pump participation and decentralization - But is this ideal???

The first downside is the impact on yields - With more validators joining rewards would decrease by a lot - making solo staking less profitable. This would also dilute the incentives for maintaining nodes - which could result in less security if validators lose interest because of the lower returns. On the flip side decentralization would increase with more people participating - not just whales. There would be less reliance on staking pools - Lido for example

More participants means a more resilient network but this is at the cost of validator quality and security

The staking requirement should drop a little so it gives smaller investors a chance - not just the rich - but it should be something higher like 10 ETH. This way the network wouldnt be trading validator rewards for participation and decentralization and security would be maintained and the yields wouldnt be so low",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/)

* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups.

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out.

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

I’ve been Putting money in Bitcoin only for almost 2 years. I know I’m late. But recently - July”ish” I got tired of always seeing BTC stay at 58k!!! My average cost was slowly creeping up so I drank the memecoin koolaid!  Went pretty hard (on Base primarily) didn’t sell any BTC but began diverting my funds to the likes of Brett, Toshi, Mr. Miggles, Peezy, and a few others in hopes of quick gains!  How wrong I was!  Last week EVERY SINGLE meme had cost me big (Mister effin Miggles about 90%).  I also lost  total focus,  checking the memecoin prices constantly, listening to YouTuber tell me they were all getting ready to 1000x!  So last week I said f it and I swapped all memecoin shit back into BTC.  All at moderate to tremendous losses but I don’t give a shit.  I thought I’d regret it and not even for a second . Soon a I swapped my mental attitude improved 1000x!!! I don’t even look at the memes anymore.   I know BTC has gained since I swapped (and my prior memes are all down!!). Again though - I don’t care about the 1 week gains from swapping.   Memes weee trashing me, my wallet, and my mentality.   Lesson learned.  I’m back to BTC and BTC only!!!

Reddit,bitcoin,London Satoshi reveal unsurprisingly fails to convince anyone of his identity amid fraud charges,2024-10-31 15:50:10,"What a loser. Unsurprisingly really. 

>At a press conference in London on Oct. 31, Stephen Mollah declared himself to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin but failed to provide compelling evidence to support his claim. The event at the Frontline Club left attendees skeptical as technical issues and unverified assertions undermined his credibility.

>Joe Tidy, a cyber correspondent at BBC News, was one of few people who attended the event and reported that organizer Charles Anderson opened the conference, noting he had slept only two hours in the past 48 hours due to global interest since announcing the event.

>He also claimed to have invented energy recovery systems in cars and created the television show “Britain’s Got Talent.” A representative from the Frontline Club interrupted to clarify that the event was neither affiliated with nor endorsed by the venue, prompting at least one reporter to leave.

>When Mollah took the stage, technical difficulties prevented him from using his laptop for a live demonstration. Proceeding without it, he described himself as an economic and monetary scientist and recounted previous attempts to reveal his identity. He claimed that efforts to disclose his identity in 2016 were thwarted and mentioned an alleged interview with the BBC’s Rory Cellan-Jones that was never published.

>Journalists grew impatient with Mollah’s lengthy narrative and pressed for concrete evidence. According to Tidy, Mollah presented “a series of easy to fake screenshots.” When asked if he would move bitcoins from the Genesis block or provide cryptographic proof, Mollah stated he would do so in the next few months. This response failed to satisfy the audience, and many began to exit.

>“As Mr. Mollah’s cheek twitched rapidly, he faced a skeptical crowd demanding proof,” Tidy reported.

>“I asked if he will move some of the Genesis bitcoins to finally prove he is Satoshi. He said he will in the next few months. I have left the conference.”

>Arthur van Pelt, a strong critic of another person who falsely claimed to be Satoshi, Craig Wright, commented,

>“Again no signing, also can’t code in C++, but… over 1,000 less forgeries as Craig Wright, I’ll give him that.”

>The press conference had been announced the previous day through a press release by PR London Live. The release promised that Nakamoto would reveal his legal identity due to “growing legal pressures.” The release claimed that a live demonstration would provide “verifiable proof” of his identity, marking “the most significant moment in the history of cryptocurrency.” However, the event failed to deliver on these assurances.

>Further, the ‘legal’ issues mentioned in the press release may be to do with recent fraud charges against the organizers as db reported,

>“The organizer of this event and ‘Satoshi’ were recently released on bail after being charged with fraud for… posing as Satoshi 💀

>Mr Anderson (organizer) and Stephen Mollah (Satoshi larp) appear to have been at this for years, teasing announcements and bitcoin 2.0 projects.”

>Over the years, several individuals have professed to be Satoshi Nakamoto but have not provided definitive proof. The most conclusive way to verify such a claim involves moving bitcoins from addresses known to belong to Satoshi or providing cryptographic signatures associated with the original Bitcoin software. Mollah’s inability to produce such evidence means this is, unsurprisingly, another Satoshi scam.

Reddit,bitcoin,Help Finding Deleted Michael Saylor Video with Graphics on Bitcoin’s Energy Efficiency (Tucker Carlson Interview),2024-11-01 00:10:26,"Hi everyone,

I’m trying to locate a specific Michael Saylor video that was originally posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account. This video paraphrased some of his usual talking points about Bitcoin’s efficiency, including the memorable line about how “you can send $1 million (or a billion dollars) across the world for a nickel.”

What made this video unique was its presentation style—it looked like it came from his Tucker Carlson interview, but Saylor was green-screened over visuals that illustrated his points. I believe this was created by his marketing team to make these concepts clearer, and it was honestly my favorite “orange pill” video to send to people new to Bitcoin.

Since the original tweet has been deleted, I haven’t been able to find this specific version anywhere else. If anyone has a link, knows where it might have been reposted, or saved a copy, I’d really appreciate the help!

The necessity as concluded in the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto is **""We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust""**

The scarcity of 50 BTC initial block reward isn't defined in the Bitcoin white paper, **The 50 BTC initial reward was defined in the original Bitcoin source code.**

The 21 million limit is derived from:

1. The initial block reward of 50 BTC
2. The halving interval every 210,000 blocks (roughly every 4 years)
3. The mathematical formula in the source code that controls this

**50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + ... = 21,000,000**

The Genesis Block (Block #0) also demonstrates this implementation with its 50 BTC reward. This block was mined on January 3, 2009, and contains the famous Times headline ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.""

A patient, pale from FOMO, enters grim,
“I’m down twenty thousand, Doc, I’m sunk!
I bought the dip, but now my hopes are slim—
These shitcoins tanked, they’re nothing but pure junk!”

The doctor shakes his head, “An age-old tale,
You chase the flash, but end with empty hands.
The orange pill will help you to prevail—
Bitcoin’s your savior, ditch those other brands.”

“But Doc, the memes! The pumps, they’re quick and bold!
How can I sit with Bitcoin slow and still?”
“FOMO no more, just HODL, strong and cold,
The shitcoins fail, but BTC will thrill.”

Yet off he goes, to gamble one more spin,
Ignoring wisdom for the next quick win.

If I open a new (second) wallet on say the desktop in Sparrow and store the keys on my connected Jade, it appears to still wind up being stored in Sparrow on the desktop.  When I plug in the Jade to the laptop and open Sparrow, the new wallet doesn't show up when trying to import it. But for some reason the original (1st) wallet is available to import.  So if my desktop crashes, the new wallet is lost.  And if I store any BTC on the new wallet, I can't access it by plugging the Jade into a different computer.  Even though I created it with the keys supposedly stored on the Jade.  What I don't get is this didn't happen with the 1st wallet I created.  That one is on the Jade, and can be imported to a different computer.  

Has anyone run into this?  What am I doing wrong?  How do I ensure that all my wallets will show up using the Jade on any computer?

I'm aware this question has been asked several times but I can't get a clear answer...

I'm currently employed full time in the UK and don't have any other source of income therefore I don't currently submit a self assessment.

I have started trading crypto last year (from August 2023) and have made a small profit when closing positions to move platform. (circa £500)

My total gains for 23/24 tax year are less than the tax-free allowance of £6000 therefore I understand I don't need to pay capital gain tax.

The question is: Do I still need to register for self assessment and report those gains?

\* the total amount I sold the assets for was less than £50,000 (circa £2000)

\*the total amount I sold the assets for was less than 4 times your allowance

[Bitcoin ROI After Halving](https://preview.redd.it/nm66vii2c6yd1.png?width=2122&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0d1511d50e75b33372e015e1b25f485d402f832)

The most surprising part of all this is that it comes in the wake of the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Reports of record-breaking daily inflows are common, yet price is only up 52% since the launch of the ETFs on January 11th.  That's not a lot relative to previous halving years.

This week alone saw a new record inflow, yet somehow it was met with a near equal amount of selling... I'm not getting out my tin foil hat just yet, but it does seem suspicious that every massive inflow (buying) it is met with a massive outflow (selling). 

That's not normal for Bitcoin if you look at previous years. There is usually a supply shock and rapid price increase, especially at these record-breaking levels of inflows. 

Yes, I realize that most of it is done OTC, but that's always been the case. How does one explain the current stunted price action in light of previous cycles? It's not possible that retail could be selling this much.

We've seen people say it was a bad investment, that MicroStrategy was going to fail, and million other things, while they never cared and kept buying. They've doubled their money into $18 billion by purely DCAing and holding.


And we have no idea how high Bitcoin will keep going, as it's just getting started, and their profits might become even more.


Both MicroStrategy and El Salvador have made crazy amount of gains while both were criticised for their decision initially.


And the first few days of October had everyone thinking we won't get anywhere near the ATH, but it seems the market doesn't really care about TAs and what we think.

If you were going to invest today and pull out everything in roughly 6 months, would you go into BTC or ETH? Those are the only two I’m interested in investing in and I just want somewhere to put my cash until I use it for a purchase in 6 months. ETH is much further from its all time high, but BTC tends to be king until alt season comes around (if that even happens this time around) so I’m wondering… would you guys choose BTC or ETH in this scenario?

***""*** *-* **Today, the crypto industry is developing rapidly, and with each new project, various marketing strategies emerge. Some use aggressive marketing that attracts a large audience and often creates excessive hype. However, it’s becoming increasingly more work for users to distinguish up-and-coming projects from those that rely solely on hype. How can users in the crypto industry avoid being influenced by aggressive marketing and approach investments rationally? What advice would you give to avoid falling for the hype surrounding ‘shitcoins’ and make informed decisions?**

*To avoid falling for aggressive marketing tactics in the crypto industry, users need to adopt a more critical, research-driven approach. First, they should focus on project fundamentals, examining elements like the team’s background, the project’s real-world applications, and its long-term vision. Users should also look for comprehensive white papers and clear roadmaps indicating a project’s commitment to transparency.*

*To avoid ‘shitcoins’ or projects based solely on hype, I advise investors to prioritise projects with robust utility, focusing on those that solve genuine problems within the industry. They can avoid impulsive decisions by setting clear investment criteria based on personal risk tolerance and joining communities to discuss and evaluate potential investments with like-minded individuals.""*

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The greatest attribute of Crypto is that it encourages people to question Fiat. Particularly when Central Banks are paving the way for CBDC's without any political mandate. ,2024-10-29 15:06:14,"When I first discovered Bitcoin I was a cynic and didn't mine/ buy any. However I was immediately fixated by it and the debate surrounding it. For the first time in my life I was starting to ask questions of the central bank paper notes and coins I had always known, but never questioned.

Back then this wasn't normal behaviour. One did not question money, one just did what they could to accumulate as much as they could. ""*Have you ever questioned what that note actually means?*"" I'd find myself blurting out in public. Only to be met with looks of ""*what the fuck you on about you fucking nutter*?"". 

At that point, it wasn't so much I'd found Bitcoin, rather I was finding out the bleak reality of the Fiat money I had never thought to question. This wasn't an opt in form of money with finite supply, but a currency I was forced to accept as legal tender with limitless supply. One that had been underpinned by gold under the Bretton Woods system until 1971 when the United States ended the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. 

At school, money often featured in education. How to count it, how it been used throughout history, how it was made... but never what it actually was, what stood for or what gave it value. Today when I zoom out on opinion it isn't Bitcoin or indeed any crypto isn't actually the most important thing, rather for the first time I history it's the swell of people now starting question the currency governments legally force them to use. 

Without any direct political mandate and without citizens being directly asked iglobal central banks are paving the way to launch central bank digital currencies. Preliminary public consultation on CBDC's is often non-existent or extremely limited. Historically, the way democracy is undermined by governments is by early/ muted announcement with little immediate action, using the passage of time to condition the public into thinking it's already been accepted by society before they gradually take action to phasing it in. This is exactly what's happening with CBDC's today. 

Global central banks do not have a mandate from the people to spend time and resources paving the way for Central Bank Digital Currencies... and yet they continue. These are digital currencies you will legally be forced to use and yet the vast majority of world are excluded from any conversation on them. In what could be one of the biggest changes to Fiat money for centuries citizens of any democratic society should have a voice. The fact they disproportionately don't should be a major red flag.

Crypto proponents had the right to optimistic in the same way crypto cynics have the right to be cynical. Open source development, code repositories, public/ decentralised blockchains and ultimately the option to opt in/ out in the free market is about as fair as any form of digital money can get. CBDC's not only won't offer this, currently there's no political mandate central banks should be looking at them at all.

**TLDR**

If nothing else, crypto has society asking tough questions of fiat money for the first time in decades if not centuries. Questions that we never thought to ask, rarely knew or were never taught. It has us questioning the extent of our freedom, the role of central banks and value of legal tender. This is important as (without any direct political mandate) governments and central banks conspire to roll out fiat 2.0 in the form of CBDC's largely without it citizens ever being asked. 

**Federal Reserve**: [we have been exploring the potential benefits and risks of CBDCs from a variety of angles, including through technological research and experimentation. Our key focus is on whether and how a CBDC could improve on an already safe and efficient U.S. domestic payments system.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm)

**European Central Bank**: [We are working with the national central banks of the euro area to look into the possible issuance of a digital euro. It would be a central bank digital currency, an electronic equivalent to cash. And it would complement banknotes and coins, giving people an additional choice about how to pay.](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/html/index.en.html)

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

NOTE = I don't know if I'll release the code on github, surely at the moment it's a bit messy :P",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531

Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Reddit,crypto,How far into mathematics should I for a CS PhD in Cryptography?,2024-08-18 09:32:40,"I'm a joint math and cs major heavily considering a PhD in Computer Science following my graduation with a focus on cryptography. I've taken:

* mathematical cryptography
* complexity theory cryptography
* galois theory
* abstract algebra
* complex analysis
* representation theory
* statistics 1
* complexity theory
* algorithm analysis/design
* real analysis I/II
* topology
* a bunch of other low-level cs courses (os, networks, distributed systems, applied cryptography, security etc)

Here are my two options for the future:

* Take Category Theory, Homological Algebra, Automorphic Forms, Analytical Number Theory (mathy path) (can swap automorphic forms/analytical number theory for two seminars in algebraic geometry)
* Take High-Performance Computation, Multiprocessor Synchronization, Distributed Systems, and Machine Learning (cs path)

I'm interested in fully homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Which path would serve me better?",2024-11-01 00:56:37.993531
