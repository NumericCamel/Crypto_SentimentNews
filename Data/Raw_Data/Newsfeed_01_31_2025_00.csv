Ethereum MVRV Momentum Has Witnessed A Bearish Crossover As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has declined under its 160-day moving average (MA) recently. The “MVRV Ratio” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here is a capitalization model that calculates ETH’s total valuation by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin MPI Crossover Could Suggest Bull Run Still On Since the last transaction of any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, the Realized Cap essentially measures the sum of the cost basis of the circulating supply. This model could also be looked at as a representation of the amount of capital the investors as whole have put into Ethereum. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying right now. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the realized cap. Such a trend implies the investors as a whole are sitting on unrealized gains. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark suggests the holders are carrying a lower value than they initially put in, so the average investor could be considered underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV Ratio, as well as its 160-day MA, over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has registered a decline recently as ETH’s price has followed a bearish trajectory. The indicator is still above the 1 mark after this drawdown, suggesting the overall market remains in the green. The metric’s fall, however, has meant that it has slipped under its 160-day MA. The combination of the indicator’s daily value and its 160-day is known as the MVRV Momentum. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time the MVRV Momentum showed a similar pattern as recently. Related Reading: $54 Million In Dogecoin Exits Binance As Price Crashes 9%: Sign Of Buying? It would appear that the MVRV Ratio crossing under its 160-day MA led to a 40% price correction for Ethereum last year. It now remains to be seen whether the negative momentum in the indicator would also prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency this time as well or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,200, up more than 2% over the last seven days.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $4 Billion Again After Market Rebound,2025-01-30 23:00:09+00:00,"The crypto market is back up again after a recent decline like clockwork, and prices are starting to push up once more. Interestingly, this renewed momentum has seen Dogecoin open interest flipping from a negative threshold into a positive one. As the meme coin’s price gains traction, traders are once again pouring into derivatives markets, pushing the total open interest above $4 billion. Dogecoin Open Interest Surges With Market Revival According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin’s total open interest has climbed back above the $4 billion mark, indicating a resurgence in trading activity. This comes after the Dogecoin price rebounded on the $0.31 multi-year support again and started its move upwards again. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Explodes Ahead Of Donald Trump Inauguration, Traders Bet On $1 Interestingly, data from Coinglass show that the Dogecoin open interest has increased by 3.11% and 2.09% in the past 24 hours and 4 hours, respectively. This shift suggests that traders are once again looking at Dogecoin as a promising asset for leveraged plays, betting on further price movements. The most notable DOGE open interest is on the Gate.io exchange, which has seen an increase of 5.14% in the past 24 hours. This brings its total open interest to $1.64 billion, accounting for 41% of the total rate. Bitget and BingX have also witnessed notable uptrends, with the Dogecoin open interest growing by 6.41% and 6.67%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. Binance, on the other hand, is yet to flip into positive open interest change. The world’s largest crypto exchange is still on a -0.13% open interest rate in the past 24 hours but is also on the verge of a positive rate with a +1.41% increase in the last four hours. Increased Leverage Could Lead To More Price Volatility A rise in open interest means that more traders are opening leveraged positions, which could amplify price swings in either direction. Interestingly, Dogecoin often experiences strong price movements during periods of increase in open interest. This latest increase alone means that there is an increase in market participation in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weekly RSI Approaches The MA Line, Can Price Resume Uptrend To Break $0.74 ATH? If bullish sentiment continues, this market participation may drive the Dogecoin price further upward within the $0.30 to $0.4 range in the short term. However, it also raises the possibility of more liquidations if Dogecoin were to retest support at $0.31 again. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3316, marking a 7% gain since bouncing off its multi-week support at $0.31. The next step for the meme coin is breaking above a recently developed daily candlestick resistance at $0.3316, which could then pave the way for further upside momentum if sustained buying pressure continues.

Tech Giants Show Resilience Amid DeepSeek Scare Major US technology stocks remained surprisingly resilient during the uncertainty within the cryptocurrency space. Companies such as Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon were able to bounce back strongly. Their recovery was a stark contrast to the crypto market’s struggles. The divergence between traditional tech and digital assets was apparent throughout the trading session. Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs Face Massive Withdrawals The turbulence was particularly challenging for cryptocurrency investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which had thrived with inflows amounting to nearly $2 billion in the week following Donald Trump’s second term launch, sharply reversed. Farside Investors reported that this saw the product see outflows of $457.6 million. Still, this was not better for Ethereum ETFs, which lost $136.2 million.

Large companies like Riot Platforms, Cleanspark, and MARA Holdings all recorded losses for the second day running. Their troubles reflected the greater instability in the market. According to CoinMarketCap, the global cryptocurrency market lost nearly a percent in value in the last 24 hours. Total ETP outflows exceeded $534 million during the crypto market’s stunning one-day sell-off, which rattled investor confidence.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Outflows Signal Bullish Strength As Demand Remains High At $100K – What This Means,2025-01-30 20:00:11+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen an impressive 8% surge since Monday, solidifying $100K as a strong support level. After weeks of volatility and uncertainty, BTC has now reclaimed key levels and is pushing toward an all-time high (ATH) retest. Investors and analysts alike are closely watching Bitcoin’s next move, as bullish momentum continues to build. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Setting For A Massive Leg Higher – Analyst Sees Bullish Consolidation Above Key Level Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights revealing that Bitcoin continues to flow out of exchanges, a sign that long-term holders are accumulating. This trend is reducing available supply, which historically has been a key driver for price appreciation in bull cycles. With fewer BTC available for trading, demand pressure could accelerate, potentially fueling a breakout into price discovery. Now that Bitcoin has regained critical resistance levels, traders are eyeing a push above ATH, which would confirm the next major leg of the bull run. However, market participants remain cautious, as BTC must hold above key levels to sustain its uptrend. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can continue its climb or enter another consolidation phase before making a decisive move. Bitcoin Holds Strong Above $105K Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced high volatility in recent weeks, yet strong price action continues to defy negative market sentiment. After testing key support levels, BTC is now trading above $105K, showing resilience as it looks ready to push above all-time highs (ATH). Investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, with many expecting a bullish year ahead. Related Reading: Solana ‘Still Wants Lower’ As Meme Coins Face A Major Shakeout – Analyst Yesterday’s Federal Reserve meeting added to the positive market sentiment, giving BTC the momentum needed to shift back into an upward trajectory. With institutional and retail demand rising, Bitcoin remains the leading asset poised for another breakout. Crypto expert Axel Adler shared valuable insights on X, highlighting that a negative Netflow-to-Reserve ratio is a bullish signal. He pointed out that the largest BTC outflow from exchanges occurred at the Bear Market bottom in January 2023, marking strong buying activity and the first accumulation phase of the bull cycle. In 2024, peak buying activity was observed at the $100K level, reinforcing strong demand despite a slight decline in volume. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin continues to flow out of exchanges, reducing supply and fueling further price appreciation. If demand remains strong, BTC could soon break into price discovery, setting the stage for new all-time highs. BTC Testing Last Resistance Below ATH Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $105,200, showing strong momentum as it inches closer to a breakout above all-time highs. The next key level to clear is $106K, which could trigger a move toward the highly anticipated $110K mark. If BTC pushes past ATH with conviction, it would confirm a bullish breakout, setting the stage for further price discovery. However, bulls must defend the $103,600 level to sustain the uptrend. This price zone has been a critical support, holding Bitcoin in a bullish structure. Losing this level could signal short-term weakness, potentially sending BTC back to test the $100K mark. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 450 Million DOGE During Recent Price Dip – Time For A Breakout? For now, Bitcoin’s price action remains strong, and as long as $103,600 holds, momentum should continue to favor the bulls.

The coming days will be crucial, as traders watch for a confirmed breakout or a potential retest of key support levels. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Fund CIO Explores New Market Reality Ross Ulbricht received 50% of the total supply of these tokens, which were designed to generate financial support in the wake of his pardon. Instead of liquidating his holdings all at once, he sought to add liquidity gradually on Raydium, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Solana blockchain. However, Ulbricht’s attempt to provide liquidity was marred by a critical error. In setting up the liquidity pool, he mistakenly utilized a Constant-Product Market Maker (CPMM) model instead of the more refined Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) model.  The CPMM model, which is the standard for automated market makers, does not allow liquidity providers to set specific price ranges for their trades. As a result, Ulbricht’s tokens became available for trading at an unfavorable price, leading to immediate and unintended market consequences. ROSS Tokens Plunge 90% After MEV Exploitation This misconfiguration attracted the attention of a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot—an algorithm designed to scan blockchain transactions for profitable opportunities and execute trades at lightning speed.  The bot seized the moment, purchasing $1.5 million worth of ROSS tokens at a steep discount, then promptly reselling them at a profit into the existing liquidity pool. The rapid exploitation of the mispriced tokens caused a significant price drop, triggering a cascade of losses. In an effort to rectify the situation, Ross Ulbricht attempted to fix his liquidity setup but fell into the same trap, ultimately losing an additional $10.5 million. This brought his total losses to a staggering $12 million as the MEV bot continued to exploit the misconfigured liquidity.  The fallout from these transactions resulted in a 90% crash in the token’s price, eroding a significant portion of its market value. Related Reading: Solana Restested A Key Level And Now Faces Resistance – Breakout Next? Despite these setbacks, Ross Ulbricht retains 10% of the ROSS token supply in another wallet, now correctly configured on Raydium’s CLMM pools. These remaining holdings are estimated to be worth around $200,000, a mere fraction of the original investment. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Price Forms Falling Wedge Pattern On 1-Day Chart That Suggests 20% Rally Is Coming,2025-01-30 18:30:37+00:00,"Ethereum’s price action is showing signs of an impending breakout as it moves back and forth within a falling wedge pattern on the daily candlestick time frame chart. According to an analysis first posted on the TradingView platform, this formation is a strong bullish signal that could push the Ethereum price toward $3,800 if history repeats itself.  The falling wedge, which is generally known to be a bullish price action structure, is developing between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for Ethereum, in line with a similar pattern from that preceded an Ethereum price rally last year. Ethereum Repeating Falling Wedge Pattern Ethereum has largely underperformed this cycle without any clear breakout yet. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency has yet to recover towards its 2021 all-time high unlike many of its other crypto counterparts with large market caps.  Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With Rising Channel Pattern Technical analysis of the current Ethereum price action shows that the leading altcoin has been trading in a decline since the beginning of the year. This decline has been characterized by the formation of lower highs and lower lows, which is quite like a falling wedge pattern. What’s very interesting is that this wedge pattern on the Ethereum price chart is developing between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which makes it even more peculiar. The TradingView analyst highlighted that the current falling wedge price structure mirrors the March 2024 pattern, which saw Ethereum forming a triple bottom before breaking out and reaching the 0.786 Fibonacci extension level. If the same scenario unfolds, the current falling wedge could serve as a launchpad for a price surge towards a target at the $3,800 level. This represents a potential 20% upside from Ethereum’s current trading range. Resistance Levels Could Delay the Rally At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,180, up 1% in the past 24 hours. This marks a steady climb from the lower end of the wedge pattern, bringing the cryptocurrency closer to breaking above the upper trendline around $3,250.  Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish While the technical setup leans bullish after the predicted breakout, it is important to note that Ethereum faces a significant resistance hurdle between $3,400 and $3,500. Sellers positioned at this resistance zone have acted as a strong barrier in recent months, and they have successfully stalled previous attempts by the bulls to push higher. If Ethereum fails to break through the upper end of this range, another temporary rejection could occur before any sustained move toward $3,800. If Ethereum successfully clears the $3,500 resistance, it could pave the way for a more extended bullish trend, with $3,800 as the next logical target. Notably, this $3,800 target reflects a tempered outlook on Ethereum compared to past market expectations, a sentiment shaped by its recent price action. However, if strong bullish momentum builds toward $3,800, it could trigger an even larger push toward the $4,000 mark.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Must-See Crypto Charts: Analyst Reveals What You Can’t Afford To Miss,2025-01-30 17:00:17+00:00,"In a market breakdown shared on X, independent trader and Zero Complexity Trading founder Koroush Khaneghah points to a handful of critical crypto charts that he believes could dictate the next major market move. Khaneghah, who has invested in over 50 startups, emphasizes that the charts for BTC/USD, BTC Dominance (BTC.D), TOTAL2, ETH/BTC, and SOL/BTC provide invaluable insights into the crypto market’s current condition and possible future shifts. BTC/USD: Defining The Crypto Market Khaneghah identifies BTC/USD as the yardstick for gauging what stage of the bull run the market might be in. According to his view: “This decides what stage of the bull run we’re in. – Breaks above ATH resume the bull run – Consolidation below ATH -> Altcoins enter accumulation zones – Major structural breaks -> Time to turn bearish” He suggests traders begin by determining which of three market environments Bitcoin is in: a raging bull market, a consolidation phase, or a structural downturn. Currently, Khaneghah sees BTC/USD “ranging below all-time highs, coming off some major uptrends,” which often presents either a catch-up scenario for altcoins or a prolonged accumulation phase ahead of Bitcoin’s next attempt to break all-time highs. BTC Dominance (BTC.D) To clarify whether altcoins are poised for a significant move, Khaneghah turns to BTC Dominance. As he explains: “BTC.D (bitcoin dominance) tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. “Increasing Dominance = BTC outperforms and altcoins lag (same for upside and downside). Decreasing Dominance = BTC cools off and money flows into Altcoins.” Dominance rising typically means Bitcoin is absorbing the bulk of market liquidity. Meanwhile, a drop in BTC.D often suggests altcoins are about to see greater inflows of capital. Crypto Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin (TOTAL2) The TOTAL2 chart, which excludes Bitcoin from the total crypto market capitalization, is key to analyzing altcoin behavior. Khaneghah advises: “When BTC.D Falls, TOTAL2 increases because capital is rotating into altcoins. When TOTAL2 breaks out, look for longs on the strongest altcoins, rotate out of Bitcoin, and shift capital into alts again.” He stresses that the highest probability trades come from identifying moments when the market rotates away from Bitcoin. In these instances, traders might see stronger returns by entering altcoin positions rather than remaining primarily in BTC. ETH/BTC Khaneghah underscores that ETH/BTC is a helpful barometer for broader altcoin sentiment: “The best altcoin plays happen when ETH/BTC stops trending downwards because the market confidence in alts returns here.” When Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin or stabilizing against it, it generally sparks confidence that altcoins could experience rallies, often referred to as “altseason.” SOL/BTC Khaneghah also shines a spotlight on SOL/BTC, suggesting that Solana’s performance relative to Bitcoin could reshape altcoin capital rotation: “I don’t normally look at this but a comparison helps decide if the money rotation has a better reward within the SOL ecosystem or ETH. People will think SOL has ‘pumped already’ but I like buying coins with strength, rather than buying coins that might catch a bid.” While Solana has posted significant gains, Khaneghah believes its strong performance could continue. He notes that if Solana keeps outperforming Bitcoin, some capital might shift away from ETH, potentially amplifying activity across the SOL ecosystem. At press time, BTC traded at $105,026.

The venture, which is being called ‘a natural expansion of the Truth Social movement,’ will offer several investment options, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It’s also worth recalling how positively Trump’s previous crypto ventures impacted the market. For instance, the launch of $TRUMP was a blockbuster success, as the meme coin soared over 12,000% overnight. The meme coin became one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market capitalization almost immediately after its launch. Next, Donald Trump’s appointment of Scott Bessent, a pro-crypto billionaire hedge fund manager, as the new Treasury Secretary also saw BTC surge by around 2.5% on January 29 – and it’s up by over 1% today, too. Next, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) recently became a 0.1% holder of staked Ethereum, holding over $33M of it. Additionally, WLFI also holds over $256M worth of ETH, which makes up for nearly 65% of its ginormous $400M portfolio. Everything put together, it’s safe to say that Charles Schwab’s collaboration, too, will add fuel to the crypto rally. An extremely bullish crypto market that’s seemingly only getting started means that there are some wonderful early-stage opportunities. Here are the 5 best new crypto to invest in in 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Best New Crypto to Buy for 100x Return in 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is jam-packed with potential because it combines the OG Pepe meme’s appeal with exceptional utility. It has set out to abolish the dominance of crypto whales, who leverage insider information to manipulate the markets. This means that their wealth comes at the cost of small traders, who get trapped because of the manipulation. $WEPE token holders will get a wealth of tools, including trading strategies, unique market insights, real-time trading signals, and a lively community of retail traders, to be able to flip the script on institutional investors and trap them in their own game. It’s worth noting that the $WEPE presale has been one of the hottest crypto presales ever, raising close to $65M (and counting) in a little over just a month. The presale is in its last stage, as it’s set to wrap up in around 17 days from now. Visit the official Wall Street Pepe website and buy the next 100x meme coin for just $0.0003665. If you’re new to presales, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $WEPE. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Frist-Ever Layer 2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to solve the pain points of the Solana network, which, although super successful, has been plagued with issues like network congestion, transactions frequently failing, and limited scalability. Solana could, therefore, be a big reason behind Solana really taking off in the coming months. The Solaxy presale has been impressive, raising over $16M and attracting the interest of both retailers and whales. For instance, a whale bought $122K $SOLX at the end of December, and transactions of $67K and $50K were made very recently.  Interested investors can buy $SOLX at its current price of $0.00162. But keep in mind that a price increase is just around the corner (in less than 45 hours, to be precise), so hurry up!  3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Crypto Tackling Information Load MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a one-of-a-kind meme coin, seeing as it’s a self-evolving AI agent that aims to change the way people invest in the crypto economy. As the name suggests, this frog-inspired AI agent has a “MIND” of its own, and it continually learns through its interactions. What interactions, you ask? Well, MIND holds conversations with crypto influencers and communities on dApps and online platforms like X. It not only listens to and understands what’s being said but also analyses all the information to then filter out clear-cut and high-potential crypto investment advice for token holders. What’s more, it also has the power to drive conversations and ignite trends on these platforms. Early adopters can buy MIND of Pepe for just $0.0032273, plus they can also benefit from the project’s 506% staking rewards, which, in case you didn’t know, will only reduce as the presale moves onto its next stages. Here’s how to buy $MIND. 4. XRP ($XRP) – Excellent Crypto to Diversify Your Portfolio XRP aims to level the crypto playing field by reducing overreliance on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For instance, it has been urging the US government that the proposed national cryptocurrency reserve shouldn’t be Bitcoin-centric and should include other digital assets. After surging past the $3.150 mark, XRP’s price is now trading above $3.020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Combined with a bullish flag pattern and increased volume, it looks like XRP’s uptrend will continue. 5. Movement ($MOVE) – Get Behind Trump’s Crypto Footprints One of the smartest ways to thrive as a crypto investor is by following Trump’s investments. How? Look at where World Liberty Financial Holdings, Trump’s company, is investing its money. It very recently (on January 28, 2025) bought $1.88M worth of $MOVE, which is why the token features on our list. It’s worth noting that Movement is an ecosystem of Move-based blockchains that allows developers to build highly secure, performance-centric, and interoperable blockchain applications. Additionally, $MOVE has also broken out of its recent slumps, plus the community sentiment around it is overwhelmingly bullish, meaning it has great potential to rally upwards. It’s currently trading at $0.82. Conclusion With one pro-crypto administrative/regulatory change after another, there’s never been a better time to be a crypto investor than under the new Trump regime. If you’re looking for fresh, high-potential investment opportunities, the 5 new crypto mentioned above will not disappoint. However, it’s important to keep in mind that none of the above is financial advice. We merely offer our honest opinions and insights in an attempt to help both new and seasoned investors. Also, crypto investments are subject to market risks, and you must always DYOR (do your own research) before investing your hard-earned money.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Solana Restested A Key Level And Now Faces Resistance – Breakout Next?,2025-01-30 15:30:20+00:00,"Solana (SOL) has been navigating extreme volatility as the broader market shifted from bearish to bullish within hours yesterday. After experiencing a sharp 25% decline from its all-time high (ATH) in less than two weeks, SOL tested a crucial demand level and is now making an attempt to recover lost ground. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Setting For A Massive Leg Higher – Analyst Sees Bullish Consolidation Above Key Level Investors remain divided on whether Solana has bottomed or if another pullback is on the horizon. However, early signs suggest buyers are stepping in, defending key technical levels. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, noting that Solana has successfully retested the 25-day EMA and RSI midlevel, both of which have historically acted as strong support during bullish trends. Following this retest, SOL bounced straight into key resistance, signaling a potential reversal if bulls maintain momentum. For Solana to confirm its recovery, it must break above resistance and sustain its move higher. If successful, SOL could resume its bullish trend, potentially reclaiming recent highs. However, failure to break key levels could lead to further consolidation or even another leg down. The coming days will be crucial in determining Solana’s next major move. Solana Surges 8% As Market Reacts To Fed Meeting Solana has bounced back strongly, surging 8% from local lows on Wednesday as the entire market reacted positively to the Federal Reserve meeting. Investors and analysts are now shifting their focus to a bullish outlook, anticipating a strong performance for crypto throughout the year. With sentiment improving, SOL is once again positioning itself as a market leader, aiming to reclaim key price levels and push toward new highs. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana’s recent retest of the 25-day EMA and RSI midlevel, both of which have historically acted as crucial support zones. After confirming these levels, SOL bounced straight into key resistance, signaling a potential breakout if momentum continues. Jelle emphasized that for Solana to “look great again,” it must reclaim the $240 level. However, he also cautioned that “resistance is resistance” until a clear breakout occurs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 450 Million DOGE During Recent Price Dip – Time For A Breakout? As the broader market tries to push higher, Solana is leading the way with strong technical formations and renewed bullish momentum. If bulls successfully push past resistance, SOL could retest its all-time highs and enter price discovery once again. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether Solana confirms its next major uptrend. Solana Price Holds Strong at $240 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $240 after successfully testing the $220 level as support. The price appears ready to bounce, but key resistance levels must be reclaimed to confirm a short-term trend reversal. For bulls to maintain momentum, SOL must break above $240 and $260, two critical resistance zones that have capped upward movement in recent days. If Solana clears these levels with strength, a surge above all-time highs (ATH) will be imminent, setting the stage for price discovery. On the bearish side, losing the $220 mark would signal weakness, potentially leading to further downside and deeper consolidation. The broader market remains volatile, and SOL must hold above key support levels to sustain its bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Turns $100K Into Support – Ready To Rally Higher? For now, Solana remains well-positioned to push higher, but investors will be watching closely to see if it can reclaim resistance and confirm a breakout. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether SOL resumes its uptrend or faces another test of demand levels. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Altcoin Season Alert: Analyst Says December Surge Was The ‘Preview’, Don’t Miss The Movie",2025-01-30 14:00:05+00:00,"The crypto market is gearing up for an explosive altcoin season, which could see major cryptocurrencies skyrocket to new highs. After experiencing a surge in December, altcoins entered a correction, leaving their next move uncertain. However, Captain Faibik suggests that the recent pullback was merely a “trailer” for the main event, with February potentially marking the start of the next rally.  Bull Pennant Signals Altcoin Season Boom In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Captain Faibik suggested that the altcoin season may be well on its way, as market indicators like a recently formed Bull Pennant show positive signals that support this prediction. The analyst revealed that in early December 2024, the crypto market had experienced a significant uptrend before entering a deep correction phase. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Enters 140-Day Golden Window, What Does Bitcoin Dominance Have To Do With It? Captain Faibik said this decline was necessary as it allowed the market to cool off after significant gains. Usually, when a cryptocurrency experiences strong growth and a subsequent price drop, it tends to flush out weak hands in the market and reset overheated indicators. In the case of the crypto market, the pullback is seen as a healthy market reset that could set the stage for an even stronger uptrend. Moving on, the crypto analyst noted that the market’s correction is almost over, paving the way for the next bullish wave. He shared a chart representing the total crypto market capitalization excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on a 1-day time frame.  Currently, the crypto market’s price action is forming a Bull Pennant characterized by converging trendlines. A breakout from this bull pattern is anticipated, potentially leading to a $1.4 trillion market capitalization target for the broader crypto market.  The analyst has indicated that February could be a bullish month for altcoins if the Bull Pennant pattern breaks upwards. He warns investors to buy and hold their bags while waiting for this supposedly explosive altcoin season.  Historically, the altcoin season has seen cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin surge dramatically as investors’ interest and demand from BTC to other alternative coins. Ethereum typically leads this trend, as its growth often sparks rallies across the altcoin market. However, with ETH underperforming against all expectations, the possibility of a full-fledged altcoin season remains uncertain.  February To KickStart AltSeason Sharing a similar sentiment with the timeline of Captain Faibik’s prediction for the altcoin season, many analysts have speculated that this bullish trend is set to occur in February. Specifically, Crypto Rover, a prominent crypto analyst on X, announced that the altcoin season will begin in the next two days. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 The analyst shared a chart highlighting Ethereum’s historical monthly returns from 2016 to 2024. The column for February shows that ETH has performed massively during this time almost every year, with 2017 recording its most significant return of 48.09%. Based on this analysis, Crypto Rover suggests that February could signal a bullish period for altcoins, triggering the start of the highly anticipated altcoin season.

Reddit,solana,Meme Coins are effectively unregulated rig-able lotteries.,2025-01-30 06:09:52,"Do you agree?

Edit: For those of you asking if I’m new, I am new to meme coins. I’ve never seen any value. I am not new to crypto.

I’ve been in bitcoin since 2012 or so. I bought in because I worked as a cyber security engineer on an early ransomeware case. I ended up buying bitcoin to pay the ransom by meeting a guy off Craigslist to buy a few bitcoin to pay the ransom. Since I didn’t want to have to do this in the future I bought a few to hold as well. Not because I was investing in some crypto but because people have been hacking for years for fee, bitcoin allowed them to get paid. I saw that as a huge reason for a need of bitcoin. So while I didn’t think it would go up as much as it I’d, I certainly didn’t think it was going to go down so I felt ok buying a few thousand dollars worth (luckily I forgot about it and sold a few years later for an insane amount of money).

This is not what meme coins are. They’re not adding a new value. Eth added smart contracts that’s valuable. Solana added speed that’s also valuable. 

What exactly do meme coins add?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,solana,Does Solana have an “Admin Dashboard” by which the SOL Gods can eliminate a project at will?,2025-01-30 22:45:37,"Alex Becker put out a video yesterday in which he posited that ETH will eventually surpass SOL because SOL has an “admin dashboard” — meaning that, if the **powers that be** want to terminate a project on SOL, then they can do so with the push of a button. However on ETH this is not as directly possible. Hence, (according to Alex) ETH will be the go-to crypto token for future developers, who are skittish about government intervention.

**Is this claim warranted?**

Reddit,solana,"DexScreener API - Search endpoint only returns 30 pairs, any way to get more?",2025-01-30 22:30:51,"Hi everyone,

I'm working with the DexScreener API to monitor Solana/Raydium pairs, but I've run into a limitation. The search endpoint (`/latest/dex/search?q=raydium+solana`) only returns 30 pairs, while the web interface shows many more.

**What I've tried:**

- Using the search endpoint: `https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/search?q=raydium+solana`

- Attempted different queries and parameters

- Checked the API documentation

**What I need:**

- Access to all or at least more Solana/Raydium pairs

- Ability to monitor newly launched pairs

- Real-time or near real-time data

The web interface (dexscreener.com) shows many more pairs when using filters.

Has anyone found a way to get more than 30 pairs from the API? Or is there perhaps an alternative endpoint I should be using?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

**API Rate Limits (for reference):**

- Search endpoint: 300 requests/minute

- Other endpoints: Various limits between 60-300 requests/minute

Reddit,solana,Last month I lost it all on Solana now I make $800 a week on solana. Eff those meme coins,2025-01-31 00:51:41,"Solana offers numerous ways to generate income beyond trading meme coins. This guide walks you through sustainable, low-risk methods that allow you to earn $800+ per week, even if you're starting with little or no money.

Reddit,solana,Pump.fun potential beyond rug pulling?,2025-01-30 02:13:09,"I recently launched my own token on Pump.fun (yes, I am part of the problem :p) to experiment with crowdfunding for a documentary project I’m working on. It got me thinking—why do so many people dismiss the platform as just a pump-and-dump machine? of course that is what it is currently being used for...but it could also be used for legit use cases, ignoring the desperate pump and dumpers.

Could a platform like pump.fun be a real tool for raising funds? If you're upfront to your fans about holding a token and using profits to build something valuable, is that really a rug? Or is it just a way for early supporters and the creator to actually benefit?

Think about a small music band. I used to follow obscure artists—some blew up, some didn’t, but supporting them felt meaningful either way. Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invest in a band early and see your stake grow as they did? Even if you never cashed out, you'd still be part of something bigger.

I truly think people are missing something here. After using Pump.fun myself, I see how it could be a powerful way to fund creative projects. (My main contention being - If your community supports you, why would you ever want to rug them?)

Curious ... Am I off base, or is there potential here? 

I am considering using it as a way to support my documentary making on Youtube, because it is very costly to make them - I feel like it could be a good alternative beyond Patreon - But I wanted to get actual feedback from people who are closer/more knowledgeable than I am.

Wether you know something like it that already exists, think its a great idea, think it's a shite idea, want to team up or steal the idea, all feedback is welcome.

So having been involved in a number of Memecoin CTOs there is often a call for the community to donate a small amount of SOL to a donation/marketing wallet that can be used to promote the project, pay for DEX etc. The issue is no one trusts anyone so deciding whose wallet the contributions go to is always a challenge.

The idea is to have a dApp that has a wallet that has funds that can only be released by a majority vote made by all contributors (possibly weighted by your contribution size). So as an example, we raise 5 SOL for a trending placement, but in order to release that 5 SOL all contributors need to agree.

Reddit,solana,Launching my own coin & on chain programs - US legality?,2025-01-30 21:09:24,"Hi all! Long time lurker but first time poster. I’ve been into blockchain tech since around 2014, but have never had time to really develop anything cool. I’ve been doing research into Solana and it seems easier to create your own tokens and it’s a hell of a lot faster and easier to build smart contracts (programs I know) on this chain then dealing with Solidity on Ethereum. 

I’ve had several ideas for tokens & programs that actually could do cool things. Stuff like some gamification and anchoring to real world events that offer tokens as rewards. I don’t want to launch coins that just screw people over, I’d rather make cool things that generate some revenue for me and other users. I’ve also been working for other companies for long enough and would love to start my own projects to help add some extra money for my family and friends. 

The documentation is pretty solid and rust is relativity straight forward. Before I get started, I was wondering what the “legality” of this stuff is? 

Many of you guys have coins you have created and are earning revenue. One of the few good things about the current administration is that they are very pro crypto and deregulatory - seems like the perfect time to start my projects.

Reddit,solana,Identify whether this is a bot or a human?,2025-01-30 18:13:34,"Hello, I've been doing some research to find and see some wallet's activity to see if I can use as a base to see what I should be looking for. The current wallet I found has about a 94% profitability but the transactions and activity don't really seem to be that of a bot. 

Based on the transaction activity, the operating hours of the wallet appear to be from 7:00 AM the earliest to about 8 PM the latest, which is a pretty normal time period for a human to be trading.  I've yet to see a transaction earlier or later than this time period. 

Also, the wallet makes very little transactions. The number ranges from 1-4 transactions daily. There are no sporadic number of transactions made, they are all early buys that are held and net amazing profits.

The amount of money invested isn't exorbitant or miniscule either. I've seen $400 on the bottom end to as much as $11,000. $11,000 is quite a lot, but in comparison to the profit the wallet has made, it's very small. 

The one confusing thing is that they seem to be a very very VERY early buyer in a coin, and most of the coins they purchasing range from 15x to 200x profits. 

Which pretty much concludes this wallet is a sniper but I'm unsure whether it's a bot or not and wanted to see what kind of bot and parameters could possibly net this kind of success. 

If anyone else has seen something like this and had any sort of insight, I would love to know. Thank you ",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Hi everyone, I hope anyone can bring me some help here. I posted on the Solana Stack exchange a few hours ago but my post was deleted without further notice.

To put it simply, I bought USDt on a CEX to send to my Cake wallet. Worked like a charm, everything is on my Cake wallet. Now the tough part is I've been trying for almost 24h to swap those USDt back to some other coins, but the app told me everytime I didn't have the funds.

After searching a lot (there really isn't a lot of easily accessible documentation about using Solana from a wallet !!) I understood I needed gas in SOL. I bought .03 SOL and send it to my account. That should do it for the fees right ?

Now I'm able to proceed further for the swap, but it still gives me an error, though a different one :

`Error processing instruction 0: invalid account data for instruction.`

I'm kinda lost. My address is a Token account, but it's really not clear if it should be or not, and I also have a non-Token address but I'm out of my depth here. At this point I regret using the SOL network at all for my USDt transfer, and I just want out as simply as possible. I have links to transactions if that's of any help.

Hope this is clear enough and if I can provide any useful data I will !

Cheers

Edit : clarity

Edit 2 : Deleted the term DEX as I in fact only use Cake wallet and Kraken. Just to avoid confusion from me using the wrong terms



**SOLUTION :**

I swapped all my USDt to SOL using **a proper Solana wallet (Solflare)** and it worked first try. In retrospect maybe it would have worked on Cake as well, and maybe it was only straight USDt to XMR that was impossible. Guess we'll never know.

  
So after swapping everything to SOL I was finally able to swap SOL to XMR using Cake again. It took like 5 attempts before I figured out the correct fee, which was **my balance minus 0.002005 SOL**, including the 0.002 for the rent and the 0.000005 for the transaction fee.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,solana,My coin dumped into nothing immediately after bonding,2025-01-29 00:59:40,"Can someone explain to me wtf just happened?

I launched a coin on pump with 3,5% supply as dev. Dipped in for 0.5% from a different wallet but that's it. Tied it up with a project I worked real hard on.

Within 20 seconds of launching it reached koth. 40 seconds, bonded.

I didn't know what to do... 4000 views on the site in those 40 seconds.

The second it bonded it dumped, hard. Way down to like 4.5k instantly which I would think is impossible even?

Later while reviewing, it seems one or two guys came in with 5,6 SOL each right after I did and just drained the whole supply the second it bonded.

Some people are still holding but it's a token with an X,  a site, and just a huge red line.

I tried to ask people from tg what happened but I get blocked immediately and called a rugger.

What the hell happened here, and how do I avoid it?

I launched some tokens before which made it quite far but I never had this happen. Was I lucky?

Reddit,solana,mSOL-SOL pool ... is this amazing or stupid?,2025-01-29 03:57:05,"This seems like an easy way to get \~5% extra yield on SOL beyond the \~12% current staking yield. Please check my logic.

Kamino's Raydium mSOL-SOL pool currently yields \~12%, but it's actually more like \~17% in terms of SOL. That's because roughly a third of the pool is a staking token (mSOL), which itself yields another \~12%. This accounts for a exaggerated estimate of 0.2% impermanent loss.

So it seems like an nice way to get some extra yield on SOL with relatively little added risk. Or is it?

I am not entirely sure, but I think I saw the pool's balance being 10% mSOL to 90% SOL the other day (today it's 36:64) That gets me concerned about IL if you need to withdraw at such a moment. I wish there was a way to check the historical pool balance so we could see how much it fluctuates.

Another concern is if only 10% of your share of the pool is mSOL, so you're not really getting much extra value from the staking rewards.

Is my logic right?

However on ETH this is not as directly possible. Hence, (according to Alex) ETH will be the go-to crypto token for future developers, who are skittish about government intervention.

**Is this claim warranted?**

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Let me know if you'd like me to help explore the RWA tokenization platforms and regulatory considerations for this type of real estate project.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Digging through I kinda understand the technical sides of things, however I am confused as to how Liquidity pools of DEX work.

Like the LP tokens received upon staking basically shows how much % a person has in a pool?

What can these LP tokens used for other than % stake?

 They can be traded like other Ethereum based tokens?

Also what would happen if a real large swap happens?

 Like all the tokens in a pool gets swapped and the pool becomes empty, how would I staking and stuff work then?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966
Reddit,ethereum,ETH Transfer Confirmed on Etherscan but Missing in Polymarket Account—Need Advice,2025-01-29 14:57:32,"Hey everyone,

I (along with several other users) am dealing with an issue where we accidentally sent ETH to Polymarket, which only accepts USDC. Unfortunately, the ETH never showed up in our Polymarket accounts, and their support has been unresponsive, closing tickets without resolving the issue.

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

# What I Need Help With:

1. Has anyone successfully recovered ETH sent to a platform that only accepts USDC?
2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?
4. Any strategies to escalate this issue publicly to get Polymarket’s attention?

Would really appreciate any advice from those with experience in handling misplaced crypto deposits! Thanks in advance.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

I have always sort of understood what they are but not completely. These other tokens on Ethereum like a gaming coin like axie infinity or any of the hot AI Coin’s are basically smart contracts that have been given their own tokens? 

Bitcoin and XRP have way smaller ecosystems because they don’t have smart contracts so they don’t have a reason to have all those tokens? 

If this is correct, are smart contracts always tokenized? Or are there smart contracts that can be carried out in Ethereum alone?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

They went to Bangalore for some meetup, conducted some meetups in my city and now they arr going to eth denver, one of them posted about the visa approval and tickets to the event. I was stunned. I talked to them and they have become literally so arrogant about giving information, and said they don't give a fuck to studies of college.

Reddit,ethereum,I've created a Game and hidden seed words throughout it.,2025-01-25 10:07:53,"Hi reddit, I challenge you all.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

We hope you love it and have a nice day. **�**�",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO.

(iv)   providing regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent decision making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries, all of which are essential to supporting a vibrant and inclusive digital economy and innovation in digital assets, permissionless blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies; and

(v)    taking measures to protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States, including by prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States.

It's mainly tokens that I tucked away. I think that I used my public key on MEW back then to see how they are doing etc. Today, can't find how to do it anymore!

Tried a few options but all are looking for wallets etc. I tried using a hardware device but it only brought up what I have on the device and not on the paper wallet.

Can anyone tell me the fastest way in 2025 to use my public key to see my tokens?

Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Blockchain Co-Founder for Nonprofit AI Language Startup (2000+ African Languages),2025-01-23 10:02:59,"**The Problem:**  
OpenAI, Meta, and Orange recently announced efforts to build AI for African languages. But here’s the catch: Africa has 2,000+ languages, many with little to no digital data. Without datasets, even the best AI models can’t bridge this gap.

**What We’re Doing:**  
We’re a nonprofit team building a blockchain and tokenomics-powered solution to crowdsource, validate, and incentivize the creation of African language datasets. Think decentralized data ownership, community-driven contributions, and equitable AI access.

**Who We Are:**

\- A team of **4 founders with 27+ combined years** in product development, startups, and AI/data systems.

\- Backgrounds: **AI engineer, Data Engineer, Statistician, Product Engineer, Non-profit and Funding**

\- Committed to impact over profit (**nonprofit structure**).

**We Need You:**

\- Blockchain/tokenomics expertise (Solana, Polygon, smart contracts, token design).

\- Technical enough to lead protocol development.

\- Aligned with the mission: Solve the data desert for African languages.

\- Comfortable with early-stage uncertainty (we’re pre-funding).

**No Fluff:**

\- This isn’t a “get rich quick” project, it is for the long haul. If you want hype, look elsewhere.

\- We’re not here to compete with OpenAI or any other AI war-lord—we’re solving the foundational problem they can’t ignore.

\- Remote work, no location preference.

**If This Resonates:**  
DM me with:

\- Your experience with blockchain projects

\- Why you would like to join us.

\- A brief intro about yourself

Let’s build something real.

P.S. Already working on African language datasets, blockchain for social impact, or decentralized AI? Let’s collaborate, not compete.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

$1800 in ETH straight up vanished 3 hours after I had received it and was sent to an unknown wallet. The $1800 in ETH came from a friend's coinbase and was sent directly to me. I've never bought anything on the Phantom wallet, I've only ever sent and received. I'm trying my hardest to figure out how the hell it's happened. Somehow the wallet is compromised, but I'm struggling to figure out how it's happened. The password is strong/generated by a password manager, I've not shared the private key or seed phrases (the wallet is a week old).

Nothing else was accessed, eg bank, email, any other accounts, just the Phantom wallet (which I have on a chrome extension and on my mobile, which I had downloaded last night).

The wallet that it went to has only seen IN transactions then whatever is the latest (explanations please)

https://etherscan.io/address/0xd924cC0A843a023ba07a436d779Ec1480Dc4c359

Anyone able to advise on where I went wrong?

Never been interested in nfts, airdrops (don't have a clue what they are), not been clicking or trying receive any free shit.

I've been trying to go over absolutely everything I did yesterday and the only thing I can think I went wrong was when I was researching the melania meme coin, I don't know if I had synced or logged in with the Phantom Wallet (that had $0 at the time) to a site when I was looking into ways to buy SOL. I had logged into ape.pro via the Phantom Wallet and I believe I had connected my wallet to uniswap. Something that stood out was there was a jupuary.jup.ag link in my history which I do not recall visiting and nothing prior to the website showing to indicate that I had purposely went out my way to visit.

Any ideas? Anyone able to look into the etherscan to find any clues as to who or what the wallet of the person who stole the money is?

Reddit,ethereum,HELP - I Need Private Client Server Communication in Web3,2025-01-21 01:22:01,"I won't go into all the fine details here, but the basic problem is I need a way for a client to pass a message to a server and receive a response without the server learning the IP of the client. The message is small and can fit into a tx payload with ease, but I do not want to spam messages into the chain. The server can know the Ethereum address of the client. The solution does not have to be Web3 native. The solution must run in a browser env ( IE I can not handle raw TCP comms at the low levels ). 

I have considered OHTTP via Cloudflare ( not sure if this will actually work in a browser though )

I have considered passing the messages using Txns in chain but hate this idea since it is slow and wasteful in terms of user resources and server resources.

I have considered XMTP but this system is still early stage and highly centralized - meaning it could go offline at any time.

I have considered IPFS but this is a huge pain to say the least and I would prefer to not use it.

I have considered Whisper ( or Wagmu I think is the new name ) but Whisper had terrible support back in the day and I fear it still might.

I have considered Tor but this can not be done in a browser.

I have considered I2P but this can not be done in a browser.

Honestly, at this point I would be happy with paying for a reverse proxy that strips all of the client IP address info and blackholes the logs but I can not find any well established services like this. I did try routing through Cloudflare but for some reason their system always includes the X-Forwarded-For or some variant header no matter what worker stripping or rule stripping you set up...

Reddit,bitcoin,Read this if you don't want to get banned - Trumpcoin & off-topic political commentary is not allowed here,2025-01-25 21:28:36,"I'm sure that you've noticed that we've been locking politically related threads in here lately and I'm going to explain why. We've been locking these threads because many of the commenters can't manage to stay on-topic when posting in threads that have anything to do with current politics. Many of the comments in these threads used to be insults, arguing about politics, and off-topic political commentary, and not about Bitcoin. But now after Trump's meme coin was recently released, more of the comments in these threads end up being about his shitcoin. It's typical for half of the comments in Trump related threads to either be about his shitcoin or about politics now, and not about bitcoin. This is why we've been locking these threads lately.

This is the Bitcoin subreddit. This is not the Trumpcoin sub. So stop commenting about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin. Everybody in this sub is aware of Trump's shitcoin. You don't need to keep posting about it. If you want to post comments about Trump's shitcoin, then head over to the sub for it and stop spamming about it in r\/Bitcoin. **Anybody that posts about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

This is not a politics subreddit. Stop posting off-topic political commentary in r\/Bitcoin. There are countless political subreddits where you can post about politics unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not one of them. **Anybody that posts political comments that are not about Bitcoin in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

Subsequent rule violators will be banned for longer than 1 week if we notice that you're a repeat offender.

My wallet is protected with a passphrase (25th word), which only they and I know. Even if someone broke into my home and stole my instructions, my BTC would still be safe.

I'll be trying to make an argument here as to why this *cycle* will be different than those past, and why future bear markets, while still prevalent and important, will be unlike those we have experienced previously as well.

# 1. Supply Side Constraints

*- The Evaporating Bitcoin Liquidity Buffer. -*

Every four years, the halving cuts the amount of new Bitcoin entering the system by - *you guessed it* \- half. Of course, the amount of Bitcoin currently available, or being traded, does not immediately cut in half, though. This results in a lagging indicator as the Bitcoin currently being mined is offset by the existing Bitcoin being traded until everything else catches up and the market plays itself out. In general however, these are generally a gross oversimplification of its correlation to the price.

[Chart courtesy of CryptoQuant.com](https://preview.redd.it/0hc1g2yjnzfe1.png?width=2220&format=png&auto=webp&s=da6a131d9b8135a0c3d1ad47a27ac55cf69d6f14)

Historically, in each previous halving, the amount of Bitcoin available on exchanges has been positively correlated with price - which makes sense in theory. Price goes up, people put their Bitcoin on the exchanges to capitalize on the rise. Price goes down, people leave their Bitcoin on the exchange because of convenience, ignorance, or some combination of those factors. The result? A blue line on the chart above that essentially goes up and to the right.

>**I) 2013 Bull Market**  
$10 to $1,000 USD  
\~0 BTC\*\*\*\*\*  to \~1M BTC in exchange reserves.  
^(\*It is difficult to extrapolate exchange reserves this far back, as Bitcoin was still nascent.)

>**II) 2017 Bull Market**  
$500 to $20,000 USD  
\~1.2M BTC to \~2.5M BTC in exchange reserves

>**III) 2021 Bull Market**  
$12,000 USD to $69,000 USD  
\~2.8M BTC to \~3.2M BTC in exchange reserves

This supply of Bitcoin that was *active* and *readily available* helped alleviate the effects of a halving's supply shock. The Bitcoin that was no longer being produced by miners, was in effect just being '*produced*' (for the sake of the market supply), by investors that already held the Bitcoin.

This enabled a stronger supply buffer that **absorbed the increased market demand** that a maturing Bitcoin was creating. Therefore had the buffer not existed, the price would have been affected much more by this existing demand.

**So whats different this time?**

https://preview.redd.it/76q014y791ge1.png?width=2188&format=png&auto=webp&s=934fc5e9944911cec9fded01718ab34ad7e5d417

For the first time in Bitcoin's history, we have seen a true, consistent mass exodus of coins off of exchanges. From Bitcoin ETF's inhaling hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins over the past year, and Institutional and Nation-State adoption, to people finally understanding *NYK,NYC*. Bitcoin exchange reserves are haemorrhaging their Bitcoin quicker than depositors can get their coins onto the exchange to sell them. Over the past year, almost a third of exchange reserves have vanished - into eventual destinations that are looking to hold them long term - not paper handed traders.

[Courtesy of Bitcointreasuries.net](https://preview.redd.it/ys9tm61e91ge1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f864f605d366144ac975e3319592b17510821a2)

Over 100,000 Bitcoin was added to tracked treasuries and funds in **just the past 30 days.** These are not the same types of entities that will paper-hands sell the Bitcoin should the time come.

This is a **massive departure** from market behaviours in past cycles, and the inevitability of that blue exchange reserves line continuing to go farther down is not priced in at all when bigger and bigger players will attempt to compete for a smaller and smaller amount of available coin for sale. The United States wants to acquire 1,000,000 Coins? European, Middle Eastern, and Asian nation states want to follow suit? MSTR wants to continue to purchase 10,000 BTC per week? El Salvador continues their Daily DCA? Retail investors? The nominal amount of Bitcoin they want to purchase does not exist. Cue the squeeze.

# 2. New Capital Multiplier

\- *The Effect on Price and Market Cap -*

Its important to understand the correlation between new capital injections into Bitcoin, and the effect that capital has on the market cap. (*This is true of all assets as well, and is not unique to Bitcoin.*)

Bitcoin is currently sitting pretty at a $2 Trillion USD market capitalization. This is the amount of value currently safeguarded by the Bitcoin network. *Yes*, if everyone were to attempt to sell their Bitcoin at this exact moment, nowhere near $2 Trillion USD would be able to be extracted and deposited in seller's bank accounts, because as the Bitcoin is sold, the price will fall. This is true for **any** asset to greater and lesser extents. Gold has a market capitalization of $17 Trillion USD, and yet if everyone were to sell their gold, that amount of cash would also not be able to be realized. We base these figures on their fair market value because of the marginal price of the last Bitcoin sold.

This effect works in the opposite way as well. How many dollars would need to be spent for Bitcoin to increase from $100,000 USD to $200,000 USD? An Increase like this would send the Market Cap from $2 Trillion USD to $4 Trillion. I've had way too many conversations with people that have the misconception that for the Market cap to Increase by $2 Trillion, an equal amount of capital needs to be injected into the system.

In reality, because each Bitcoin that exists is worth the marginal exchange rate of the last traded coin, there is a multiplication factor that is applied to the market cap. A $20 Billion Purchase could singlehandedly create a 10%+ swing in the price of Bitcoin. That's a $20 Billion Purchase that would have a $200 Billion increase in the effective Market Cap of the Asset.

This is why directly comparing BTC's market capitalization to gold or other assets can be difficult, as there are trillions of dollars of potential inflows, which multiplied, correspond to a market capitalization that far exceeds the amount of money that went in. This of course does not create money out of thin air, because as mentioned, if everyone were to attempt to realize these gains, the price would subsequently fall.

**How is the multiplier different this cycle?**

This argument falls more in line with my initial point of the quickly shrinking available supply. As the Bitcoin available dries up, this multiplier is exacerbated. Each dollar is fighting over less and less Bitcoin. Investors and Analysts currently compare this asset directly with the available financial instruments and tools already available to them. Corporations, which have price ceilings in line with their EPS, growth potential, and market saturation. And Commodities, which have price ceilings due to matured price discovery, and utility limits.

Bitcoin's potential is not priced in from this perspective IMO, there is no precedent to compare it against, we are still in the wild-west. The $17 Trillion Market Cap of gold is not the end game, it is just another milestone.

# 3. Market Dampening Factors

*- Lower Volatility and Higher Stability. -*

Bitcoin's volatility is always a major talking-point that goes hand-in-hand with the discussion surrounding its price. As Bitcoin matures however, the price volatility of the asset will continue to stabilize. Let's look at a few of the factors that may play a major role in this.

**I) Halvings and Stock-to-Flow**

The most obvious factor that lessens the volatility of Bitcoin, is the diminishing effect that each sequential halving has on affecting the supply rate of Bitcoin. In 2012, when the block reward decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, That was a major supply shock as now only 25% of the total BTC supply would be mined in the following four years (the 10,500,001st BTC, to the 15,750,000th BTC). Compare this to the halving that just occurred in 2024. The following four years will only see 3.125% of the Bitcoin total supply being mined. (from the 19,687,500th BTC, to the 20,343,750th BTC). A vast majority of all of the Bitcoin that will ever exist, already exists.

Therefore, as each halving happens, it will have a smaller and smaller effect on the availability of current active Bitcoin to actually affect the market.

**II) The Waves vs. The Size of the Ship**

As Bitcoin continues to grow, the less and less of an effect a comparable event has on the price. The first country to announce adoption of Bitcoin had a much larger effect on the price than the eventual last country will. A multinational organization announcing adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet when Bitcoin was $30,000, would have a much higher price effect than had that same company announced the addition of Bitcoin if it were trading at $300,000. This also works in reverse. If Bitcoin eventually reaches $500,000 per coin, and El Salvador were to announce they are outlawing Bitcoin, the negative price effect would be less than if they were to make that same announcement today.

Overall, the larger Bitcoin gets, the smaller of an effect any single event will have, lowering the volatility of the asset.

**III) Increased Regulatory Clarity**

Uncertainty creates volatility, because literally anything can happen, and less is priced in. If Binance can get banned from operating in your country at any moment (see: Canada), or if blatant frauds are allowed to operate unchecked (see: FTX), large investors can feel uneasy about jumping in because they view industry as nascent and shady.

Regulatory Clarity, which we are seeing rapidly develop in the US and abroad, fixes this and removes a lot of uncertainty from the market. Regulations are not inherently bad as some people and free market purists may want to believe. Its not a secret that there is fraud and scammers in the 'crypto' space. As someone that used to work in the space and see it first hand, attempts to rectify this and fix market sentiment regarding it are welcome.

**IV) Institutional Adoption + Portfolio Rebalancing**

One of the more nuanced factors that will actively affect future volatility is the fledgling institutional adoption that is happening today. Many funds are quickly adopting MSTR, IBIT, and other Bitcoin proxies on their balance sheets in order to have exposure to these assets. These entities, however, can also be at the guided by industry regulations and their stakeholders.

Many portfolios have rules as to how they are allocated. Some may only want 10% exposure to certain technology stocks, or a certain percentage allocated to bonds. This is why you often hear of hedge funds and investors recommending a few percentage of your portfolio be allocated to Bitcoin. While diversification may be a novel concept for many of us on this subreddit, some investors live by it.

How does this affect Bitcoin? Let us imagine a scenario in which a large pension fund allocates 2% of their fund to a Bitcoin ETF. If Bitcoin doubles in price relative to the rest of their portfolio, that 2% can balloon to 4%. On a regular basis, this fund may be required to rebalance their portfolio to better align to those initial benchmarks they set. Now they must sell half their BTC in order to bring that allocation back down to 2%.

Multiply this by tens of thousands of investors and funds, and you have a serious market force that creates some downward pressure when price skyrockets, as well as upward pressure when price falls, helping to lower volatility in the larger picture.

**What do these four factors and the resulting lower volatility mean?**

Just as mentioned with the regulatory clarity, the increased stability of the price of Bitcoin will help those that are on the fence feel that it is time to get involved. The average investor that is in their retirement is not the target demographic for a short-term volatile asset. The average institution that might have to justify a huge price swing in an asset investment might not want the volatility that Bitcoin currently has. The mom and pop shop down the road might not want to price items in their store in Bitcoin because they will need to re-price it the next day. A once 500% bull market may be a 50% gain, a once 80% bear market may be a 8% drop.

Price stability will usher in a whole new age of Bitcoin adoption that has yet to be seen, from a whole new set of users that currently wouldn't give the asset class a second glance.

# 4. Global Geopolitical Landscape

*- Necessity is the Mother of All Adoption. -*

A majority of us reading this are incredibly privileged to be reading this from *relatively* economically stable and developed nations. The average citizen of Venezuela, Lebanon, or Zimbabwe, will have a drastically different view of the benefits of Bitcoin to themselves and their community than someone from the US, Canada, or the UK.

We've seen a huge shift in sentiment towards Bitcoin from Latin America specifically over the past few years. I was in El Zonte, El Salvador this past year, and seeing the Bitcoin lightning network in action was eye-opening. Guerrilla, grass-roots level adoption. Paying a few hundred satoshis for a snack from a roadside vendor, or filling up your gas tank via a lightning invoice, or how McDonalds integrated Bitcoin payments directly in their point-of-sale kiosks in the Country's capital. Having actual conversations with the owners of bed & breakfasts, taxi drivers, and small restaurant owners changes your perspective about how Bitcoin is viewed in different pockets throughout the globe. How Bitcoin was talked about in a recent CNBC interview, or what investor is looking to purchase a stockpile of Bitcoin isn't an issue that they give a moment's thought. **The upside potential of Bitcoin isn't as important to them as the inevitable downside of the lack of Bitcoin might be**.

As a developed nation, we don't have the same level of urgency of that inevitable downside. We don't have that same level of necessity that drives us en masse towards a solution like Bitcoin. Instead, our underlying mechanism of a problem, while existent, is much slower. And as a result, many people are slow to react, like frogs in a pot of boiling water.

**What happens when we extrapolate this trend?**

We can see down the road as more developing nations continue to adopt Bitcoin out of necessity. They may not adopt it at the nation-state level at first, but their citizens most likely will. The years ahead will allow many other countries to use El Salvador as a blueprint for adoption - a small domino in the greater chain reaction.

Beyond smaller sovereign nation adoption, it's not a secret that the cracks of global economic instability are growing. From escalating American trade wars, to the birth of BRICS and a looming recession - uncertainty is at an all-time-high.

EMEA nations have wealth that they wish to put somewhere. There are more nations than I can count that have sovereign funds in excess of multiple trillion USD. Are they really going to jump at the opportunity to buy more US Bonds, when it is becoming increasingly clear that the US has zero intention of ever paying its debt down? Or will they hedge these opportunities with the largest digital asset in existence to secure their nations future?

**The largest game theory experiment is about to play out before our eyes, as nation states either attempt to front-run the others, or FOMO in out of fear of not having enough.**

Reddit,bitcoin,Money Has Enslaved Mankind,2025-01-31 00:47:36,"In its infancy, Bitcoin represented a radical departure from traditional fiat currency, offering a decentralized alternative to government-controlled money. Like gold before it, Bitcoin's scarcity has driven its value ever higher, creating a sense of urgency and excitement among early adopters. However, as its price stabilizes and adoption reaches critical mass, it will cease to be the revolutionary asset it once was. Just as gold eventually became a stable reserve rather than a speculative investment, Bitcoin will one day be seen as a normal financial instrument rather than a symbol of financial rebellion or societal transformation.

The fundamental issue with Bitcoin—and with capitalism itself—is that it operates within the same supply-and-demand framework that has always governed wealth distribution. While it has provided an escape hatch from inflationary fiat currencies, it does not solve the broader systemic problem of wealth accumulation leading to stagnation. As Bitcoin’s value rises, the transformative returns experienced by early investors will diminish, and the disparity between those who got in early and those who did not will mirror the very inequality it was meant to challenge. The inevitable consolidation of Bitcoin in the hands of the wealthy will repeat the same cycles we have seen throughout history: centralization, diminishing opportunity, and economic stratification.

If Bitcoin is truly a stepping stone, then the next step should not be another asset class that merely recreates capitalism in digital form. Rather, it should push us toward a future where economic exchange itself is reconsidered. While capitalism has been the most effective system for liberating people from feudalism and other oppressive economic structures, its inherent flaws—most notably the concentration of wealth—are becoming increasingly apparent. If we are to create a future that truly transcends these limitations, we must look beyond money, beyond capital itself, and toward a society where value is not dictated by ownership but by contribution, collaboration, and shared prosperity. Bitcoin may be the key to unlocking that conversation, but it is not the final answer.

Now, in the process of all this and with some help from some very experienced people, it turns out there is a way to cause damage to Changelly from their holding transactions under KYC/AML, I'm actually in the banking/compliance industry and one of the things is that they are not allowed to be 'tipping off' under FATF rules, it's the first no no of KYC/AML.

And here is the next part, that damage to Changelly can be used against their partners like Ledger, Exodus who use Changelly as their swap partner holding funds illicitly which are not theirs, it's a simple trick that was used to get them to agree a refund, now it's a case of actually getting the refund, time to work together to make this happen, all I wanted was a simple refund having completed all the requirements including proof of fund ownership.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,bitcoin,0.1 bitcoin - 10 months update,2025-01-30 16:56:08,"An update to my [0.1 bitcoin post march last year.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1biayw8/01_bitcoin/)

0.1 btc was 9k cad then. 

9 months later we broke 135k cad (~100k usd) 

today 0.1 btc hovers 15k cad. Still a deal of a lifetime imo.

Anyone that hodled during this time would have experienced a 60% gain.

Congrats to the diamond hands!

We're gonna see fireworks for the next 10 with the new administration.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Ethereum (ETH) $3000 - The NeverEnding Story,2025-01-30 21:08:07,,2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"I tried to buy $50, I received $47,000 worth of coins.",2025-01-30 20:12:10,"This morning I put in an order to buy $50 of XEN on the Polygon network. I received over 250 billion coins worth over $47,000. I panicked for second, thinking I accidentally bought more than I wanted and check the blockchain transaction. No, I really spent like $40 something dollars and my coinbase wallet was showing me $47,000 of coins. 

Problem is I’ve tried transferring to a stable coin to cash out, I’ve tried swapping it for another coin, bridging it to another network. Every time I try to move it, the value reverts back to what it would’ve been if I had bought $50. I’ve even tried to send $500 of these coins to a friend and it shows up in their wallet as a fraction ($0.11) of the coins my wallet is showing me I sent. 

I had an extra $14 worth of Polygon hanging out in my wallet so I bought more XEN. It added another $12,000 to my wallet. 

How can I capitalize on this and keep the value of bag?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Nayib Bukele crypto dreams are gone: Salvadoran congress passed a law removing all cryptocurrencies as legal tender,2025-01-30 03:35:23,"After 1.6 Billion dollars spent on the Bitcoin Law, El Salvador's congress passed a new law to remove Bitcoin as legal tender, shattering Bukele's crypto dreams. 

Bitcoin is no longer accepted to pay taxes, and business are no longer obligated to offer/accept Bitcoin payment. This was part of the IMF deal that Bukele had to do in order to get a needed rescue loan. The faith of the Chivo Wallet, a custodial wallet created by the salvadoran government, is still unclear. The following weeks are crucial to find out if the Chivo Wallet will be acquired by a private company or just shut down completely. 

Almost FOUR YEARS ago I predicted that the Bitcoin Law was going to fail misserably, because El Salvador doesn't have the infrastructure to deal with regular credit card payments, and adding cryptocurrency payments was never gonna take off. Besides that, salvadorans lack tech knowledge to actually use crypto for their every day activities.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Chainlink (LINK) Just Launched the DeFi Yield Index (CDY Index) - A Game Changer for Onchain Lending,2025-01-30 14:52:10,"Just came across with this Chainlink [Tweet ](https://x.com/chainlink/status/1884951234840240385)that announces a new data product they have launched, Chainlink DeFi Yield Index (CDY Index) which aggregates market wide DeFi lending rates using Chainlink standard.

This is a very important development for institutional adoption of DeFi tracking. As you know, data reliablitiy is very important and one of the biggest barriers for traditional finance (TradFi) users entering DeFi is the lack of reliable aggregated data on lending yields. CDY index goal is to solve this problem standardizing and simplifying access to real time on chain lending rates data. Now you dont have to manually track different protocols and compare them falling into a mess of different data. Now they can easily have a clear picture of DeFi lending opportunities at once.

https://preview.redd.it/oa56c8aw95ge1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abe4d384bc13743ee4bd6ded99292da6c045b232

To achieve this product they have used Space and Time (SxT) technology for the calculation process. This tech ensures that the index is robust, tamper proof, etc. making this data valuable for institutions. This whole process is also decentralized and makes the data also transparent, accurate and resistant to manipulation.

This tool is not only useful for institutions, it is also for individuals that want to compare yields across protocols instead of having to join multiple platforms to find the best rates.

Another step forward to reduce the gap between DeFi and TradFi and making things a lot more easier.

**What is lending yield?**

Lending yield is the money a lender earns from making loans and it is usually a %. It comes from interest and fees paid by borrowers.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Question - Are memecoins not just collectibles?,2025-01-30 11:41:32,"I feel like I should know more about crypto, but I'm mid-50s and perhaps this is the time I start to feel old, lol. :)

With all the talk about the Trump memecoin, aren't these memecoins basically the same thing as other collectibles from the past?  Basically like the same thing as if Marvel Comics  releases a limited run of 500 versions of a comic book with a special variant cover?  Or chase cards in various forms of collectible cards (baseball, pokemon, etc.)?

Except a memecoin has a built in exchange and a way to sell it.  Like if I took a ""valuable"" comic book and tried to purchase goods or services with it, it would be hard because the other person doesn't know what it is worth.  And they worry there is information asymmetry that might cause them to overvalue the comic book.  Plus, they don't actually want to OWN the comic book and then have to sell it on eBay......which is a pain in the butt and (again) they are not a comic book merchant and might not price it correctly.

Isn't a Trump coin the same basic thing......except it is easy to check the value and easier to convert back into a currency you prefer (like bitcoin or US dollars)?  And with blockchain preventing counterfeiting (which can be a problem with other collectibles)?

Edit - Thanks a lot folks.  You basically confirmed what I suspected.  And - to be clear - I have no interest in buying memecoins.  I did buy comic books in my youth and do remember how valuable some of the old issues got......but that was true rarity.  It was from an era when comics were sold to children and mostly ended up rumpled up in a backpack.  Then the comic companies realized that ""collectors"" would buy more if they restarted Spider Man with a ALL NEW #1 issue and a bunch of limited edition variants of the #1 issues.....except now it wasn't children buying them.....it was adult men buying them and immediately sending them away to be ""graded"" and encased in lucite.  And then they would release ANOTHER ALL NEW #1 about 18 months later and the cycle would repeat and repeat......and you can guess how much those ""collectible"" comics are worth now.  You find them at comic shops in what's called the ""dollar box"" which is a box were any comic is a $1: It's junk.  I'm sure baseball cards are similar.  Heck, US postage stamps are similar: Postal service mostly prints stamps for collectors now.  I mean....stamps COULD be used on actual mail, but almost none are: Collectors buy them, bring them immediately home and put them in the collection......and they're only worth anything to another collector (who probably also bought them from the post office when they were new, lol).  Sounds like memecoins could be fun for some people, but they could also just gamble.  ",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Self-Healing Blockchain,2025-01-30 21:14:11,"Imagine a blockchain system that’s designed to last well into the future, secure from both today’s threats and tomorrow’s technological advancements. The core idea here is to create a blockchain that is quantum-resistant and self-healing, while also making it smarter and more efficient through the use of artificial intelligence (AI).

Quantum-Resistant Blockchain:
As quantum computing progresses, it poses a significant threat to traditional blockchain encryption methods. This new system would use quantum-resistant cryptography, which ensures that the blockchain remains secure even in a world where quantum computers are able to break traditional cryptographic systems.

AI-Driven Trust and Consensus:
Instead of relying on energy-intensive methods like Proof of Work or centralization-driven Proof of Stake, the blockchain would use an AI-driven consensus mechanism. This means the system would trust nodes based on their reputation and behavior, constantly monitored and evaluated by AI. This would make the network both more secure and more efficient by prioritizing trust over raw computing power or financial stake.

Self-Healing Smart Contracts:
Smart contracts are a powerful feature of blockchains, but they often contain flaws that hackers can exploit. In this system, self-healing smart contracts would automatically detect vulnerabilities and fix themselves without any human intervention. This means fewer hacks and more reliability in the system overall.

The Goal:
The end goal is to create a blockchain that can grow and adapt to new technologies without compromising security, trust, or scalability. It would be a blockchain that’s ready for the future—both in terms of quantum computing and evolving AI—making it a lasting solution for decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and other blockchain applications.

In short, this would be a smarter, more secure blockchain designed to withstand technological advances and keep improving itself over time.

that is their most recent statement which shows they are bleeding millions a year. That is about the amount of the top 2 execs salary with Arie making 500k and two board members very close. The other guy is Arie's family also. They own 95% of the stock also and over the last 12 months have bought none.

It also shows that they are not profitable and their only revenue is from the app they sell users to ""mine"" more xyo. If you just bought the xyo with the fees you would get more. They dont sell data like they claim and that report proves it.

Their new chain will pay out stake. Name one chain that pays stake and does not infalte? New users and people chasing this news need to understand that the next news they drop with the chain operational will be that XYO is removing the max cap and or printing a fresh supply to pay for the stake. This will be damaging to the price of XYO no doubt.

A lot of people that buy coins like this do not do something as simple as search recent SEC statements.

Even worse they made a post on twitter that claims their stock is in very high demand [https://x.com/OfficialXYO/status/1882443587373215996](https://x.com/OfficialXYO/status/1882443587373215996)

but if you take a quick look its only trading 100 bucks worth a day.

This is a quote from that statement.

""For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net loss of $610,291. The Company was not able to cover its operational costs with the product and services sales generated and will likely need to further invest in marketing for user acquisition to increase COIN App income and advertising revenue to reach break-even for its products and services. As a result, the Company may incur further operating losses and seek to fund its operations through equity and/or debt financing or other sources, as it deems necessary. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, including due to general macroeconomic conditions or unforeseen factors. If the Company fails to raise capital or generate liquidity through the sale of its products and services, it will have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies. Those conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern from the filing date of this Semi-Annual Report on Form 1-SA. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.""

The company owns 800 mil XYO and 0 btc as per that statement but they owe 500 mil of those out to warrants. Here is another quote from that paper.

""In 2019, the Company issued XYO Token warrants to consultants. The warrants enable the holders thereof to purchase XYO Tokens at a fixed price for up to 10 years. These warrants were deemed to be a form of additional compensation and an obligation, rather than equity, however, as the warrants are tied to an internally developed intangible asset, the XYO Token. Therefore, no value has been ascribed to them. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company recognized no provisional liability from the XYO Warrants granted. The Company had 13 and 13 outstanding warrants for a total of 258,387,376 and 312,387,376 XYO tokens as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company paid out 36,905,433 XYO tokens under the XYO warrant plan during the six months ended June 30, 2024.""

TLDR 0 FUD all facts, this company is a sinking ship and anyone buying or thinking about it needs to look at these reports that clearly show a company on the verge of bankruptcy.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Opinion: We should not be using any cryptocurrency as a national reserve unless it's secure against nation-level attacks for both Sybil attacks and Censorship attacks,2025-01-30 02:41:49,"**I am fundamentally against using any cryptocurrency as a nation's reserve currency unless it has very strong security against nation-level attacks.**

Once a cryptocurrency is elevated as a national reserve currency, it will be targeted by enemies nations if its security protocol has a weakness.

--------------

####**What makes a blockchain immune to nation-level attacks?**

There are many factors:

1. It needs to have **economic security**, meaning that there is an extremely high economic cost of attacking the network relative to the value protected by the network. Most PoS blockchains have high economic security, and ones with slashing are practically immune to economic attacks.
1. It needs to have a sustainable and permanent security budget (e.g. tail emissions)
1. It needs to have a high ratio of security budget to network value
1. Its **development** needs to a decentralized and not controlled by entities within a single nation
1. Its **governance** needs to a decentralized and not controlled by entities within a single nation
1. (Optional) Most users are running their own node clients instead of connecting through RPCs. Unfortunately, there isn't a single blockchain that satisfies this today.

Aside from the last point, most decentralized PoS networks that have global development and community governance are immune to nation-level attacks.

--------------

####**Is Ethereum immune to nation-level attacks?**

Ethereum, with its 10+ independent node developer teams and global community governing through rough consensus, satisfies all but the last optional criteria. It is immune to nation-level attacks. It has extremely strong economic security through PoS with slashing. Any nation could take over all the validators and developers within its own borders, and the blockchain's global security would still be intact.

Ethereum is sufficiently-strong against nation-scale attacks, but it's not perfect. Like all blockchains, it is possible to temporarily DDoS the blockchain by attacking global RPCs, but that would only be a temporary attack. AFAIK, there are currently no blockchains with thin clients, so EVERY blockchain is weak to RPC attacks. EthDevs are already developing thin clients that can run on smartphone-sized devices, but that's still years away on the roadmap.

--------------

####**Is Ripple Ledger immune to nation-level attacks?**

Ripple's security protocol is based on a trusted network of validators (i.e. whitelisted validators, the main network picks 30 of them). Each node can selectively pick which validators it trusts. It is actually easy to censor parts of the network since every node is silo'ed around the validators it trusts.

If there is censorship by the US government, US nodes would split from the rest of the world that don't want that censorship, and there would be a fork. So while the US government could never sensor global nodes, it could easily split its own nodes from the rest of the network, and that's a valid operation allowed by Ripple Ledger protocol.

--------------

####**Is Bitcoin immune to nation-level attacks?**

**Could the a nation-level 51% attacker censor the network?**

Yes. It would have full control of which blocks are included in the canonical chain

**Could the a nation-level 51% attacker reorg the network?**

Yes. It would have full control of deciding which fork is in the canonical chain

PoW blockchains are fundamentally weak to 51% attacks. This is why so many blockchains using PoW have been successfully attacked and reorged while none using more secure consensus protocols like PoS have been compromised.

**Currently, Bitcoin's security ratio through PoW is only a measly 1%, and it gets worse over time**

Bitcoin is currently a $2T currency protected by only $20B of mining equipment. The cost of attacking is very cheap. China by itself has enough chip fabrication plants to outproduce the rest of the world over a period of 5-10 years. As Bitcoin becomes more popular and its security budgets gets worse and worse due to halvings, the security ratio is only going to get worse. It will only get cheaper to attack as BTC's value goes up and its declining security budget gets worse.

On the positive side, Bitcoin has a massive market cap. It can eventually fix this by switching from PoW to PoS like Ethereum to become immune to nation-level attacks",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

https://preview.redd.it/qtz0tezvowfe1.jpg?width=2800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10c8d510253b32f215591046c1e613693c07c478

Big news for the tokenized assets race. BlackRock using Securitize has officially launched Wormhole integration allowing tokenized funds to work with different assets on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.

This is another step forward on the institutional level tokenization ensuring improved liquidity, cross chain interoperability and investor will be able to access it in a easy and seamless way.

Like CEO of Securitize, Carlos Domingo, said:

>

This is quite a big win for Wormhole project against other competitors but I believe that BlackRock and other institutions will try to have multiple ways to tokenize assets choosing multiple projects that handle this in different way. I expect this because I work as a Software developer for a bank and most of the times we try to have multiple alternatives ready so if something goes wrong we have multiple options.

This is also huge because BlackRock is a big boy and now they have access to all the tokenization system cross chain, etc. Enables $1b+ tokenized funds making them mobile reducing fragmentation across different networks and enables. Investors can now interact with them across multiple blockchains, etc.

This is really good for crypto in general and for Ethereum ecosystem because as you could see, most of the projects available now are on this chain. Meaning that Ethereum bright future keeps consolidating. I hope this also helps to remove some noise regarding Ethereum.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,MicroStrategy Bond Tokenization Sends WhiteRock Up – Discussing the Impact,2025-01-29 21:36:19,"Hola r/cryptocurrency,

So, I was doing some digging today and came across something a lil crazy. [WhiteRock.Fi](http://WhiteRock.Fi) announced they’re tokenizing MicroStrategy’s bonds, and their $WHITE token has gone up by 35%+ today, and still is going up as I am writing this. TradFi and DeFi seem to be getting more intertwined by the day. But before we get too excited, let's dive into what I think the implications are.

MicroStrategy has been a big player in the Bitcoin space for years, holding over 140k BTC. They’ve issued bonds to fund more Bitcoin buys. Now, WhiteRock is stepping in to tokenize these bonds. Essentially, they’re turning these traditional financial instruments into digital tokens that can be traded on-chain. It’s like taking Wall Street and cryptofying it.

One of the key benefits here us retail degens aren't being scammed by institutional whales. Traditional markets often have off-market trading hours where institutional players can manipulate prices without much oversight. With tokenized assets, everything is recorded on a public ledger. This could reduce shady deals and give retail investors a fairer shot at the market. So every trade in real-time—no shot for backroom deals.

Another potential advantage is liquidity. Traditional bonds and stocks aren’t exactly easy to trade quickly. Tokenizing them could make them more accessible and easier to trade, opening doors for smaller investors.

The market’s clearly hyped—$WHITE token jumped nearly 40% today supposedly because of MicroStrategy tokenisation. But let’s not get carried away. Crypto loves to overreact. Perhaps the tokenisation boom is yet another AI Boom. Or it could be the start of something legit. Only time will tell.

Of course, there are challenges. Tokenizing real-world assets is a legal minefield. Regulators are still figuring out how to handle crypto and spell blockchain, and bonds and stocks add another layer of complexity. Will the SEC be okay with this? Doubtful. Smart contracts are powerful but not perfect. Bugs, hacks, and exploits are always a risk. If something goes wrong, it could blow up in everyone’s faces. And just because something’s tokenized doesn’t mean people will use it. Traditional investors might be hesitant to jump into this new system. If the big players don’t buy in, this whole thing could fizzle out.

However, I do think that This development shows that blockchain isn’t just about memecoins and NFTs. It has practical applications that could change finance, and not just be its brother with a birth defect. If platforms like WhiteRock succeed, it could pave the way for more real-world asset projects. this is still experimental. It’s exciting, but risky. Goes without saying, don’t FOMO into anything without doing your own research.

So, what do you think? Is tokenizing bonds and stocks a step towards democratizing finance, or is it just another trend that’ll fade away? Could this really protect retail investors from off-market scams, or are we just seeing another one day fly? Lemme hear you opinions!

TL;DR: [WhiteRock.Fi](http://WhiteRock.Fi) tokenized MicroStrategy’s bond and their token surged nearly 40% today. Bold move to bring real-world assets on-chain, potentially providing transparency against off-market scams, but there are risks. Thoughts?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966
Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Probability of randomly generating an EC public key,2025-01-29 15:06:22,"From what I understand the size of a secp256k1 EC public key is 65 bytes (out of which one is a prefix byte so lets ignore that). The private key is any 256-bit number in [0, N] where N is the order of the curve. So if I have a random 64-byte stream, the probability of it being a valid EC public key on the curve is `N / 2^512 = 2^256 / 2^512 = 2^{-256}`. Does this sound right?

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"". So then how would I find the probabilty of a random 32-byte stream being a valid EC public key on the (secp256k1) curve? Does the probability remain the same?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

So I'm guessing (pk0, pk1) is probably from Ed25519 but (ak0, ak1) may be from X25519. The patient data is then encrypted using ak0, but isn't that something you aren't supposed to do? The paper doesn't mention the size constraints on patient data either.

It then says that:

>The newly generated data has to be validated before they can be added to the blockchain. These data are validated by the admin (doctor, pathologists, radiologists) following the process depicted in figure 5 using the admin private key ak1.

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };
    
    struct xws initializer(__uint128_t x_init, __uint128_t weyl_init, const __uint128_t s_init)
    {
        __uint128_t x = 0;
        __uint128_t weyl = 0;
        __uint128_t s = 0;
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++)
        {
            x_init = (-(x_init & 1) & (x_init + ((x_init + 1) >> 1)) | ~- (x_init & 1) & (x_init >> 1)) ^ (weyl_init += s_init);
            x += (x_init & 1) << i;
        }

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-01-31 00:51:40.581966

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)
