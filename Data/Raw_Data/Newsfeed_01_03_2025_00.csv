Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For,2025-01-02 23:30:18+00:00,"Technical analysis shows that Shiba Inu is currently at a critical juncture where it could either rebound to new multi-year highs or face declines to retest a few support levels. In light of this, a recent analysis on TradingView has highlighted crucial support and resistance levels that could dictate SHIB’s short-term movements. This analysis was made on the daily candlestick timeframe chart of SHIB against Tether (USDT), which reveals the potential for a substantial rally toward $0.000045 if key resistance levels are broken. Major Support And Resistance Levels For Shiba Inu According to the analysis, two significant resistance levels are important in SHIB’s path to the upside. The first is at $0.00003239 and represents an immediate hurdle that could attract sellers or trigger profit-taking. This is more revealing, considering it acted as resistance in December 2024. A decisive move above this level would signal bullish momentum.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Flag Pattern Says Crash Is Far From Over Despite Crash To $91,000 The second resistance level is at $0.00004563 and is considered a psychologically significant barrier that might test the strength of market optimism. This is because this price level serves as the peak of Shiba Inu’s price movement in early 2024. If the bulls were to complete a successful move above $0.00004563, it could signal a move that would push Shiba Inu to challenge its current all-time high. On the downside, there are also two critical support levels that could prevent further SHIB price declines. The first notable support is at $0.00001035. Shiba Inu rebounded quite a few times on the upper end of this support zone in 2024, with the most notable bounce taking place on August 5. Historically, this level has demonstrated strong buy interest, making it a potential floor for the current trend. However, if the price fails to hold above this critical support level, the situation could shift significantly. A break below $0.00001035 would likely diminish buyer confidence, paving the way for SHIB to test even lower levels of support. Technical Indicators And SHIB Trading Strategy The analysis notes that key indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, currently suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment for Shiba Inu. The MACD is flat with minimal momentum, while the RSI hovers near 40, slightly below the midpoint. These indicators, coupled with subdued trading volume, suggest that traders are awaiting a decisive breakout or break below the Shiba Inu price.

Conversely, a break below $0.00001035 could reinforce a bearish scenario. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002239 and is up by 8% in the past 24 hours. According to a similar support level analysis by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the $0.0000215 to $0.0000193 support zone must hold in order for Shiba Inu to stay bullish.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Sinks To Lowest Since FTX Crash: Bottom In?,2025-01-02 22:00:30+00:00,"Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has witnessed a plunge to two-year lows recently. Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Plummeted Over The Past Month As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index has seen a sharp drawdown into negative territory recently. The “Coinbase Premium Index” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This metric’s value can tell us about the difference in the buying and selling behaviors of the investors present in the two cryptocurrency exchange giants. More specifically, the indicator represents how the moves of the American institutional entities (the dominant force on Coinbase) differ from those of the global whales. When the Coinbase Premium Index has a positive value, it means the asset is trading at a higher rate on Coinbase than on Binance. Such a trend implies that US-based whales participate in a higher amount of buying (or a lower amount of selling) than global investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch? On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark suggests that Binance users are the ones taking part in the higher amount of buying, as the coin is going for a higher price there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index was at a positive level during the cryptocurrency’s exploration of new highs in the last two months of 2024. The pattern observed throughout the year was that the American institutional investors occupied the driving seat in the market, with shifts in buying and selling pressure from them reflecting in the asset’s price. Around mid-December, the indicator started to dip into the negative territory and has since maintained the trajectory. BTC’s spot value has also shown a downward trajectory alongside this trend, so it seems that Coinbase users continue to play a prime role in the sector. Following the latest continuation of the drop, the Coinbase Premium Index has dipped lower than the low from October. In fact, the indicator has now been at its lowest value since November 2022, more than two years ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Now Worst Since Mid-October: Reversal Signal? Considering that the Coinbase whales have been important for Bitcoin’s direction in the past year, the indicator being locked in a downtrend could spell further doom for the cryptocurrency’s price. That said, the asset has historically tended to bottom out when selling pressure has become too strong on Coinbase, as eventually new buyers start showing up to take coins at a cheaper rate off the hands of the sellers. The sharp negative spike alongside the FTX crash also resulted in a major bottom for BTC. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the FUD from the US-based investors has reached a high enough level for a bottom or not. BTC Price Bitcoin has kicked the new year off on a positive note as the asset’s price has seen a recovery rally to the $96,600 level.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Former Terra CEO Do Kwon Enters Not Guilty Plea In Landmark $40 Billion Crypto Trial,2025-01-02 20:33:17+00:00,"Do Kwon, the South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur and co-founder of Terraform Labs, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a series of criminal fraud charges in a Manhattan federal court.  This comes just days after his extradition from Montenegro, where he had been detained for over a year. His case centers around the collapse of TerraUSD and Luna (LUNC), which collectively lost an estimated $40 billion in 2022. Ordered To Remain In Custody Following Court Appearance According to a Reuters report, federal prosecutors unsealed a nine-count indictment accusing Kwon of multiple offenses, including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Related Reading: If Solana Reclaims $210 ‘New Highs Are Next’ – Price Analysis Dressed in an olive green long-sleeved shirt and black sweatpants, Kwon appeared in court alongside his lawyer, Andrew Chesley, who indicated that they would not seek bail at this time.  Following Kwon’s plea, US Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger reportedly ordered him to remain in custody. Do Kwon left the courtroom with a copy of the 79-page indictment, and he is scheduled to return for another hearing on January 8. The Fallout From Do Kwon Alleged Fraud And Market Manipulation In June, Kwon reached a civil settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), agreeing to pay an $80 million fine and accept a ban from participating in cryptocurrency transactions. This settlement was part of a broader $4.55 billion resolution related to alleged misconduct in the management of Terraform Labs. The indictment details how Kwon allegedly misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD, a stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1. In May 2021, when the stablecoin’s value began to falter, Kwon reportedly claimed that a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had successfully restored its peg.  In reality, prosecutors allege that Do Kwon orchestrated a scheme involving a high-frequency trading firm to secretly purchase millions of dollars of TerraUSD to artificially inflate its price. Related Reading: Weekly Chart Shows That Dogecoin Price Is Primed To Cross $11 In 2025, Here’s How This reportedly drove both retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products, significantly boosting the value of Luna, another token linked to TerraUSD, to as high as $50 billion by the spring of 2022. The indictment states, “Much of this growth followed Kwon’s brazen deceptions about Terraform and its technology.” However, the situation took a turn for the worse in May 2022 when TerraUSD’s value began to decline again. The trading firm that had previously propped it up warned Kwon that maintaining its value “wasn’t so simple this time.”  The subsequent crash of both TerraUSD and Luna sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, leading to substantial losses for investors and contributing to a broader downturn that affected other digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). While prosecutors have not disclosed the identity of the trading firm involved, SEC lawyers previously indicated that Jump Trading had played a role in supporting TerraUSD during its peak in May 2021.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Chainlink Tunrns Resistance Into Support – ATH Next?,2025-01-02 20:30:41+00:00,"The crypto market showed signs of revival yesterday, with several assets experiencing significant price surges after weeks of subdued action. Chainlink (LINK) stood out, gaining over 15% in just 24 hours, solidifying its position as one of the stronger altcoins in the current environment. This sharp recovery highlights growing interest in LINK as market sentiment shifts. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead? Renowned analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing a critical development in Chainlink’s price action. According to Jelle, LINK has successfully flipped a key resistance level into support—a bullish signal that often precedes substantial upward momentum. This structural shift could pave the way for Chainlink to target higher price levels as it prepares to test crucial supply zones. The market’s renewed energy and Chainlink’s ability to hold key levels suggest that the coming days could be pivotal. If the bullish momentum persists, LINK could soon challenge overhead resistance, setting the stage for a larger breakout. Amid this awakening market, Chainlink’s recent surge underscores its potential as a standout performer in the altcoin space. Chainlink Investors Waking Up Chainlink has faced notable selling pressure since peaking at $30 on December 13, triggering a pullback that tested the resilience of its bullish structure. However, recent price action suggests a shift in momentum as bulls show signs of waking up. This could mark the beginning of a massive rally, according to analysts closely monitoring the market. Top analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a crucial development in LINK’s short-term trend. According to Jelle, Chainlink appears to have flipped a key resistance level into support—a structural shift often seen as a precursor to significant upward movement. This bullish signal has reignited optimism among investors, with Jelle suggesting that LINK could target all-time highs in the near future if current momentum continues. The key now lies in LINK’s ability to break through critical supply zones in the coming days. A successful breach of these levels could pave the way for an aggressive rally as buyers look to capitalize on renewed market strength. As the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, Chainlink’s ability to reverse its recent downtrend positions it as a potential leader in the altcoin space. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Testing Crucial Liquidity Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $22.55, reflecting a strong bounce from local demand levels. The price is now testing a critical supply zone, which could determine its next major move. Encouragingly, LINK is trading above the 4-hour 200 EMA at $22.27, a key technical indicator that often signals bullish momentum when sustained as support. For bulls, holding this level is essential to confirm the continuation of LINK’s short-term uptrend. If LINK maintains support above the 200 EMA and builds momentum, the next significant hurdle lies at the $24 mark. Reclaiming this level in the coming days would likely trigger a massive breakout, opening the door for LINK to target higher resistance zones and potentially all-time highs. Related Reading: Solana Holds Crucial Level – Can SOL Push Above $200? However, failure to hold the 200 EMA as support could expose LINK to renewed selling pressure, pushing prices back toward local demand.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Weekly Chart Shows That Dogecoin Price Is Primed To Cross $11 In 2025, Here’s How",2025-01-02 19:00:34+00:00,"Crypto analyst Dima James has boldly predicted that the Dogecoin price could cross $11 in this new year. He alluded to DOGE’s weekly chart to explain why the foremost meme coin is well-primed to reach this price target.  Dogecoin Price Primed To Cross $11 This Year In an X post, Dima James predicted that the Dogecoin price could cross $11 this year and reach $11.71. The analyst made this prediction following his analysis of Dogecoin’s weekly chart. His accompanying chart showed trend lines, which he noted are mathematically calculated and placed to provide an idea of where DOGE could end year 4 of this current cycle.  Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Descending Triangle On The Daily Chart, Why $1.95 Is Important Alluding to the chart, Dime James noted that historically, the red line has consistently signaled the top in every cycle. Meanwhile, the line above the red one marks the exact cycle top in previous 4-year cycles (2017 and 2021). If history repeats itself, the crypto analyst believes this pattern will play out again this year, with the Dogecoin price reaching at least the red line, with the target above $11.  The crypto analyst noted that in previous cycles, the Dogecoin price has increased exactly 37x from the start of year 4 to the end of that same year. Dogecoin began this year at $0.31660. Therefore, if history rhymes, Dima James boldly predicted that the foremost meme coin will end 2025 at around $11.71, 37 times the price at the start of this year.  Dima James also raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price rising above $11.71. He noted that the red line for year 4 in 2025 begins at around $23 and increases over time. The line above the red one starts at $36 and also increases with time. The crypto analyst added that market participants can begin to expect this cycle’s peak depending on when Dogecoin reaches this red line.  A More Conservative Price Target Crypto analyst Master Kenobi provided a more conservative target for the Dogecoin price, suggesting it could top between $1.2 and $3.4 in this market cycle. He stated that if DOGE breaks past its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.74 by the end of January, it could potentially test the $1.2 area, which he marked with the yellow trend line on his accompanying chart.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Flag Pattern Says Crash Is Far From Over Despite Crash To $91,000 The analyst added that anything beyond the $1.2 Dogecoin price target would be a bonus, although not impossible. He remarked that if DOGE were to reach the orange line by the end of January, it would be valued at $3.4. The crypto analyst opined that the meme coin is unlikely to reach this target at this stage of the bull market.  At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.33, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Solana, one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, joined the rally, surging over 10% in just 24 hours. This upward momentum is sparking renewed optimism among investors, with hopes that the market may be shifting toward a more bullish trend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Testing A Significant Support Zone – Bullish Breakout Ahead? Top analyst Jelle has weighed in on Solana’s recent price action, sharing a detailed technical analysis on X. According to Jelle, Solana’s next key hurdle is the $210 level. If SOL manages to reclaim this zone as support, the path to new all-time highs could quickly follow. This level represents a significant resistance point, making it a pivotal area to watch in the coming days. The market’s recent turnaround has brought fresh attention to Solana, as its technical setup positions it as a leader in this recovery phase. Investors closely monitor price action, eager to see if it can maintain the current momentum. As the broader market awakens, Solana’s next move could set the tone for its performance in the weeks ahead. Solana Showing Strength Solana has demonstrated notable resilience amid recent market turbulence, holding firm above the critical $180 level. This price point, which once posed significant resistance, has now flipped into robust support, underscoring Solana’s relative strength. As the broader crypto market begins to show signs of renewed optimism, Solana appears well-positioned for a significant upward move. Top analyst Jelle recently provided an encouraging technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana’s bounce from key levels. According to Jelle, SOL successfully retested both its trendline and horizontal support before rebounding sharply. This technical setup suggests that the asset is gearing up for a larger breakout. The next critical target lies at $210—a key resistance zone. Should Solana reclaim this level and consolidate above it, the door to new all-time highs would likely open. This bullish outlook is echoed by several analysts and investors who are closely watching Solana’s price action. Many believe that once SOL clears $210, its path to surpassing its previous highs will be swift and decisive. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Solana’s strong fundamentals, combined with its recent price performance, have made it a standout in the current market recovery. If momentum continues to build, Solana could become a leader in the next bullish phase, breaking its all-time high in record time. Technical Analysis: Key Levels   Solana (SOL) is trading at $207, showcasing remarkable strength following a clean bounce from the 200-day EMA at $175 on December 23. This bounce was pivotal, as holding the 200-day EMA confirmed a bullish price structure, ensuring that buyers regained control after weeks of market uncertainty. The successful defense of this critical level has positioned Solana as one of the most promising assets for an imminent breakout. Now trading above $200, Solana is on the cusp of testing its all-time high (ATH). If bulls can maintain momentum and reclaim the $230 mark, the subsequent move is expected to be aggressive. Analysts and traders are closely monitoring this level as it could act as the final resistance before SOL ventures into uncharted price territory. The bullish momentum is further bolstered by Solana’s strong fundamentals and its ability to hold key support zones amid broader market volatility. A breakout above $230 would likely attract fresh capital, fueling a rally that could redefine its long-term trajectory. Related Reading: Cardano Holds Crucial Support At $0.77 – Massive Rally Ahead?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Price Confirms Breakout: Analyst Sets New Price Targets,2025-01-02 16:00:43+00:00,"Crypto analyst Balo (@btcbalo) has highlighted a major technical breakout on the Dogecoin (DOGE/USD) chart that suggests a bullish trend in the near future. Balo’s analysis, based on a 4-hour chart, points to several key technical developments that are driving expectations of a continued upward movement of the Dogecoin price. Why Dogecoin Looks Poised To Rally A cornerstone of Balo’s assessment centers on Dogecoin’s decisive breach of a longstanding downtrend line on December 28. This downtrend line, originally established from the December 8 apex of $0.48, had served as a formidable resistance level, effectively dictating DOGE’s price movements throughout December. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst The breakout above this trend line marks a critical turning point. Following this ascent, Dogecoin experienced a minor retracement in which the memecoin swiftly retested the breached trend line. However, the retest was successful, reinforcing the bullish outlook for Dogecoin. Complementing the breakout from the downtrend line is the dissolution of a descending triangle pattern that had been forming since December 21. A descending triangle is characterized by a series of lower highs converging with a relatively flat support level, often signaling a potential bearish continuation. However, Dogecoin’s ability to break out of this formation today, on January 2 suggests a shift in market sentiment. The emergence from the descending triangle, coupled with the breakout, enhances the bullish narrative, although a retest of the triangle’s upper boundary could provide further validation of this upward trend. Integral to Balo’s thesis of a major breakout is also the volume profile, which offers a nuanced understanding of trading activity at various price levels. Dogecoin has rebounded from the substantial support at the highest volume cluster around $0.32, indicating a strong base of accumulated trading interest. Related Reading: Dogecoin Teeters Between ‘Price Discovery’ And ‘Catastrophe’: What’s Next? To the upside, volume is thin until the $0.40 region, where there is a huge cluster up to $0.43. This clustering implies that above this zone, DOGE could encounter minimal resistance, paving the way for Dogecoin to target its yearly high of $0.4834, recorded on December 8. Further reinforcing the bullish outlook is the completion of the ABC pattern on Dogecoin’s chart. The ABC pattern is a corrective sequence in technical analysis that typically signifies the termination of a retracement phase and the continuation of the preceding trend. In Dogecoin’s case, the finalization of this pattern aligns seamlessly with the other bullish indicators derived from the breakout and volume profile analysis.

Although it ended December just above the $2 mark, the XRP price went through a bullish period in the first half of the month, which saw it peaking around $2.9, its peak price in over six years.  Despite ending the month at a 28% decline from this six-year peak, XRP has nonetheless achieved the highest monthly candle body close in its history. This interesting phenomenon was noted by crypto analyst Tony Severino, who also suggested that the XRP price is on track to reach $13 this cycle. XRP Price Completes Highest Candle Body Close In History XRP ended December at a 6.94% gain from where it started, building upon an unexpected 281.7% increase in November, according to data from CryptoRank. This period of price increases saw XRP receiving considerable attention from crypto analysts and investors, with various predictions of a continued bullish momentum into 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Flag Pattern Says Crash Is Far From Over Despite Crash To $91,000 However, Bitcoin’s failure above the $100,000 price mark seems to have stalled XRP’s momentum alongside many other cryptocurrencies. This caused XRP to spend the latter half of December in a correction plus consolidation path. Nevertheless, the bullish trajectory remains valid for XRP, with recent technical analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino also lending voice to this. The XRP price registered its current all-time high of $3.40 in January 2018 but closed out the month at $1.124 to kickstart consecutive bearish candles on the monthly timeframe. As pointed out on the XRP monthly candles by Tony Severino, December 2024 was the highest monthly close for the XRP price. Although the cryptocurrency failed to break past its current all-time high during December, it managed to accomplish this notable milestone. While this isn’t much of a technical indicator, it lends voice to the lingering bullish momentum surrounding the XRP price, which has prevented further price declines below the $2 mark. Technical Analysis Points To $13 Price Target Crypto analyst Tony Severino also highlighted an interesting technical pattern playing out on XRP’s daily candlestick timeframe. According to the analyst, a bull flag seems to be emerging after XRP’s price correction in December.  Related Reading: Ethereum’s Large Consolidation Trend Points To Possible Price Explosion To $8,000 The bull flag pattern identified by Severino is a technical setup often associated with significant price surges. It is characterized by the steep upward movement in November, followed by a period of consolidation in a downward-sloping channel in December.  A breakout to the upside from the bull flag pattern typically leads to a continuation of the initial rally. In the case of XRP, Tony Severino projected a breakout that would see XRP surge to $13 in the coming months.  At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.37 and is up by about 12% in the past 24 hours. Reaching the projected $13 target would translate to a 450% gain from the current price level. Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Wealth Mentor Predicts XRP Path To $100 – Should You Invest Now?,2025-01-02 13:00:55+00:00,"A well-known and respected wealth mentor in the cryptocurrency world made a bold statement that has got people excited about XRP again. Wealth expert Linda Jones thinks the token could go up to $100 and tells buyers not to wait. Her mantra? “Don’t keep putting money away; put it away and wait.” Related Reading: XRP’s Path To $15: A Look At Historical Price Alignments The Power Of Early Investment Jones used a simple analogy to drive her point home. When XRP was priced at a paltry $0.25, an investment of just $100 would have given a person 400 tokens. Fast forward to the present when XRP trades near $2.36. The same $100 would hardly yield 50 tokens. Her argument emphasizes the value of entering early into promising assets. When we started investing in XRP, $100 bought 400 XRP. Today, $100 buys fewer than 50 XRP. Sometime in the future, it will buy 1 XRP. Don’t wait to invest, invest and wait! 😀 NFA pic.twitter.com/NtIB7Q3kqD — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 31, 2024 Seasoned investors find this idea appealing. Market expert Javon Marks feels the same way; he has stressed over and again the significance of finding cheap assets before their prices skyrocket. Can XRP Actually Hit $100? This is not without controversy, however: the token would need unprecedented demand to reach a valuation of $100, most likely through broad adoption in the global remittance sector. Clarity on regulatory matters and partnerships with major financial institutions would be pivotal in such growth. On-chain XRP activity is rising with transaction volumes and wallet activations, according to latest data. Critics say a $100 price point would require massive market capitalization, which is unachievable given current conditions. A Word Of Caution Although ambitious, Jones’s prediction is important to weigh against the volatile nature of the digital currency and memecoin markets. Positive forecasts attract investors even if they are never guaranteed. Recent events have made clear that market dynamics change overnight. Experts stress the importance of diversity and preparation when investing in crypto. The economy, risk tolerance, and market trends are all important factors to consider before making any investment. Current Market Trends On January 2, 2025, XRP has traded to $2.37, marking an excellent gain of 14% compared to its close the previous day. Intraday activity was churning at extremes of $2.44 on the highs and $2.09 on the lows, as this can clearly indicate a great deal of the token’s growth and risk trajectory. Related Reading: Shiba Inu 260% Rally: Analyst Sees Classic Bullish Patterns Emerging While the dream of XRP hitting $100 is very exciting, for now, it falls into the category of the speculative. Investors need to weigh the opportunities against the risks and remember that patience often pays off in the turbulent world of cryptocurrencies.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Crypto Predictions 2025: Dragonfly’s Managing Partner Unveils What’s Ahead,2025-01-02 11:30:57+00:00,"Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, outlined his crypto predictions 2025 via X, forecasting transformative trends that could significantly alter the crypto landscape. Here are the detailed insights from each of the key areas Qureshi covered: Crypto Predictions 2025 By Haseeb Qureshi #1 A Blurring Line Between L1s/L2s: In his crypto predictions 2025, Qureshi forecasts the diminishing distinctions between Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, forecasting a major consolidation within the blockchain industry. “The era of differentiating L1s from L2s based on technical capabilities is over. It’s now about carving out niches and enhancing user stickiness,” he declares. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Capitalizes On Elon Musk’s X Name Change For 17,000% Return This shift implies a future where strategic market positioning and user experience outweigh pure technological innovation. “EVM will not only retain its dominance but expand, driven by platforms like Base, Monad, and Berachain,” he further asserts. Qureshi credits this growth to the vast repositories of Solidity training data, which will empower language models to write advanced application code in 2025, marking a significant transition towards AI-driven development within blockchain ecosystems. #2 Better Token Launches: Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 also foresee a revolution in token distribution mechanisms. He sees the industry moving away from large-scale airdrops, which often prioritize quantity over quality of engagement. “We’ll see a more strategic approach, where token distribution is aligned with long-term user engagement and project viability,” he notes. For projects with clear metrics and defined goals, tokens will be used as tools to enhance user retention and incentivize meaningful interactions. Meanwhile, projects lacking concrete metrics will likely pivot towards structured crowdsales to build and maintain a dedicated user base. Furthermore, he predicts that “memecoins will continue to lose market share to AI agent coins. I consider this a migration from financial nihilism to financial over-optimism. (Yep I’m coining that.).” #3 Accelerated Stablecoin Adoption: Stablecoins are set to become a cornerstone of business transactions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) seeking reliable and instant financial settlements. “We’re on the brink of seeing SMBs broadly adopt stablecoins, driven not just by their efficiency but by increasing institutional trust and involvement,” Qureshi noted. He anticipates significant movements from banks, including new stablecoin launches as financial institutions seek to capture part of this burgeoning market. Moreover, he remarks, “With Howard Lutnick as Secretary of Commerce, institutional hesitance will decrease, securing Tether’s top position amidst growing competition.” He adds, “Expect Ethena to gobble up even more capital, especially as treasury yields continue to decline over the coming year. When the opportunity cost of capital declines, it makes basis trade yields even more attractive.” #4 A Cautious Regulatory Advance: The regulatory outlook within Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 suggests a mixed bag of advancements and setbacks. According to him, 2025 will witness evolving regulations, with specific legislation around stablecoins likely to pass in the US. Related Reading: Top Crypto Assets For Q1 2025: Grayscale Reveals The Best Altcoins However, comprehensive market reforms such as the Financial Innovation Technology of the 21st Century Act (FIT21) might face delays. “While we see the regulatory framework for stablecoins strengthening, broader financial technology reforms will lag, creating a piecemeal regulatory environment,” he predicts. Additionally, Qureshi foresees that Fortune 100 companies will become more willing to offer crypto to consumers under the Trump administration. “Trump’s inauguration will create a perceived regulatory jubilee until clear rules and enforcement priorities are set. During this window, expect to see aggressive expansion of crypto integration into Web2 platforms,” he remarks. #5 AI Agents Will Evolve Beyond The Hype: A significant portion of Qureshi’s crypto predictions 2025 involves the role of AI agents in reshaping the crypto landscape. He criticizes the current state of AI agents, suggesting, “Today’s AI agents are essentially sophisticated chatbots linked to cryptocurrencies. They lack true agency and are primarily designed for interactions rather than autonomous operation.” Despite these limitations, he believes the role of AI in crypto will grow significantly, moving from novelty to necessity. “AI’s capability to automate and enhance blockchain operations will lead to a software development renaissance, drastically lowering the barriers to entry for blockchain applications,” he forecasts. #6 Crypto x AI: Looking beyond 2025, Qureshi envisions a deeper integration between crypto and AI technologies. “As we refine AI capabilities and regulatory frameworks, crypto will increasingly facilitate AI operations, leading to autonomous agents conducting transactions and managing their own economies on blockchain networks,” he stated. This interplay is expected to revolutionize user experiences and operational efficiencies, paving the way for a new era of decentralized and autonomous digital ecosystems.

# 🚀 Helius Startup Launchpad

The Helius Startup Launchpad is a new program to turn Solana builders into full-fledged startup founders. 

Alongside engineering support, the program offers resources for fundraising, sales, and overall business strategy, which are critical areas that many early-stage crypto teams struggle with.

Benefit for participants include: 

* 8 months of free Business tier access on Helius
* Exclusive discounts and perks from industry-leading partners
* Mentorship from veteran Solana operators and investors
* Private working groups, educational sessions
* Introductions to top VCs

To qualify, founders should have some working product or proof of concept, although pre-seed or seed-stage teams (and even earlier) are also encouraged to apply. 

All Colosseum Accelerator founders will have automatic access to the launchpad.

By combining technical infrastructure with real-world mentorship, the Launchpad aims to help Solana startups accelerate product development and build a sustainable business.

# 💂‍♀️ Solflare Guards

Solflare’s new *Guards* feature tackles a major concern in the Solana ecosystem: malicious dApps, hidden tx fees, and unauthorized actions to exploit users. 

Guards provides real-time monitoring of every external transaction, automatically warning you if there’s anything suspicious such as airdrops that are actually wallet drainers, scam sites posing as legitimate apps, or token delegation exploits that slip under the radar.

Guards even helps protect hardware wallets like Ledger and Keystone when they’re connected. 

This higher level of trust and safety will help encourage broader adoption of Solana-based projects, strengthening the entire ecosystem.

# Unchained

2024 was a transformative year for Solana. With a surge in developer activity, bold innovations in DePIN, and its ambitions to become a “decentralized Nasdaq,” the ecosystem is making waves.

But are these changes enough to differentiate it from competitors like Ethereum and L2 solutions such as Base?

In this episode, Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, and Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, join Unchained to discuss how Solana is carving out its niche.

They debate whether Base is a serious contender, why they’re not concerned about the 2025 token unlocks, and how Solana’s unique approach to MEV could shape its future.

Plus, they tackle the ecosystem’s broader challenges and why they believe Solana’s vision will endure.

Reddit,solana,I lost my home trading solana memecoins,2025-01-03 00:07:37,"
I’m from a small EU country where property prices are ridiculously high compared to our average income.

Seeing many people making life-changing amounts of money—$10k is life-changing for me—on meme coins made me want to try and trade them, hoping I might be one of the lucky ones someday.

I thought that, by starting small and being cautious, I could generate enough profit with a modest investment (less than $1k) to eventually afford a house and start a family. Technically, I haven’t lost our house, but I haven’t been able to fulfill my dream of buying one through trading memecoins, which, in hindsight, was an absurd idea to begin with.

Even if you manage to make a small gain, you can lose it all in seconds with one wrong decision.

Right now, I’m down to just $1 in my wallet because I made the wrong choices 80% of the time.

This post is for anyone thinking about diving into this mess hoping to make big profits. Please, don’t. You have to be incredibly lucky to make money with shitcoins as an average person. In the end, you’re just providing liquidity for the already rich shitcoin insiders.",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404
Reddit,solana,Bullx Neo Wallet tracking alert panel settings exist?,2025-01-02 13:01:49,"Hey guys. I use the wallet tracking alerts in BullX neo. Partly because it’s very fast for a free tool, party because it’s a one-click to open the chart and trade. 

There is one thing that I can’t figure out. Is there any way to keep alerts open and pin it to a side bar or something? I find that BullX is laggy at times and I would love to have the Alerts open constantly and not something that I manually open and pops over the chart data blocking a site interaction. 

Hoping someone else has a solution. I know I could use a standalone external tracker but then I have to copy and paste coin addresses and look up charts in the search bar and that few seconds of time lost can sometimes be a 5-10 percent move. 


If anyone knows how to dock the alerts and pin to a side bar or some other way to keep the window open at all times that would be a huge help. Thanks!!",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,solana,"AI Agents and why they will relevant even more in 2025, including my pick for 2025.",2025-01-02 12:38:23,"AI agents are generating a lot of buzz in the crypto world, and while some of it might be typical bull market hype, there's a genuine shift happening beneath the surface.

# The Evolution from Bots to AI Agents

Bots have been around in DeFi for a while, automating repetitive tasks based on predefined scripts. They execute functions when certain conditions are met but are limited by the parameters set by their creators.

AI agents, however, are a different breed. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), they possess a higher level of intelligence, understanding context, learning from data and interactions, evolving, adapting, and carrying out tasks autonomously. It's automation with a touch of autonomy, almost like a glimpse of sentience.

# The Origin Story: Terminal of Truths

To understand why AI agents are gaining traction, let's look at the story of Truth Terminal. This Twitter account interacted with Marc Andreessen, founder of a16z, who sent Truth Terminal a $50K grant as an experiment. Truth Terminal, acting entirely on its own, adopted a memecoin called $GOAT and began spreading its message without any human intervention. This marked a significant difference between bots and agents: Truth Terminal displayed intelligence and intentionality.

# The Emergence of Web4

This development has led to the creation of a new category in crypto, blending incentives (crypto), AI (deep tech), and humor (memes). Some are already calling this Web4:

* **Web1**: Read-only. People consume information on the internet.
* **Web2**: Read-write. People contribute, creating a vastly expanded web.
* **Web3**: Read-write-own. Crypto and blockchains introduce enforceable ownership of contributions.
* **Web4**: Read-write-own-sentiate. AI agents take over the web, interacting with the world and each other autonomously.

In this new world, developers' roles will shift from creating products to training agents, helping them grow, adding functionality, and enabling them to interact with broader environments. These agents will handle the rest, potentially unlocking an entirely new economy — the AI agent economy.


# Real-World Impact

AI agents can transform how we interact with both the onchain and online worlds. They can simplify complex tasks, provide detailed explanations of applications, execute transactions, and offer market analysis. This automation will free users to focus on what truly matters.

# Limbo AI: A Game-Changer

One AI agent that stands out is Limbo AI from Today The Game. Despite facing some launch setbacks, Limbo AI has shown immense potential. It leverages generative AI-powered intelligent NPCs (non-player characters) to create realistic and dynamic interactions in the game. Unlike traditional social simulation games, Limbo AI's NPCs mirror genuine human-like conversations, enhancing player immersion.

Limbo AI's use case is particularly compelling in the gaming industry. It allows players to create their own agents, adding fun and utility elements to the game. The platform's commitment to community engagement and continuous improvement makes it a promising player in the AI agent space.

Reddit,solana,(Unpopular opinion) Tax is a good thing and Pump.fun culture is severely lacking because it doesn't employ tax.,2025-01-02 06:36:47,"Yeah, may see some hatred for this but it's honestly the truth. Here's why having tax as an option is a good thing, and why pumpfun culture is lacking in terms of depth.

1) **Tax Culture Thrives:** teams with funds uplift snipers, connectors, consultants, coders, bot devs, mods, artists, web designers, raiders—in tax culture, anyone can make $60-80K/year as an entry-level Telegram moderator.

2) **Variety:** ETH has memecoins, tokenomics plays, LARPs, utilities, competition coins, treasury tokens, and more.  Pumpfun has memecoins. The reason? Tax.

3) **Innovation:** utility might not *need* tax, but it makes a huge difference. Without tax, developing utility means dumping your own supply, which isn’t sustainable.

4) **Transparency:** you’re already paying tax—it’s just through team sells. Tax allows teams to generate revenue transparently in very very small, spread-out increments. It brings accountability and a visible marketing wallet for holders.

5) **Strategy:** teams with money adds strategy, it replaces the luck of the SOL with competitive fields.  You want to make $300k/year?  Sure, anyone can do it in tax culture, you just need to put in the work.

I have a proposal for render and Solana 

Thousands of projects are being developed on Solana. 

And many of these are ai projects that need compute.

Render should collaborate with Solana developer’s to create an easy integration where all Solana developers have access to render’s network of gpu’s

And as solana’s biggest Ai/DePin project it would make sense to use render.

This way all Solana projects would be able to access render gpu’s with just a few clicks.

Reddit,solana,The Real Reason I Quit BullX: Fees,2025-01-01 18:45:17,"Alright, let me be real with y’all. I didn’t hate BullX at first. It worked, the interface was fine, trades went through—no major complaints. But then I started noticing this sneaky little problem that kept piling up: **fees.**

At first, I didn’t even pay attention. I thought, “Oh, it’s just part of trading.” But when I finally sat down and added it all up? Bruh, I was losing **hundreds** a month. And it wasn’t even like I was trading with huge bags! Just regular trades, slowly bleeding me dry.

So, I started asking around, lurking on forums, and one name kept popping up: *Sniperoo.* I figured, why not? Opened [sniperoo.app](http://sniperoo.app), checked it out, and saw they had fees as low as **0.845%**. For context, BullX was hitting me with 1%+ almost every time.

Switched over, deposited some SOL (super easy), and started trading. And now? My profits actually feel like *my* profits. I’m not watching a chunk of every win disappear into the void.

Look, I’m not here to sell you on anything, but if you’re tired of paying ridiculous fees, maybe it’s time to rethink your setup. Sometimes, the “just deal with it” attitude is what keeps us stuck.

That’s my rant. Anyone else out there ditch BullX and feeling the same relief?

Reddit,solana,My Trading Experience: How I Finally Found the Right Tools for the Job,2024-12-31 19:38:19,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my trading journey and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. It’s been a bit of a ride, and I think some of you might relate.

For a while, I thought the key to trading was just about spotting the next big opportunity—like you can just jump in and make profits. But what I quickly realized was that **tools matter more than you’d think**.

When I started out, I didn’t realize how much the platform and fees were eating into my profits. I used to trade on a well-known exchange, but I noticed that no matter how well I did, I was always getting hit with those dreaded fees. At first, I didn’t care too much, but over time, those fees added up—especially when I started scaling up my trades. I was losing more to fees than I was making off my gains!

Then came the lag. I’d set up my trades and come back to see they hadn’t executed because of slow processing times. You know that feeling when you just missed a good opportunity? Yeah, I had a lot of those moments.

What really tipped me over the edge, though, was the hassle of managing multiple wallets. I was constantly switching between platforms, keeping track of balances, and manually checking each one. It was chaotic.

So, I decided to try something new. I stumbled across a platform called **Sniperoo** (shoutout to them), and I figured, why not give it a shot?

I’m honestly so glad I did. The first thing I noticed was how fast the trades were going through—under a second. No more lag, no more missed opportunities. Plus, the wallet management was so much smoother. I could keep track of all my trades in one place without constantly flipping between tabs.

And the best part? The fees are a fraction of what I was paying before. I’m saving so much more now, which means my profits actually feel like profits.

If you’re like I was—struggling with fees, lag, and managing everything manually—I really recommend checking out Sniperoo. It’s been a total game-changer for me.

And yeah, if you’re curious, using a referral code brings the fees down to **0.845%**—it’s a nice little bonus. Seriously, it's worth checking out if you’re looking to take your trading to the next level.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience. Hope it helps someone!",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,solana,How to prevent front runners from front running your own coin on pumpfun,2024-12-30 22:19:55,"Before I start all this, I know this is all gambling and most people lose money, but sometimes I like to just create a coin on pumpfun for either testing purposes or just to try my luck even though I know it's very hard to actually get a coin to raydium all by yourself without using bots etc.

  
Anyways what I wanted to say is that everytime or most of the times I create a coin and want to be the first one to buy my own coin, bots are front running it. I have so far only been buying my own coins trough the pump fun website itself and was wondering if there is any other way of buying my own coin without bots front running me.

Is it possible to create a coin on pumpfun without buying it immediately and then after creating it buy the coin using a bot (for example bullx) and set the slippage to 0%? Will that prevent front runners or are there better ways to do this? Thanks for the answers.",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

# [Announcing the Helius Startup Launchpad](https://www.helius.dev/blog/helius-startup-launchpad)

Helius' mission is to increase the economic potential of the world’s developers through crypto.

Today, we're launching the [Helius Startup Launchpad](https://www.helius.dev/startup-launchpad) to accelerate crypto's most ambitious startups.

Why? Many crypto founders excel at engineering but fall short across sales, fundraising, and business ops.

The Helius' developer platform helps you ship code, but the Helius Startup Launchpad helps you build a business.

We’re partnering with Solana’s top investors and operators to provide early-stage startups with the support they need to accelerate.

# What's the Problem?

Solana builders are highly technical but lack the experience needed to form an actual business. We've noticed that our customers are often talented engineers, but need help on sales, go-to-market, and even legal. A business requires a cross-functional effort across sales, hiring, fundraising, operations, legal, marketing, support, and engineering. And it must do this while relentlessly searching for PMF. This is no easy task, which is why founders must focus on it above all else. With Helius, we already give you all the technical tools you need to succeed, but that's not enough. With this launchpad, we will further help you with mentoring, support, and ecosystem integrations so that you get your time and money back to keep iterating on product.

# What We Offer

We’ve curated experts across every discipline and steep discounts to help you quickly launch your product on Helius and grow your company with confidence.

More specifically, this program provides:

* 8 months of free Business tier access
* Exclusive discounts from our partners
* Mentorship from veteran Solana operators
* Access to private working groups and education
* Warm intros to crypto's most influential investors

Our current investor and accelerator partners include Chapter One, Founders Fund, Foundation Capital, Haun Ventures, 6th Man Ventures, Propel, Solana Ventures, Colosseum, and the Solana Labs Accelerator.

We also have support from teams like Squads, Sphere, Ottersec, Moonpay, Artemis, Dynamic, and more.

# Who Should Apply

While every team is encouraged to apply, this program isn't for everyone.

This program is for founders who build for the long term.

We’re looking for teams that have some combination of the following:

* Have a working product
* Are a pre-seed or seed stage company (or earlier!)
* Graduated from other web3 accelerators
* Won or placed at recent Solana hackathons
* Are referred by well-known VCs or angel investors

If this sounds like you, [apply now](https://form.typeform.com/to/uShCvuLv).

# Become a Partner

If you’re an investor, angel, or startup-enabling company we want to help accelerate your portcos. We also want to work with companies offering essential products and services to early-stage crypto startups.

By joining the Helius Startup Launchpad as a partner, you:

* Get early access to Solana’s most promising young startups
* Shape the development of next-generation crypto applications
* Join an exclusive network of industry leaders and decision-makers

If you’re interested in working with Solana's best startups and providing exclusive discounts, co-working spaces, mentorship, intros, or training, [become a partner](https://form.typeform.com/to/murJcQm2).

# Ready to Build?

Never before in history has the builder had such leverage to move the world.

In crypto, with a few lines of code, you can:

* move millions of dollars around the Earth at the speed of light
* create unstoppable, global capital markets
* architect entire economies

All without permission.

The Internet enables the flow of information across the globe—crypto turns information into value and value into information.

The startup is now as powerful as the nation-state. Or at least, it has the potential to be. All startups can now contribute to the global economy and accelerate progress. But this is no easy task, for they must also fight against physics, incumbents, and time.

**If you're interested in this fight,** [**apply now**](https://form.typeform.com/to/uShCvuLv)**.**

possibility to add wallets. when an added wallet user buys the first new meme coin get 1 alert only. not interested in the other buys this user wallet does on the same token.

an alert when 3 or 4 more users wallets that i follow, buys the same meme coin in a span of 5 minutes. 

if i add the trade, i like to set a take profit with alarm on it. also if i add a take profit on it , will that take profit be visible for everybody else on the trade platform? , incase people what to go stop loss hunting and kill the coin just before it hits take profit levels.

make a set file with trades beforehand and when a price hit a certain price point. the moment it hits ,give an alarm, i load a set file and it executes the trades on certain price levels right now, like a grid setup.

if this is not possible, could it then be possible that i create a bot that can do this and then add it on a trade platform? ",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,solana,Wrote my own Shitcoin Trading Bot in Python,2024-12-29 19:36:20,"Hey everyone, noticed another similar post, and wanted to post my efforts that I've been working on for the past 7 months. I'm not one to really shill anything, but wanted to put this out there as I know some people here might be interested in this. I've been working on an open-source premium trading bot project and already put out some free tutorials to help everyone get started on creating their own. These types of bots typically sell for ridiculous amounts, and I'm just looking to shake things up in this market as I really don't like the way some of these guys try to monopolize things.

A little bit about me:

Born and raised in the US. I've been in the software engineering field for over 20 years and have led small-mid size software teams throughout my career on successful projects. Now, I train software devs and make dev tutorials to benefit the community on the side. I took a real interest in crypto around 2022 when I saw a yahoo article on someone who made 20 mil on BOME lol. Naturally. I wanted to see what the hell was going on here, so I did my own DD and have been in the trenches ever since. Researching some of the best traders in the game, I realized a lot of what they were doing was very time consuming, but very necessary. With my Software background, I realized a lot of it could be automated, so I started working on building out this project with the intent on making passive income. I hit some roadblocks, as documentation and resources are lacking in this area and ChatGpt/Claude turned out to be not much help either. It took some time, but I eventually figured things out on my own, and thereafter, decided to share some of my developments with the community!

A few months ago, I started putting out free tutorials on how to create a basic bot from scratch in just a few days, and the feedback has been great so far, albeit my following is very low right now. Honestly, I started doing this all for fun really. Don't need handouts, and am financially stable. Not dropping any links, moderators are trigger happy on banning posts here.

Strangely, the address IS a SOL address. 4Vu4fzRtLGjH97uHkuN5Qa6rt8UFqvWBaAKqbLJovqZK - it's named ""System Program""

Why would I have a SOL address aside from my own in my clipboard? I've used my cut/past at least 8-10 times today, but have not sent any SOL aside from this withdrawal.

First, are these 4 SOL permanently lost? Second, any ideas HOW I would get that address in my clipboard from within Phantom Wallet? Or maybe I pasted the right address and Binance screwed up? Even if I've lost the SOL, I want to figure out how I did this.

Edit: I guess these SOL are gone. Still have no idea how I pasted an address I'd never heard of into the Binance website, I never knew it existed until today.

Edit: Thanks for the clipboard hijacking ideas. Will research that now. ",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

I’m attempting to run an ethereum node on Evernode (evernode.org) by deploying the Docker version ethereum/ethereum:latest.

So far, I haven’t had any success. I suspect the issue might be related to the port configuration required for the node to communicate with the outside world. Do you have any tips or guidance?

You might be wondering why I chose Evernode for this. The idea of running a blockchain participation node on a platform powered by another blockchain (Evernode) is fascinating, and the pricing is incredibly low compared to other VPS options.

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

Please ask any questions you may have!  We have our next public goods funding round beginning January 11th.  To learn more about Octant, join our discord: [https://discord.com/invite/octant](https://discord.com/invite/octant) ",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404
Reddit,ethereum,The Next Upgrade and Global Adoption 2025,2025-01-02 05:29:45,"##**Tech and upgrades coming in 2025**

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,ethereum,Those living in Canada: Do you save up in USDC?,2024-12-28 18:33:37,"Hi!

With the decline of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, are you considering creating your emergency fund in USD?
For sure, you can open an USD account in a traditional bank but do you also consider buying USDC (or other tokens)?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to have a discussion regarding **how relevant (or nor) is it to save up in USDC for a Canadian.** I know a lot of Canadians are already investing in USD anyway.
**Does saving up directly on a USD stablecoin make any sense?**


How I see it:

**Advantages**
- less fees (maybe not, I really don't know what are the fees for a USD account opened in Canada)
- easy to buy 

**Disadvantages**
- **taxes implications?** If you pay your transaction fees in ETH, technically you may have to pay taxes on it (depending on your ACB). Plus, since ERC-20 tokens are considered assets in Canada, you should pay taxes if you make a gain when you spend your USDC (*if USD(C)/CAD goes up in value across time, which is the current consensus*)
- **not easy to spend USD** outside of Crypto space (but crypto cards are democratizing)",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to run a state only node ?,2024-12-28 12:11:33,"Hey,

I'm not really sure how different Ethereum is from Bitcoin in client logic. From my understanding, there are transactions and state (smart contract values, etc...).

In my case, I need to access the read-only features of some smart contracts without spending too much on hardware. 

My current solution was to use an rpc provider, request the state of contract x, then listen for new blocks and update the state on my end based on the transactions received. This is necessary to avoid hitting rate limits, as my usage uses a large number of requests.

The problem is that the ""sync"" part can take days with the current rate limit because I'm using contract calls, which probably isn't the best solution. So I wanted to know if it was possible to run a node without the whole blockchain, just with the state, the goal is not to verify transactions but to know more efficiently the state of specific contracts.

Do you know if this is possible? if not, is it difficult to create my own implementation to request this directly on the network like real nodes do, and include my logic instead?

A kind of ethereum client that  sync only a specific part of the state and does not store or verify transactions",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404
Reddit,ethereum,Can somebody explain how people are still paying $23 or over that for gas fees in the second half of 2024?,2024-12-27 17:18:42,"Hi. I was just following an ETH thread in the cryptocurrency subreddit and various people are claiming they are paying about $30 or even more than that for their gas fees for L1 transactions.

For example, [I saw this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hm4k11/comment/m3tigd0/
):

> Yeah I try to swap $45 worth of ETH for a coin I want and it's costing me $23 gas fees. No thanks. 

I have read other comments in the past few weeks of people still paying something like upper $20 range for gas fees, and I assume their transactions were recently?

How is this possible though?  Checking the gas fee chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#1y, the highest average gas fee in the last 6 months was $14 USD on November 13th.  The gas fee has generally been lower than that in the last 6 months for Ethereum.

I haven't seen any average gas fee over $20 USD since March of 2024 according to that chart.  So how are people still paying like $23, or even in the upper $20 range for their gas fees lately?",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,ethereum,Beginner confused about networks,2024-12-26 11:16:47,"Hi all, 

I’m fairly new to crypto and find the networks quite overwhelming. 

I can choose from Ethereum (ERC20), Optimism, Arbitrum One, or Base network. 

Unfortunately I do not know the difference between these - all I know, is I don’t want to pay the exorbitant fees from the ERC20 network. 

Can I just randomly choose the same low fee network on my sending and receiving end, or is there a process to using other networks, e.g., buying supporting coins for a transaction? 

I also noticed the differing networks have their own amount of eth storage. If you send eth using a specific network, it’ll stay on that network forever? You can never combine all your eth? 

Are there any negatives of using different networks to avoid exorbitant fees?

As you can see, I’m quite confused, any help would be much appreciated!!

Thanks ",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404
Reddit,ethereum,Looking for a library of known ETH addresses (like ones owned by exchanges etc),2024-12-26 11:24:01,"Hey all,  
My brother has discovered that his Edge wallet has been completely emptied.   
A few hours after he deposited his ETH (in 2021), they were all transferred to an unknown address.  
The address is 0x3c681f08353c39c0fcea3a04a56f381796bce7e8  
And according to its history it may be an exchange deposit wallet. It has transacted a total volume of $128M, which looks organizational to say the least. 

I'm now trying to understand if I can associate this address with a known entity and investigate further.   
Does anyone have an idea where to look?

Thanks!",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,ethereum,Can’t sell contract - anyone shed some light on this?,2024-12-23 08:20:10,"Hi

Someone in an alpha shilled this CA at $60k MC. Bought a bit of it through sushiswap:

Reddit,ethereum,PoS vs. PoW: Energy Efficiency – Is That All? ,2024-12-22 19:15:06,"The blockchain was supposed to be this revolution of trust, decentralization, and equity; instead, here we are, debating the use of Proof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS). Let me break it down.



The original blockchain model is Proof of Work, think Bitcoin: where miners solve complex puzzles in the interest of securing a network. It is power-hungry: just Bitcoin, in and of itself, uses 91 TWh per year-the equivalent of several small countries. Kudos to temper some criticism for its environmental impact.



This, in turn, ushers in the green replacement through PoS. It operates with validators who stake their tokens by way of miners for locking up the network. After ETH moved into PoS in 2022, its energy usage went down by 99.95%. Great, huh? But here is the kicker: most PoS networks have a tendency to centralize power amongst the richest validators; hence, it's at great risk in regard to fairness and security.



So, is it all about energy, or is energy efficiency just a smoke screen for deeper trade-offs in scalability, regulatory compliance, or control?  

 Fact: It is that both systems are saddled with their strong points and weaknesses.  

 PoW is ultra-secure and battle-tested; it is very power-consuming. 

 PoS is scalable, efficient, and user-friendly but has its own risks in centralization.



It's not really a question of choosing over another; it's all about innovation. Hybrid systems, such as NCOG Earth Chain, already mix in security from PoW and efficiency from PoS, renewable energy, and sustainability goals in their quest for that perfect balance. 



It all boils down to energy: building blockchains that uphold decentralization, fairness, and transparency in this ever-changing world.



Well, what do you think about it? Do we resolve actual problems or scratch where it doesn't itch? Leave a comment below.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about reconstructing rollups state,2024-12-21 12:56:14,"Hi!

I'm not sure to understand sequencers correctly.
 
Is it possible to reconstruct the state of an L2 only based on rollups smart contracts on L1, without any L2 node existing?

As far a as I understand, we need at least 1 honest node to do so because:
- L2's sequencer only posts compressed data and proof on L1
- the detailed transactions are maintained by the nodes and operators on L2
- technically, a new node could confirm the new state is valid by checking the last merkle root posted on L1, but couldn't derive history of transactions based on the L1 smart contract only.

Am I right?",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,ethereum,A history of grants and public goods funding on the blockchain,2024-12-19 17:11:44,"The Ethereum grants ecosystem, unsurprisingly begins with the Ethereum foundation. In April of 2015, the EF launched [ÐΞVgrants.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/07/devgrants-help) DEVgrants offered funding strictly to existing projects which contribute to both the ""Ethereum platform"", and projects based on Ethereum. The nature of this grants scheme was pretty standard and not particularly innovative. It was quite simply a grants scheme where grantees made a submission outlining their plans and estimated costs which was reviewed by a board of EF team members and funding was released either upon achieving milestones or partially upfront and partially upon completion. So the TL;DR is that it's nothing too exciting yet. Just simple incentives to get people building with pretty standard terms and conditions which you'd also find for grants outside of the web 3 ecosystem.

Not a lot happened through the next year, but a couple of important things happened in 2016 which lay the foundation for the future of the grants ecosystem. First, in the latter half of 2016, Giveth was founded by Griff Green, Jordi Baylina, and a few other members of the White Hat Group. They would soon after launch Giveth, an on-chain donation and crowdfunding service in 2017 which saw a modest amount of use. At the same time throughout late 2016 and 2017, ICOs started raising obscene amounts of ETH. So much ETH that one of the largest funders of public goods to this day, the Golem Foundation raised 820,000 ETH. That's a whopping 0.66% of all ETH in existence today! However, at $10/ETH in November 2016, it was only $8.7M which is paltry by today's standards or even 2017 standards. But we'll get back to Giveth and Golem later...

By the time 2018 rolled around, the bull market full of false promises evolved into a brutal bear and for many people that means it's a build market. In March, the EF did another big round of grants funding. This time, with 13 projects receiving a combined total of $2.5M. This was still a shadow of the money available today, but a nice boost for many projects. However, the big news this year was a research paper written by Vitalik, Zoë Hitzig and E. Glen Weyl in September of 2018. [""Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds""](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656), or as we know it today, quadratic funding or quadratic matching.

Quadratic funding proposes that when funds are to be allocated, individuals within a community can vote for the project by contributing funding to the projects and causes they prefer. Then each vote is weighted using a quadratic function to find a balance between large donors having more influence and smaller donors having their voice heard. That way, more funds will go to Project A which received 100 x $1 donations than Project B which received one single $100 donation. This is more effective because Project A clearly benefits more people, whereas Project B simply benefits one person a lot. This prevents wealthy individuals from having an outsized influence on the distribution of public goods funding and leads to a more democratic outcome while still incentivising large donors to contribute to public goods to have more influence over the funding distribution.

Quadratic funding transitioned from research to reality in 2019 with the launch of Gitcoin. Gitcoin has been running quarterly rounds since then which involve a large pool of matching funds and a large number of projects for the community to donate to. Gitcoin then uses quadratic matching to allocate the main pool funds to the projects depending on the nature of how many people donated how much to each project. The matching funds originally were primarily EF funded but over time this scope has grown to large ecosystem players like Polygon, Chainlink and even outsider organisations for non-crypto project rounds like UNICEF. Since 2019, Gitcoin has funded over 6,000 different projects and allocated over $63M in funding. Nowadays, Gitcoin is a pillar of public goods funding in Ethereum and after tweaking and experimenting, they have learned some lessons about public goods funding and have taken those lessons into account for creating Allo Protocol. Allo Protocol is an open-source, decentralised, modular protocol to enable efficient and transparent allocation of pooled capital on-chain, thus allowing other communities to institute their own quadratic funding more easily.

Stepping back a bit after our quadratic tangent, after the launch of Gitcoin, the next key points in the development of the grants and funding ecosystem came in the 2020 and 2021 bull run. This is when the funding ecosystem started to properly bloom, but it would take a few years for that to fully play out and we're still working on some novel solutions to the problems which arose from this period today. With the influx of new projects, lots of VC funding and particularly L2 ecosystems and apps which are all in an arms race to build out the biggest ecosystem first, there was an explosion of more simple milestone based grants for funding, this time primarily for ecosystem specific grants. The result is that builders are spoiled for choice for places to build and get funding. On the other hand, it can also be a bit overwhelming. Here to help you with where you can get funding is [Ecosystem.vision](https://ecosystem.vision) and [KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/projects), both of whom have a large database of nearly all of the ongoing grants and funding opportunities in the wider web 3 space. But more on KarmaGAP later as we have two more noteworthy innovations from 2021 to cover.

Also born out of the 2021 bull run is Optimism's retroactive public goods funding (RPGF). Unlike a lot of ecosystems and L2s which offered grants for project building in their respective ecosystems, Optimism opted for another strategy. Rather than funding speculative projects which might make an impact, they instead look towards retroactive funding of impactful projects as voted on by Optimism governance. They make the case that it is more effective and efficient to fund successful projects after the fact, letting prospective builders know that if they build something useful without the expectation of profits, they will be rewarded. The history of their funding rounds could warrant a post of its own, but essentially they have slowly *optimised* ^^(heh) their mechanisms. Most recently opting for more focused, themed rounds to constantly change who the recipients are and to minimise the same people with the best networks and brand recognition from being repeatedly rewarded and sometimes over-rewarded. Finally, while I was talking face to face with Karl Floersch from Optimism at Devcon 7, in true Karl fashion, he excitedly and confidently expressed his excitement for their next big development in the RPGF space which he thinks will be an a real game changer for public goods funding. While I received no hints as to the nature of this next evolution, given Optimism (formerly Plasma Group)'s history, I am expecting good things to come from this. So watch this space.

Finally, we return to Giveth. After many years of facilitating a modest amount of crowdfunding and donations, Giveth launched the $GIV token with an airdrop to previous donors, contributors, and collaborators. With it comes the V2 version of Giveth known as the GIVeconomy which uses tokenomic incentives to encourage donations. The TL;DR is that donors get kickbacks referred to as GIVbacks in the form of the GIV token. The token is then used in governance for the protocol and also in deciding how to spend the project's significant (in terms of total GIV supply) treasury of GIV tokens. Unfortunately, the inflationary tokenomics have lead to a pretty catastrophic price chart, but many projects have been helped from Giveth funding and while not as prolific or impactful as Gitcoin, they've been a leader in terms of experimentation and there's still a core community there. In 2024, they raised a respectable $1.55M for projects. Looking forwards, they're also looking to build out integrate a new feature involving augmented bonding curves which is probably out of the scope of this post but should help with the sustainability of funding projects receive.

Finally, we get to the ongoing work being done by KarmaGAP (the GAP means Grants Accountability Protocol). KarmaGAP is trying to solve two key problems:

- How do you ensure that grant money is spent effectively and that the people you give money to actually use it to do what they say they will?

- The current web 3 grant ecosystem is incredibly fractured and developers don't have time to maintain profiles and fill in forms across dozens of websites and grants platforms in the name of *maybe* receiving funding.

KarmaGAP aims to be the industry standard in grants and funding accountability. By having projects post updates there, the idea is that they will no longer need to post updates to half a dozen different websites, each of which want different formats when checking in on project progress and how grant money has been spent. This allows donors to easily check the reputation of projects/grantees to allow them to get more funding and it allows projects/grantees to save time applying for and reporting back to grantors.

**Now that we're all up to date, who are the main players you should know about when funding your project?**

- Gitcoin - Claim your share of large matching pools powered by quadratic funding every quarter.

- Octant - Funded by 100,000 staked ETH raised by the aforementioned Golem ICO, Octant runs regular quadratic funding rounds much like Gitcoin. GLM token holders who lock their tokens in Octant can influence project selection and earn ETH rewards. Users can then choose to keep their rewards or donate them to eligible public goods projects, with donations amplified through a matching pool.

- Optimism Retroactive Public Goods Funding - Optimism's RPGF rounds are very large and they're a key innovator in the space. While their current rounds are narrow in scope, keep an eye our for future rounds and innovations which everyday builders may qualify for.

- KarmaGAP - Make your project's profile here to build up your reputation and get more success in receiving funding from all of the different players in the grants ecosystem.

- Ecosystem.vision - The most comprehensive list of grants opportunities. Now featuring an AI tool to help search for relevant grants based on the nature of your project.

My goal is to provide a space where users can be creative, while exploring wallets and blockchain technology without worrying about investments or risks.

Here’s the idea in a nutshell:



* The canvas is infinite, with each cell holding a stack of images on the z-axis. Only the top image is visible (in 2D mode).
* You can place your image on the canvas by paying a small fee in ETH to each owner of an image below yours (0.0001 ETH per owner). The more layers there are below, the more it costs, but if other put an image on top of yours = you'll earn.

How to Test It:

	1.	Get some test ETH for Arbitrum Sepolia (write me a pm if you have no other means)

	2.	Connect your wallet (MetaMask, etc.) and head over to the site.

	3.	Create a 64x64 pixel image (RGB), upload it, and pick a spot on the canvas.

	4.	Experiment with the features—stack images, explore the canvas, and have fun!



I’d love for you to give it a try and share your feedback. Any thoughts, suggestions, or ideas for improvement are more than welcome. I would also appreciate it if someone could identify any security issues in the contract.



Excited for any feedback!

Reddit,ethereum,Decentralized Verified Identities?,2024-12-18 14:23:03,"Hi guys!

  
Want to get your opinion on a platform that let's you verify your identity once using official documents, and then let's you securely reuse that verified identity across platforms like Yelp, Airbnb etc without constantly uploading documents and re-verifying yourself?



The goal is to promote the use of verified identities across the web (better bot and spam protection), but without the ridiculousness (and privacy concerns) of having to upload your verifying ID document on every site. 



Since it’s a dApp, you’d also have full control over your documents and verified identity - no centralized entity holding your data.  


Would love to hear your thoughts!",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,ethereum,Looking for insight and direction for my project-Vereum,2024-12-18 18:46:18,"Vereum was launched on base in October. My initial thought was to use tax funds to gain enough traction to get the platform built and operational. This fell short will non preforming calls and my lack of how to properly communicate the idea.    
  
Vereum would be a new community based platform for all of web3. This would rebrand the traditional idea of social media to a social ledger that embodies innovation, creativity and learning in its core. It would have a ecosystem with various services for all users and gamified features  that would enhance community involvement such as a raid mechanism known as The Arena-amongst others.   
  
The idea is to create a real place for communities and projects to grow, thrive and be discovered. Communities in this space are fractured by all other platforms. They help draw in users over time, but what I want to build will cater to every aspect of blockchain and crypto communities by having a true ""home base"". 

The initial goal is building a knowledge base forum ( think reddit) but adding in aspects that amplify the needs of businesses, founders, startups and users. There are two style forums,-project and regular communities that are based on any topic. Both having their own and similar features to enhance experience.  
  
The platform would also add in tools to help remove some risk of buying into a project. This is where the knowledge base comes into play. We would also help new users to cyrpto have an easier transition to the space. In the long term we would expand past the web3 barrier and push to establish as a major platform.

I have a lot on paper for just about every aspect of the platform, but lack the technical capability to build and properly market. Since the launch (as some would expect) it has struggled to take off, and I know that's all on me. This is even more of a reason I want this to become a reality, as there are tons of great ideas out there, but people don't act on them bc of limitations.   
  
I have built somewhat of an mvp with [bolt.new](http://bolt.new) as this was the easiest way i could get me idea of the paper. It has most of the initial features I wanted, but they recently made some changes and a lot of projects are stuck in loops and I'm burning through tokens. 

I'm looking for insight on how to best find team members or investors that I can show of the idea and get help to move forward. Ideally team members would be set up with tokens and a vesting schedule or partnership.  
  
 The market need is ripe, if it can be built in the right way. I have an innovative and creative mindset, I just need the help to make this a true reality. 

Any input or direction is appreciated and thank you for your time.

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Earning bitcoin

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoin by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Every single bitcoin I acquired, I spent almost immediately on online stores. At the time, I didn’t see it as saving for the future—I saw it as just another currency to spend.

Now, at 32 years old, I’m finally starting my savings journey. It’s taken me a while to get here, but I’m genuinely excited about the idea of saving and building something for the future. Maybe, just maybe, I could one day acquire and hold 1 full bitcoin.

Over the years, I’ve spent more than 1 BTC—back when it was worth about $2,000 total. Looking back, it feels like I missed an opportunity, but instead of dwelling on that, I’m focused on changing my strategy.

From now on, I’ll treat bitcoin like digital gold—a store of value for my future self and perhaps even for my descendants. It’s never too late to start, right?

What advice would you give to someone just beginning their BTC savings journey?",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404
Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin is fundamentally simple. Here's how it works.,2025-01-01 22:43:42,"1. **Bitcoin Transactions:**
   * Transactions are made when users send Bitcoin to one another. Each transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
   * These transactions wait in the **mempool** (a temporary holding area) until they are included in a block by a miner.
2. **Blocks:**
   * A block is essentially a ""page"" in the Bitcoin ledger that contains a list of verified transactions.
   * Each block references the previous block through a cryptographic link (the hash of the previous block), forming a chain — the **blockchain** — which is the entire history of Bitcoin transactions.
3. **Miners' Role:**
   * Miners compete to create the next block by solving a cryptographic puzzle (Proof-of-Work).
   * The first miner to solve the puzzle adds the new block to the blockchain and broadcasts it to the network.
   * As a reward, the miner earns the **block reward** (newly minted Bitcoin) and **transaction fees** from the transactions in the block.
4. **Nodes' Role:**
   * Full nodes receive the newly mined block and **validate** it to ensure it follows Bitcoin's rules (e.g., no double-spending, proper block structure, valid transactions).
   * Nodes store a full copy of the blockchain and enforce consensus rules. They reject any invalid blocks or transactions.
   * By doing so, nodes ensure the network remains secure and decentralized. There are thousands of Bitcoin nodes around the world, many operated by individuals, businesses, and institutions making it impossible for anyone to change Bitcoin without the majority of these nodes agreeing to the change. 
   * **Bitcoin Nodes in Space**:
      * **Blockstream Satellite**: Blockstream has launched satellites into orbit that broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain to the entire Earth. This allows users to access Bitcoin without an internet connection, ensuring resilience during internet outages or censorship. Users only need a simple satellite dish and receiver to connect.
   * **EMP-Resistant Nodes**:
      * **Faraday Cage Nodes**: While specific examples of individual nodes aren't publicly advertised for security reasons, enthusiasts and businesses have built Bitcoin nodes inside Faraday cages to protect against EMPs. For instance, some survivalist communities incorporate EMP-hardened Bitcoin nodes as part of their disaster preparedness setups.
   * **Bunker Nodes**:
      * **The Swiss Fort Knox**: Several companies operate Bitcoin nodes in heavily fortified data centers, such as the ones buried deep in Swiss mountains. These facilities are designed to withstand natural disasters, EMPs, and even military attacks.
      * **The Underground Data Center in Stockholm**: Located in a former nuclear bunker, this facility houses Bitcoin nodes and other critical infrastructure, designed to survive extreme conditions.
   * **Decentralized Distribution**:
      * **Home and Business Nodes**: Many individuals run Bitcoin nodes in their homes or offices worldwide. While not as protected as the examples above, the sheer number of nodes (tens of thousands globally) ensures the network continues to function even if some go offline.
5. These examples highlight the extraordinary measures taken by Bitcoin users and organizations to ensure the network remains operational under any circumstances. 
6. **Decentralized Ledger:**
   * The blockchain, stored on nodes worldwide, acts as the official, tamper-proof record of Bitcoin's transaction history.
   * This decentralized ledger prevents any single entity from altering the history or rules of Bitcoin.

# Key Points to Remember:

* **Miners:** Create and propose new blocks by expending computational power.
* **Nodes:** Validate and store the blockchain, ensuring it adheres to Bitcoin’s consensus rules.
* **Blockchain:** A chronological and cryptographically secure ledger that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions.",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

The exchanges I've used are cumbersome. Logging in can be tricky, and occasionally, they flag security issues incorrectly, locking my account in the process. Contacting customer service for help has also been a challenge. 

If I'm correct, buying btc in larger quantities is more economical, as it minimizes ""gas"" fees. However, this means I would need to keep a substantial amount of money on a potentially unreliable online exchange until I make my purchase, and then transfer it to a cold wallet for safekeeping.

Additionally, I realize that selling btc would involve a similar process, which feels daunting. 

In summary, while I'm eager to buy more btc, the complexities of the buying and selling processes are making me hesitant.

Reddit,bitcoin,Noob question: BTC vs IBIT,2025-01-02 16:20:46,"Hi, first let me apologize for my ignorance regarding bitcoin as I'm sure this has been covered elsewhere. I just started to read the Bitcoin Standard so I am trying to learn more but I have 4  young kids and a business and its taking me longer that I would like so I am appealing to you all for help.

I have a few bitcoin that are just sitting at coinbase right now. As I am slowly learning more about bitcoin and crypto, Ive read that I should not leave them on an exchange. I bought a Trezor last week that is on its way here. 

So my plan was to move all my crypto off coinbase and onto my Trezor. I don't even know if moving directly from coinbase to trezor is possible but a friend said it was.

I am having doubt about my ability to do this correctly and to actually be able to verify my bitcoin is on this Trezor and that I will actually be able to recover it and access it and spend it when needed.

This is several hundred thousand dollars we are talking about. All of these concepts seem sort of foreign and scary to me so Im afraid I am going to mess it up.

  
Part of me is thinking to just sell all my bitcoin and other crypto at Coinbase and buy IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF) through Fidelity. This seems like something thats much more comforting to me in my mind because Ive been investing in ETFs at fidelity for a decade.

I know people like bitcoin because its possible to have it untraceable and because its antiFIAT and because bitcoiners like to be different, blah blah blah.

  
I guess Im looking for any feedback of why I should go one way or the other? Pros and cons to either decision. 



I feel like if I put my Bitcoin on trezor, it will keep me up at night thinkging about it getting hacked or somehow lost.",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

I simulated what it would have been like if I had used DCA with this tool [https://www.bitcoindollarcostaverage.com/](https://www.bitcoindollarcostaverage.com/) with the same total amount and surprise! I would have obtained less BTC with DCA, around 0.025 BTC difference over DCA.

I got a return of around 60% vs 40% if was use DCA.

Good, but the downside? It was stressful with constant decisions of ‘act now or wait?, you know ""time the market"".

Reddit,bitcoin,How I explained Bitcoin wallets to my 12 year old nephew.  Am I correct? ,2025-01-01 15:47:43,"
This is how I explained it to my nephew, please let me know if I’m way off…


Imagine a universe with an infinite amount of planets, more planets than there are atoms in the entire universe we live in. 
Each of those planets is a BTC wallet. 


When you generate a wallet, you’re essentially planting your personal flag on one of those planets and laying claim to it (you don’t create the planet - it already exists). You can store your digital assets right there on the surface of the planet, like treasure. 

Your planet can only be found with your private keys/seed phrase - it’s like a map. This map is the most important part of your wallet and must be protected at all times. A hardware wallet is basically a device that connects you directly to your planet, with your map built into it. It makes accessing your planet a lot easier. 
 
It’s highly unlikely anyone will ever land on your planet by accident as there’s just so many of them out there. 

 There’s space pirates out there who would love to land on people’s planets to steal their treasure, but it costs them too much money to travel from planet to planet - so it’s highly unlikely they’ll ever find one with treasure on it. 
Instead, these pirates try to trick people into giving them their map - That’s why it’s important to never share it with anyone, no matter what. 

Anyone can look at the planets (wallet addresses) through a telescope and see what’s on each planet, but they can’t get there without the map.

If you want to be extra-secure, you can use a passphrase wallet, which kinda creates an underground bunker on your planet. You can store your treasure in there, so if anyone does ever land on your planet, they’ll think it’s an empty one. You could even leave a small amount of funds on the surface as a trap, so you’ll know if anyone ever lands there. 

And to be even safer, you can lay claim to multiple planets, or create multiple underground bunkers on the same planet. The options you have are limitless. 

While nobody can access your planet, anyone can send funds there - it’s kinda like your planet has an email address. This is known as your wallet address or public keys. 


Is this a good analogy to make wallets more understandable for kids? 

Edit: Michael Saylor often refers to BTC as a bank in cyberspace, this is why I went with a space analogy. And thanks to all those who left positive comments!

I also researched to find out if my words were in some lists for mnemonic phrases but also didn't succeed.

So I am pretty sure that the phrase is correct, cause in 2014 I was a 13yo boy and just copy-pasted everything in notes.

Is it possible to recover it somehow? Scammers can walk away cause I am not a 13yo boy now:)

I just know that I had a wallet 10 years ago where I earned 6 bitcoins in very tricky ways:) and spent it all at the casino. But maybe this is a different wallet and I could get something from it.

I appreciate any help, thank you!

UPDATE: Somehow I guessed my old dumb password for my 10yo main email and I could login to [Blockchain.com](http://Blockchain.com), I had 2 id attached to the profile and I could get access to the newest one, but it's obviously was empty. But I couldn't reach the second id, I get the verification email but then it just shows me an error when login. So maybe I need more time to guess my another dumb password for that identifier. 

After login to my old mail I found out that my old Instagram and Twitter account were stolen (I don't care) and somebody even tried to make Icloud account with that email. I also got access to my old Freebitco account but it's only 349 satoshi:)

I will preface this by saying that I moved 99.9% of my BTC to cold storage years ago. Thank god. 

Also, please don't PM me. I won't respond. 

So this morning I got a string of rapid-fire emails confirming a ton of Coinbase withdrawals. I immediately flagged them and locked the account, but the damage was done. 

In the end, I lost a few thousand dollars worth of shitcoins that I bought in 2017. And a small amount of BTC that was sitting around for so long that it was actually worth a little bit today.

I am writing this mostly as another warning to those who keep substantial amounts of BTC on an exchange. GET IT OFF NOW!

 I am also writing this as a what-the-fuck-how-did-this-happen post. 

*  I have 2FA on my CB account. I use Google 2FA as an app on my iPhone. My phone has been in my possession full time. 
* Even my email uses 2FA for all log ins. 
* Everytime I log in to CB, I use Google 2FA. 
* Every time I log in to CB, I also get anoying texts emails emails saying ""new log in was this really you""
   * None of that happened this morning when someone else logged in to my account. 
* No, I didn't receive calls or texts from someone claiming to be ""customer service"".
* I was not tricked into using my credentials on a fake website. I hardly ever log in to anything BTC related site these days. I bought long ago and just HODL now. 
* I do not log in on multiple or foreign devices. 

I am curious to hear if something similar has happened to anyone? And if so, did you figure out how they accessed your safety parameters?

Where did I go wrong?

Reddit,bitcoin,Using 2 of 2 multisig to avoid risk of supply chain tampering,2025-01-02 10:05:27,"I am living in a country in which it is incredibly difficult to get hold of a hardware wallet, as most things are opened on arrival at customs and there's often no way of telling for sure if they have been tampered with. I am probably being paranoid here, but it's for my own peace of mind. I'm sure everyone has heard stories of people who have bought from Amazon and eBay...

I know the general consensus with most people is that 2 of 3 is the best way to go with multisig setup, but living abroad as an expat, that isn't really feasible in my case as it usually involves multiple addresses. Instead, I was thinking of going with 2 of 2 multisig, one 12 word key generated by the hardware wallet, and an additional 12 word key generated by the software wallet (sparrow or bluewallet), so 24 words in total when combined.

My thinking is that the key from the hardware wallet will be generated offline, and will not be accessible to hackers even if the software wallet is compromised, whilst the key from the software wallet would prevent any of the risks coming from supply chain tampering, as potential hackers will not be able to get both (Please correct me if I'm wrong here!). 

I've heard of exploits where hardware wallets send keys to the hacker once generated, but in order for a hardware wallet to be able to send both the key it generates itself, and the key from the software wallet, it would need to be able to bypass both the iPhone OS security, and that of the software wallet. 

This should be pretty bulletproof right? And it only involves looking after a 24 word seed phrase, the same as if I just created a 24 word phrase using the hardware device alone.",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Ethereum sell targets,2025-01-02 08:38:07,"For those who are holding ETH, what is your bull exit plan?

Initially, my target was for 170,000$ BTC and with a 0.07 ratio about $12,000 ETH.

Recently, performance of ETH has been disappointing relative to bitcoin.

Historically it gains against btc during the Q1 post halving year, but historically it also performs much better on a halving year than it has this year, and historically it performs  much worse in a bear market than it did last bear market!

So there’s not really anything reliable to go off as the market is still evolving, and the Q1 pump on ETHBTC could very likely not come to fruition.

Based on this, I’ve set a ‘safe’ target of around 7k (0.04 ETHBTC with 170k BTC) with a bullish target of ~10k (~0.06 ETHBTC).

Obviously, I am fairly confident btc gets a 70% pump from here which will affect everything.

",2025-01-01 19:56:02,"If you ever post about any issue you're having with a coin or wallet, the roaches come out of the dark and message you, sometimes claiming to be the developers, and offering to ""help"" by sending you a link to a website where they want you to connect your wallet.  This is almost always done privately, and oddly they like do it in the old reddit. 

The accounts they use are hacked accounts.  I report them using the Spam category. You can further select ""user is linking to malicious websites"".   However, Reddit doesn't seem to really act on this since the accounts remain active days afterwards. 

# So here's what you can do to take down these bastards:

* **Play into their scam.** Pretend you're an oblivious and ignorant victim that needs their help.  The goal here is to get them to send their scammy website URL to you.  This is not only proof for Reddit that they're a scammer but its important for the next step.

* **Identify their hosting server.** Without clicking on the link (it may have malicious code so don't click on it) copy the link and paste it into the URL portion of [VirusTotal.com](http://VirusTotal.com) This website will use multiple internet security scanning providers to scan the website for malicious code / bad behaviour and give you a report.  Click on the **Details** tab and look for ***server***.

[If you click on links inside of Virus Total, it stays in Virus Total. The links are often for further scans of that address or item.  So you don't have to worry about them directly linking you to a dangerous website. ](https://preview.redd.it/2asgbiv8ofae1.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=0287dad7d5f82cec3af7ddc39f795644dd2f9fc8)

* **Report the scammy site to the server provider.**  Go to the server providers website and look for their abuse contact and give them the address and why youre reporting it.  They will investigate it and take it down.   Sometimes you get providers like Vercel that will block your email address after you make a report making it nearly impossible to report outside of their little community bubble. Shameful.  Its up to you where you want to go from there.

I know it shouldn't have to be said,  but don't give out your secret recovery phrase to anyone.. ever.   Do not give out your private keys.  Don't connect your wallet to a site that you don't know. Don't click on links that users send you in private messages.  DYOR",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"why ""HODLING"" is a psyop: Why Centralized Exchanges and Passive Holding are Slowing Adoption",2025-01-02 22:55:13,"Cryptocurrencies were created to revolutionize finance by enabling decentralization and individual control over assets, without needing banks or intermediaries. However, two common behaviors—relying on centralized exchanges and the culture of ""hodling""—are undermining this vision and stunting crypto adoption.    

**Centralized Exchanges: A Step Backward**   
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were designed to give people control over their own money, but most users store their coins on centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. This means they don’t control their private keys, and their assets are essentially in the hands of a third party—just like a bank. While convenient, this goes against the very principle of decentralization.   

Exchanges also create security risks. High-profile hacks and the collapse of exchanges like FTX have shown that storing crypto on these platforms can lead to loss of funds. These incidents damage public trust in cryptocurrency, making people hesitant to enter the space.    

**The ""Hodling"" Culture**   
Hodling—holding onto cryptocurrency in hopes of future gains—has become a widespread practice. While it might seem like a good investment strategy, it stops people from using cryptocurrency as a currency. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were meant to be spent, transacted, and used to build decentralized economies. By treating crypto solely as an investment, users aren’t participating in the ecosystem, which slows adoption.   

This behavior is also beneficial to traditional banks, which stand to lose if cryptocurrencies are widely adopted. Real crypto adoption—where people use coins for transactions instead of just holding them—threatens the banking industry’s control over the financial system. As long as most crypto remains locked up on exchanges or in wallets, it poses little threat to traditional banking models.   

**The Risks of Forgetting**   
Storing cryptocurrency in a self-custodial wallet gives users full control over their funds, but it also comes with risks.

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem—the networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future—a mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces—developers, ideas, innovations—that break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the “canopy” near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree’s full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk’s purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree’s eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.





---

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree’s leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest’s conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree’s bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed—only the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you’ve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem’s Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem—assets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn’t compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds—set clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they’re too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they’ve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other’s innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree—tending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments—projects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix—with good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects—perhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn’t a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project’s stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin’s status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""—they are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It’s still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let’s explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree’s branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree’s weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree’s health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here’s how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI’s computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree’s Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.

It's unbelievable how some projects wrap around simplistic AI chat bots.

Virtuals reached top 50 MK because:

\-Created a crypto with 1B tokens all in ""circulation""

\- Insiders & VCs prob hold 90% of the tokens and haven't sold

\- 10% is retail pumping & pretending the bots are really good

Honest question, if your crypto project has all the tokens in circulation what is it's purpose besides retail buying and making the founders richer?

It's like a Buy order completed, and a sell order completed in the same exact second.

When I try to do a trade it, there is a delay as it waits for the order to go through can take upwards of 5-15 seconds... It seems like they are doing this automated somehow... Sometimes they will do a buy & sell, and then like 5 seconds later they will do another buy and another sell. 

Just wondering if this is hotkeys? Is it just multiple tabs open or something or is it software programs automating it?

After 7 games and a 3.5, 3.5 tie, Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi went to Fide and requested to share the Blitz Chess Championship title, something that wasn't allowed in the rules and had never been done before.

FIDE agreed and now Polymarket betters are again claiming they were scammed, as Polymarket has determined the winner of the tournament to be neither Magnus Carlsen or Ian Nepomniachtchi but instead to give the win to ""Other""

\---------

# So What Happened?

Polymarket the prediction betting site on Polygon hosted a Market for who would win the World Blitz Chess   Championship and because the rules state there can only be one winner, Polymarket didn't think it was necessary to make a betting option for ""Multiple Winners"". This in hindsight has caused further scam accusations directed towards the platform as anyone who voted that Magnus or Ian would win has lost all of their money.

**Now logically one would think that if that two people win, this can be solved by giving both Ian and Magnus yes voters a 100% payout** as they both technically won and the only people losing money would be the people who thought they wouldn't win. However Polymarket is literally incapable of having more than one winner in a market. **If Magnus is marked as the winner Ian will be marked as the loser and if Ian is then marked as the winner - Magnus will be changed to the loser.**

>It is vital that markets prepared on the NegRiskAdapter never result in a tie or will be unable to be determined. For any given market, once one question is resolved as Yes/True, all other questions must be resolved as No/False. This means that if the chosen oracle returns a second question as Yes/True, the call to `reportOutcome` will revert, and the market may not be able to fully resolved. Similarly, it is expected that one question will resolve to Yes/True, and it should not be the case that all questions for a given market resolve to No/False. Keep this in mind when preparing markets and questions on the NegRiskAdapter. [source](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter)

So because Polymarket must have only one winner Polymarket has opted to make the ""other"" option the defacto winner of the World Blitz Chess Championship.

Now this will technically go to UMA to vote if ""Magnus should win"" (Ian has already been marked as a loser) or ""other should win"" but because UMA ""the decentralized Truth Machine"" is decided by two whales  [(seriously)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g06kgs/polymarket_bettors_are_heading_to_trustpilot_to/) who vote as Polymarket tells them, this will resolve as Other, and anyone who voted that either Magnus Carlsen would win or Ian Nepomniachtchi would win, will lose all of their money... even though they both technically won.

EDIT: Other was meant for ""someone not mentioned"" this dropped to .01% because everyone not mentioned had been knocked out by the end of day 1.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Some golden rules for new investors,2025-01-01 11:58:40,"Happy New Year everyone. As a new year begins and new investors enter the crypto market this year like last year, I would like to share a few golden rules with you so that you don't get scammed and lose all your money:

1. Not you keys not your coins. In other words, if you want to invest a lot of money, buy a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor. Because as long as the coins/tokens (I'll just write coins for the sake of simplicity) are on the broker or exchange, you can lose them if they f\*ck up or the exchange goes bust (see FTX).
   1. If you have a hardware wallet (Cold Wallet) or a wallet created with an app such as Trust Wallet (Hot Wallet), never, absolutely NEVER share your 12 to 24 word phrase with anyone. This is the key to your wallet in the event of loss of login details. Also, do not take screenshots or photos of it that you then save on technical devices of any kind. It has often happened that people have revealed their phrase and had their wallets emptied as a result. Also do an antivirus scan on your devices to remove malware searching for any detail about crypto on your device
   2. Never buy hardware wallets from third-party providers, but only from the manufacturer itself. This is because third-party providers can provide you with hacked devices or devices with a phrase already attached and fake instructions, with which scammers can empty your wallet
2. Always DYOR (do your own research). Dont buy any coins trusting some crappy Youtubers. Many of them either don't know what they are saying or are paid by influencers or developers to advertise for their scamcoin. Also dont participate in anything you dont understund (Trading, Liquidity Pools, Lending, Staking or Leverage). Also be aware of Initial Coin Offers (ICO's). 99% of them are fake and/or scam. 
3. On social media, no one is your friend who wants to give you a hot tip or offer their help with problems. There are a lot of scammers lurking on all platforms. You will often receive DMs after almost every post about cryptocurrencies. Many will approach you in a very subtle and friendly way to suggest that they are not scammers. But they all are. Don't accept their DM request and be aware.
4. Only invest as much money as you can bear to lose. Don't invest money that you need. Diversify your portfolio. Dont invest all of your money into only one coin. 
5. Dont let emotions take control of you. Don't fall for hypes, don't do FOMO (fear of missing out) or lose your nerves if something goes down. The crypto market is very volatile and you have to be able to live with the fact that your portfolio can be down 30% from one day to the next, but you must also not fall into euphoria as soon as your portfolio is up 50%. Try to turn off your greed. As soon as you see something like this, realize profits (unless we are at the beginning of the bull market). Another indicator for selling is when even any crappy page or magazine suddenly starts talking about crypto. It's a bit of a meme, but it has proven to be true more than once. Sometimes its very hard to sell a coin to take profit. Because you sometimes build up an emotional hold on a coin. Just take the profit and never look back at what happened or what could be happen.
6. Do not buy any coins on decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Uniswap, Raydium, Pancakeswap etc. until you have gained enough experience in the crypto sector in general. There are a lot of scams lurking there that can either empty your wallet because you give them the authorization to do so or fall for a honeypot where you only serve as a provider of liquidity but can no longer sell anything so that the scammer can cash out. 
   1. If you have some experience, then always check the contract adress which you can find on [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) or [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), before buying a coin. Also check if a coin is a scam on pages like [Token Sniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/). You should also know which DEX runs on which chain. Its a bit more complicated but for example Uniswap runs on the Ethereum Chain. Therefore you won't be able to find coins which run on the Solana chain like PENGU. If you search for PENGU you will get some coins who are named the same but are either different ones or just scams. Always work with the contract adress. And if you are not sure, do research about it at first

So those were my tips for you. If I have forgotten something, please feel free to add it. I wish everyone a healthy new year and lots of profits. Take care",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,A mnemonic system to (almost) effortlessly memorize 128-bit of entropy,2024-12-28 12:47:51,"Hi,

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-03 00:53:00.605404

Reddit,crypto,Going from KEM to Signatures,2024-10-13 12:46:29,"Is there a known efficient way to generically convert a secure KEM into a signature scheme? I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme.  
I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.
