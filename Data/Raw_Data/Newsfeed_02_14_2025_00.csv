Analyst Identifies Key Price Level,2025-02-14 00:30:37+00:00,"In his latest technical breakdown posted on X, analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlighted a pivotal threshold on Dogecoin’s daily chart. According to Kevin, reclaiming the $0.28 region on a weekly close—and then showing clear follow-through—could set Dogecoin on a path toward retesting its all-time highs. He notes: “Get back above the .28 cents level on Dogecoin on a weekly close and show follow through and my thought process is we attack the highs not too long after that. I have been allocating into a spot long at .25 cents on DOGE in the Patreon via the Trading Portfolio (separate from long term bag). Ready for either outcome. Let’s send this thing higher.” When Will The Dogecoin Correction End? The chart highlights a well-known metric called the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band, applied here to Dogecoin, which consists of the 20-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Although this indicator was originally developed for Bitcoin, many analysts extend it to altcoins to determine whether the broader trend is bullish or bearish. In Dogecoin’s current setup, this band hovers in the $0.282–$0.286 range. Price dipped below it last week and now facing a key resistance zone between $0.27 and $0.29. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready For A $2.43 Rally? Elliott Wave Says Yes Beyond the price levels, Kevin also points to two momentum studies. On the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), the yellow line has crossed above its accompanying moving average, suggesting that bearish pressure may be easing. The RSI hovers near 38, which is above a notable support region around 27. Notably, the yellow RSI line is now back above its pink moving average (MA) line. According to Kevin, this may be an early sign of a shift in sentiment if follow-through buying continues. Another important technical feature is the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), which is nearing a bullish crossover. The MACD line is approaching the signal line, and if this crossover is confirmed, it could generate positive momentum for Dogecoin. Kevin marks this as a “Pending Daily Bullish MACD Cross,” which, if validated, would add further credence to the bullish outlook. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holding Strong—Analyst Says $4 Rally Could Be Next In the larger scheme, the chart underscores that a firm weekly close above $0.28 is the key catalyst. This level aligns with the Bull Market Support Band, and if reclaimed decisively, could accelerate Dogecoin’s push toward mid-$0.30s or beyond, provided broader market conditions remain conducive. In another post, Kevin explained: “I have been saying it for weeks now while the rest have said its altseason. We are in a major correctional period. These periods happen in markets in case you never noticed. Crypto is very driven off the macro, especially altcoins. We want to hold these levels on Total Market Cap if we want to feel good about this market otherwise the correction can go deeper. In the mean time Chill out. Still billions in liquidity up to $111K on BTC that will be taken eventually.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

This sharp decline has left investors on edge, fueling fear and uncertainty as Avalanche mirrors the bearish trends seen across the broader crypto market. Doubts about AVAX’s potential to recover and generate significant gains have started to dominate market sentiment, leaving many questioning whether a rebound is possible in the near term. Related Reading: Cardano Could Move Up To $0.83 If Momentum Holds – Can ADA Sustain A Breakout? However, amidst this uncertainty, there are signs that Avalanche may be preparing for a turnaround. According to key metrics shared by top analyst Ali Martinez, Avalanche is showing promising signs of a potential rebound. Martinez highlights that a key technical indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart, offering a glimmer of hope for a recovery rally. This signal suggests that AVAX might be nearing a bottom, and if market conditions align, it could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase. As the market remains volatile, all eyes are on Avalanche to see if this buy signal can translate into sustained upward momentum. Investors are cautiously optimistic, hoping that AVAX can overcome current challenges and reclaim its bullish potential. Avalanche Indicator Signals A Potential Trend Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) has been stuck in a state of indecision as bulls fail to reclaim the $27 mark, while bears struggle to push the price further down. This tug-of-war reflects the broader uncertainty in the crypto market, leaving Avalanche at a critical juncture. Analysts are divided on the next move for AVAX, with some predicting a massive recovery rally while others anticipate a continuation of the bearish trend that has gripped the market since mid-December. Top analyst Ali Martinez has added to the discussion by sharing a technical analysis on X that reveals promising signs for Avalanche. Martinez highlights that the TD Sequential indicator, a widely used tool for identifying trend exhaustion and potential price reversals, has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart. This is significant, as weekly signals carry more weight and often suggest the possibility of long-term reversals. If bulls capitalize on this signal and push the price above the $27 resistance level, it could trigger a broader recovery phase. On the flip side, failure to hold current levels may lead to further consolidation or downside movement as bears attempt to regain control. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Have Bought Over 600,000 ETH In The Past Week – Time For A Price Upswing? The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Avalanche, as the price action will either validate the bullish signal or reinforce the prevailing bearish sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring the $27 level and the implications of the TD Sequential signal, as it could mark the beginning of a long-awaited recovery rally for AVAX. AVAX Price Consolidates Between Key Levels Avalanche (AVAX) is trading at $25.6 after several days of indecision and consolidation within a narrow range, stuck below the $27 resistance level and above the $23 support zone. This tight range reflects the ongoing uncertainty in the broader market as bulls and bears battle for control. Bulls face a crucial test at current levels. They need to hold the $25 support zone and build momentum to push AVAX above the key $28.7 resistance level. Breaking and reclaiming this mark as support would confirm a trend reversal, signaling the start of a potential recovery rally. A successful breakout above $28.7 could attract more buyers and lead to a move into higher price levels. However, selling pressure remains a significant risk for AVAX. If the price loses the $23 support level, the bearish trend that has dominated since mid-December could continue. A breakdown below this range would likely take AVAX into lower demand zones, with $20 being the next critical support level.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Flag Pole Pattern Puts Price At $120,000, Analyst Explains The Roadmap",2025-02-13 21:30:08+00:00,"The crypto market has been experiencing significant volatility, with the Bitcoin price leading the charge. Over the past month, BTC has been trading sideways, recording declines that have pushed its value below the $100,000 mark. As analysts speculate about the cryptocurrency’s next major move, recent data suggests that a classic Flag Pole pattern is beginning to emerge on the Bitcoin price chart. The crypto analyst who has identified this pattern has shared a bullish roadmap prediction for Bitcoin, projecting that it could rise to a new all-time high above $120,000. In a TradingView analysis, crypto expert Weslad expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s future trajectory, projecting that it could soar as high as $120,843 in this bull cycle. The analyst highlighted the current formation of a classic Flag Pole pattern on the BTC price chart. The emergence of this distinct technical pattern in the Bitcoin structure has sparked an enthusiastic response from analysts, as they anticipate a massive breakout to the upside.  Roadmap To $120,000 Bitcoin Price Target According to the TradingView analyst’s chart, the Bitcoin price faced a rejection at an external supply area after experiencing an impressive 27% rally from a strong external demand zone between $$85,300 and $86,800. This rejection was a critical moment for the cryptocurrency, as it sparked the creation of what many experts call a perfect Bull Flag formation.  Related Reading: Bitcoin $166,000 Target Still In Play? The Extension That Determines Where Price Goes Next This bull flag pattern is typically known as a bullish continuation signal during an uptrend. It represents a halt in a cryptocurrency’s upward movement before the trend resumes. In the case of Bitcoin, Weslad suggests that its recent rejection is not viewed as a downturn but rather as a smart money accumulation zone designed to shake out weaker hands who panic during market declines.  Despite its pullback, Bitcoin’s recent price action has demonstrated a strong resilience in an immediate demand zone between $91,000 and $95,000. The analyst also describes this correction as a “fake down,” noting that it was due to liquidity engineering. This strategic liquidity grab allows large players to accumulate BTC at favourable prices before the next significant move upward. While noting the Flag Pole formation, Weslad also highlights a recent breakout from a Descending Channel that has previously restricted Bitcoin’s price movements. This channel breakout signals the possible resurgence of Bitcoin’s bullishness, with the analyst predicting an initial surge to $108,089.  If Bitcoin can maintain a positive momentum, the pathway to an ultimate Flag Pole target of $120,843 becomes plausible. Monitoring Breakout Signals While Weslad projects a new all-time high for Bitcoin at $120,843, the analyst also emphasizes important signals that could indicate an imminent breakout. He revealed that if Bitcoin can successfully flip the aforementioned external supply zone between $108,000 and $109,000, the cryptocurrency could see its price skyrocket to new highs.

According to recent data, wallets holding over a million ADA have been rapidly growing since November 2023, amassing an additional 1.41 billion ADA tokens.

Long-term ADA holders have raised their positions by 1.81%, exhibiting a wise investment strategy. The most notable change comes from the mid-term investors, sometimes known as “cruisers,” who have raised their holdings by a decent 7.65%. This increase points to a maturing market in which investors are choosing steady expansion above short gains. Short-term traders, meantime, have clearly turned away from speculative trading by cutting their exposure by 11.75%.

Even though ADA hasn’t gotten back to its all-time high of $1.32 in December 2024, many experts are still optimistic about its future. An esteemed member of the cryptocurrency community, Yoel Jr., stresses the importance of the $0.81 level as a stopping point for confirming positive progress. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales On The Move—224,000+ ETH Withdrawn In Record Outflow Price Targets And Entry Opportunities Ahead Based on Jonathan Carter’s study of the daily chart, ADA may be getting ready for its next significant action with a promising bull flag formation.

The road ahead consists of three important pricing targets: $0.845, $1, and $1.325. These tiers mark potential pause points in what might be Cardano’s path to unprecedented success. Although the crypto market is always erratic, the combination of whale accumulation, strong holder faith, and good technical setups points to Cardano positioning itself for a big market movement in the next months.

The announcement sparked the launch of multiple tokens inspired by the pet and was further fueled by BNB Chain’s memecoin launchpad’s name-guessing contest. Related Reading: BNB Flips Solana’s Market Cap Amid Market Retrace – Breakout To $700 Coming? CZ Sparks Memecoin Frenzy On Wednesday, Changpeng Zhao acknowledged the cycle’s memecoin frenzy after an X user asked if he had a dog. The Binance founder revealed he had “not a Shiba Inu, but a Belgian Malinois,” which resulted in the crypto community asking for the name and picture of his dog. CZ inquired about how it would work if he shared the information, asking if people would create memecoins based on the dog, how investors would know which one is the “official” token, and if it even mattered. He joked he would mull whether to “respect his privacy, or dox the dog for the cause,” sparking massive speculation about an official memecoin launch. On Thursday, CZ shared on X that he would officially share his dog’s picture and name at 8:00 PM Dubai time, or 4:00 PM UTC, sending investors into a frenzy over the upcoming post. Community members launched several tokens with the possible names of CZ’s four-legged companion, some reaching up to $60 million in market capitalization. Arkham noted that the two frontrunner tokens on the BNB chain, BROWNIE, and PERRY, significantly surged on Thursday morning. Remarkably, an investor made over $1 million with less than a $12,000 initial in 12 hours. Four.Meme Kicks-Off Token Event BNB Chain’s token launchpad, Four.Meme joined the frenzy, announcing a “CZ Dog Name Meme Token Betting Event.” According to the X post, the tokens with the same then-unknown name of CZ’s dog would be part of a competition. The tokens created today before 4:00 PM UTC would be eligible to participate and “become the next big meme.” The announcement detailed: 30 minutes after CZ’s post, the highest market cap token on Four.Meme wins! The winner’s token will have its tokens in LP revenue regularly burned by Four.Meme! At 4:12 UTC, the Binance founder shared a picture with his dog, Broccoli. The dog was named after the vegetable because he wanted “a name that started with B and has some green in it.” CZ wrote that he and Broccoli bonded over their difficulty socializing, adding that the dog helped him get a “good break” from the “intense negotiations with the DOJ back then.” He also stated that he never imagined his pet would be part of the blockchain ecosystem, adding that there’s “never a dull day in crypto.” Broccoli Immortalized In The Blockchain CZ clarified that he was “just posting” his dog’s pictures and name and not issuing a memecoin himself. He considered it was up to the community whether to launch a token. The BNB foundation “may provide rewards for the top memes on the BNB Chain, giving LP support or other rewards,” but the details are still being discussed. After the “Pet reveal,” the tokens guessing Broccoli’s name plummeted, with the leading memecoin falling from a $22 million market cap to less than $1 million in less than a minute.

The broader crypto market is finding strong demand at current levels, and investors are cautiously optimistic about a quick recovery rally into multi-year highs. Despite the bearish sentiment that has gripped the market recently, many believe that Cardano could lead the charge in reversing the downtrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Have Bought Over 600,000 ETH In The Past Week – Time For A Price Upswing? Top analyst Ali Martinez has shared a compelling technical analysis, revealing that Cardano appears to be following a similar pattern to its 2020-2021 price action. Martinez highlights that while the pace is slower this time, the structure mirrors the one that preceded Cardano’s explosive rally during the previous cycle. This historical pattern saw ADA surge significantly, and the current setup suggests that the cryptocurrency might be gearing up for a similar bullish breakout. Cardano sits at a critical juncture as the market awaits confirmation of this potential trend. Investors are closely watching key levels, hoping that the technical signals and historical comparisons hold true. If Cardano repeats its past performance, it could lead to a substantial recovery, bringing optimism back to the market. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether history truly repeats itself for ADA. Cardano Shows Bullish Potential Cardano has faced massive volatility and uncertainty in recent weeks, with the price dropping over 20% in less than a week before recovering more than 25%. Currently, ADA is ranging below key supply levels around $0.82, reflecting the market’s indecision and the ongoing speculation about whether the next move will be a rally or a deeper correction. This consolidation phase has left investors anxious but hopeful for a breakout that could define Cardano’s short-term direction. A compelling technical analysis shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X has provided a glimmer of optimism for Cardano holders. Martinez points out that Cardano appears to be repeating the same price pattern observed during the 2020–2021 cycle.  While the current pace is slower, the structure mirrors the prelude to ADA’s massive parabolic rally during the previous bull market. If history repeats itself, this setup suggests that Cardano could soon break out of its current range and enter a sustained upward trend. The potential for such a rally hinges on Cardano reclaiming and holding key levels above $0.82 and gaining momentum in a broader market recovery. While the market remains speculative, the parallels with past cycles offer a positive outlook for ADA.  Related Reading: Litecoin Approaches Daily Range Peak – Can LTC Break Multi-Year Highs? Investors are closely monitoring these patterns, looking for confirmation that Cardano is ready to break through its consolidation phase and embark on a significant rally. If the historical pattern holds true, ADA could soon lead the market in a powerful move toward multi-year highs, providing much-needed optimism for both Cardano and the broader crypto ecosystem. ADA Testing A Crucial Resistance Level Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.78, consolidating below the critical $0.82 supply level. This price previously acted as strong support in December but now serves as resistance, keeping ADA below key levels. Bulls need to reclaim this level as support to signal strength and pave the way for a recovery rally. A successful breakout above $0.82 could set ADA on track to target the $0.90 mark, which aligns with the 200-day moving average, a crucial indicator of long-term market trends. Despite the potential for a breakout, ADA faces considerable risks as the market remains filled with uncertainty and volatility. If ADA loses the $0.75 mark, it could signal renewed selling pressure, sending the price into lower demand levels. Such a drop would delay any potential recovery and deepen bearish sentiment around Cardano.

For now, ADA’s price direction hinges on reclaiming the $0.82 level and sustaining momentum in the face of broader market challenges.

However, a crypto analyst on the TradingView platform has presented a compelling bearish case for XRP, warning that the asset is nearing the end of a crucial 12-year cycle, which could trigger a severe correction down to $0.1. XRP’s 12-Year Cycle Nears Completion. Major Correction Ahead? According to the analyst, XRP has almost completed a 12-year cycle, and the conclusion of this phase is going to be a very intense correction of the XRP price. While acknowledging that XRP could still reach a slightly higher high before the full decline begins, the analyst believes that the probability of significant further upside is low and warns that a continued correction might occur over the coming months. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Shake Off Crash, Target This Major Resistance On The Road To $3.85 The warning is centered around technical indicators and technical patterns, particularly a long-term triangle pattern. This long-term triangle pattern persisted for five years between XRP’s all-time high of $3.40 in 2018 up until 2024, before breaking out into a final fifth wave. This final fifth wave has allegedly peaked at $3.40 in January 2025, and the next move from here is an extended move downwards. The analysis also references the Bullish/Bearish Reversal Bar Indicator by Skyrexio, which confirmed the conclusion of the 12-year cycle. Now, the proposed target for the correction is set around $0.1, based on the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Contrasting Prediction As Majority Remain Bullish On The Altcoin’s Future At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.43, meaning that a correction to $0.1 would represent a 95% decline from its current level. Such a drop would not only erase nearly all of XRP’s gains since 2017 but would also mark one of the most devastating collapses in its history. Interestingly, this projected loss in XRP market cap would be even greater than the one witnessed during the years it was suppressed by the weight of the SEC lawsuit against its parent company Ripple.  Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Bullish Flag On Daily Time Frame That Could Drive Price 45% To $2.9 This bearish prediction contrasts the overwhelmingly bullish sentiment currently surrounding XRP. Many analysts and investors expect extended price growth in anticipation of institutional adoption and regulatory clarity under the new Trump administration. One analyst even recently predicted that the XRP price is about to make an all-time high run to $5. Another analyst, Javon Marks, noted that XRP is well on track to reach over $100 in the coming years. Featured image from Medium, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,BNB Uptrend Gears Up: 10% Jump Brings $724 Resistance Into Play,2025-02-13 15:30:12+00:00,"BNB is riding a strong bullish wave, surging over 10% as bullish momentum continues to build. This impressive rally has brought the price closer to the critical $724 resistance level, a key barrier that could dictate its next major move. Over the past few days, BNB has displayed strong buying pressure, signaling renewed investor confidence. The surge comes amid broader market optimism, with bulls aiming to capitalize on the move. However, the $724 mark has historically been a tough zone, where sellers have previously stepped in to trigger corrections.  With market sentiment shifting in favor of altcoins, BNB’s performance is being closely watched. Will it conquer $724, or will resistance prove too strong? The coming days will be crucial in determining BNB’s next chapter. Technical Analysis: Can BNB Break Through $724? BNB’s recent 10% surge has brought it closer to the critical and challenging $724 resistance level, and breaking through it would require substantial buying pressure. The cryptocurrency’s price is currently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that bullish momentum remains intact. This technical indicator is often used to gauge the overall market trend, and trading above it suggests that buyers are in control and the uptrend could continue. Related Reading: BNB Bounce From $500: A Temporary Recovery Or Start Of A Rally? A sustained position above the 100-day SMA typically acts as a strong support level, preventing deeper pullbacks and reinforcing market confidence. If buying pressure remains steady, the price may continue its upward trajectory to key resistance levels. However, the MACD indicator shows overbought conditions, signaling that the asset may be approaching a potential reversal or consolidation phase. When the MACD line moves significantly above the signal line and the histogram expands, it often suggests that upside pressure is losing steam, and a price correction could be on the horizon. An overbought MACD reading does not necessarily mean an immediate downturn, but it does indicate that buyers may be exhausted and that profit-taking may increase. If the indicator starts to show a bearish crossover—where the MACD line crosses below the signal line—it would confirm a weakening trend, leading to a price retracement toward key support levels. Market Outlook: What’s Next For The Price? The market outlook remains cautiously bullish, with technical indicators showing strong momentum. BNB is trading above key moving averages, reinforcing the uptrend, while trading volume remains high, signaling sustained investor interest. However, challenges remain, particularly with the MACD flashing overbought signals, causing the rally to lose steam. Related Reading: BNB Steadies Above Support: Will Bullish Momentum Return? Should BNB break and hold above $724, it might trigger a fresh wave of buying, pushing the price toward $795 and beyond. On the other hand, a rejection at this level is likely to spark a short-term pullback, with $680 and $605 acting as key support zones.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Dips Below $95K as January CPI Data Shows Increasing Inflation. Can $MEMEX 100x?,2025-02-13 14:44:28+00:00,"The January US CPI data is in, and it’s not what the market anticipated. Consumer prices surged by 0.5% in the first month of 2025, exceeding the expected 0.3% increase. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3%, slightly above the forecasted 2.9% and higher than December’s 2.9% reading. The unexpected uptick signals persistent inflationary pressures, which could influence market expectations and Fed policy decisions. Core CPI data also delivered a disappointing surprise. The index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.4% in January, exceeding the expected 0.3% increase. This marks a sharp uptick from December’s 0.2% gain, signaling that underlying inflationary pressures remain persistent. The crypto market reacted swiftly to the latest inflation data, with Bitcoin slipping below the $95,000 mark in response. Amid rising inflation and global uncertainty, Bitcoin has remained rangebound for the past two months. Since briefly surging past $108,000 during the post-election rally, the leading cryptocurrency has yet to confirm a clear breakout or breakdown. Despite this consolidation, many analysts see the current price range as a prime accumulation zone, suggesting that Bitcoin could be gearing up for its next bull run. Bitcoin May Reach $1.5M by 2030 Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, believes Bitcoin can breach the $1.5M mark by the end of 2030. Despite current turbulences, Wood believes Bitcoin is right on course for this landmark for a couple of reasons. Ever since the appointment of Trump as president, more and more institutional investors have been keen to add Bitcoin to their portfolios due to its favorable risk-reward scenario. More than 74 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. The total value, in fact, has increased 5x during the last year – from $11B in 2023 to $55B in 2024. ARK Invest has published a report with Bitcoin price targets under various scenarios. Under the base case assumption, BTC is expected to grow at a CAGR of 40% to hit a price of $710,000. Even in a bear case scenario, ARK Invest expected Bitcoin to reach $300,000 – more than 3x from current levels. However, the bull case scenario predicts Bitcoin reaching the $1.5M mark, growing at a CAGR of 58% for the next five years. Sure, Bitcoin has a long road ahead, with several optimistic price predictions backing its seemingly monumental growth. However, short-term turmoil like unfavorable CPI data can undoubtedly dent your portfolios. This is why we recommend taking refuge in the best crypto presales. Since these aren’t listed on exchanges yet, they remain unaffected by external conditions. With crypto set to make a strong comeback later, now’s a good time to invest in these upcoming meme coins. So, which of the best meme coins should you pick? Surely, one won’t be enough, as you need diversity in your portfolio. Enter Meme Index ($MEMEX). What Is Meme Index ($MEMEX)? Meme Index is a top trending crypto project that allows token holders to purchase a curated basket of meme coins as per their risk appetites. The crypto market is admittedly a difficult landscape to navigate, one that requires extensive research. However, not all investors are able to stay abreast with developments and end up in losses. This is where $MEMEX comes in handy. Instead of doing all the legwork, you can simply pick from four pre-designed baskets to invest in. There are four indexes you can choose from: Meme Titan Index: The Meme Titan Index tracks the top 8 meme coins with $1B+ market caps, including DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. These established tokens offer lower volatility, making the index ideal for risk-averse investors—but with reduced risk comes limited return potential. Meme Moonshot Index: The Rising Stars Index includes meme coins on the verge of entering the top 8, all listed on tier 1 exchanges and nearing a $1B market cap. This basket provides a balanced mix of risk and reward for investors. Meme Midcap Index: This index is perfect for investors eyeing sizable yields. It contains coins with a market cap between $50M and $250M. The coins here can be quite volatile with considerable downside risk. However, they can quickly reach the Moonshot or Titan levels too. Meme Frenzy Index: The Frenzy Index is made for real risk-takers who like to live on the wild side. It contains highly volatile tokens that can make you a millionaire within a matter of days. However, they’re very, very volatile and can result in considerable losses as well. Why Can $MEMEX 100x? Meme Index ($MEMEX) is hands down the most ideal pick for investors who are new to the crypto markets. Plus, with the number of newbies only increasing, $MEMEX could very well be among the hottest tokens. Instead of randomly investing in unknown meme coins, you can bank on $MEMEX, which gives you access to smartly curated baskets by experts. Plus, each coin in a basket is included (or excluded) based on votes from community members. This ensures you’re going in the direction of market sentiments and picking only the best cryptos to invest in. For more information, check out $MEMEX’s whitepaper and its X feed. The $MEMEX presale is currently live and has already raised over $3.6M. You can get 1 $MEMEX for just $0.0161637 if you get in right now, as the next price increase is just a couple of days away. You can also stake your purchased $MEMEX tokens to earn a very healthy 633% APY as staking rewards. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $MEMEX. However, none of the above is financial advice, and you should do your own research before investing your hard-earned money. The crypto market can be highly volatile, and it’s best you consult a professional financial advisor to be doubly sure.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin To $1.5 Million? Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood Says It’s Coming,2025-02-13 14:00:32+00:00,"ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood is steadfast on her estimate that Bitcoin may rise to $1.5 million by 2030, despite a bold projection that is causing a stir across the crypto space. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales On The Move—224,000+ ETH Withdrawn In Record Outflow Known for her lofty tech forecasts, the financial guru described this situation during Ark’s Big Ideas 2025 conference, where she revealed that the odds of reaching this astronomical figure have actually increased. The Path To A Million-Dollar Bitcoin Wood’s forecast goes beyond simply hauling figures out of thin air. Given Bitcoin’s current market value of $95,500, Ark’s prediction would be a startling 1,470% rise over the next five years. The company has sketched three possible routes: a middle-ground objective of $710,000, a conservative estimate of $300,000, and the headline-grabbing bull scenario of $1.5 million. These scenarios correspond to compound annual growth rates of 21%, 40%, and 58% respectively. Institutional Money Floods The Crypto Markets Research by Ark indicates that the terrain of bitcoin investment is changing significantly. Under the most hopeful scenario, their study shows institutional investors might commit up to 6.5% of their worldwide market portfolio to Bitcoin. Major financial companies are already seeing the flagship crypto as a portfolio diversifier, drawn by its special risk-return profile, hence this is not only theoretical thinking. The possibility of the digital asset to account for up to 60% of gold’s market capitalization lends still another degree of legitimacy to these bold forecasts. Cathie Wood: BTC could reach $600K by 2030, and even $1.5M in bull market ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to reach $600,000 in the firm’s base case scenario by 2030 and could even hit $1.5 million in a bull case,… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) December 31, 2024 Stablecoins Dominate Conventional Payment Titans Perhaps the most eye-opening revelation from Ark’s research concerns stablecoins, which have quietly revolutionized the payment landscape. In 2024, stablecoin transaction values reached a whopping $15.6 trillion, surpassing both Mastercard and Visa. Stablecoin volumes were, in comparison, 119% of Visa’s and double Mastercard’s transaction numbers. Although conventional payment systems currently manage more individual transactions, the sheer financial value passing through stablecoins reveals a fascinating picture of the direction of digital finance. Multiple Growth Catalysts Point North Wood’s positive forecast is not predicated on any one element. Instead, Ark sees a confluence of growth drivers, including the adoption of Bitcoin as a safe haven by emerging economies, the incorporation of the digital currency into treasury holdings by nations, the growing use of on-chain financial services by corporations to diversify their cash reserves, and more.

As cryptocurrencies become more popular as an option to digital gold, and as their share of institutional portfolios grows, it seems that the market may not be giving them enough credit for their long-term potential. With the digital revolution happening in traditional finance right now, Wood’s big goals might not be so out of reach after all.

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

[**Comets of Web3 Romanian Solana Developer Program**](https://cometsweb3.space/solana-c3?ref=blog.colosseum.org)  
This free, six-week hands-on training course for developers and students provides 36 hours of expert-led instruction (held in Romanian language) covering fundamentals like token creation, NFT minting, and building on-chain applications with Anchor.

Reddit,solana,Meme coins are dying part 2,2025-02-13 11:07:26,"My previous post got a lot of comments. 

I can definitely tell who’s traded crypto for a while and who is new. 

If you think meme coins are still at there best etc you are more then definitely new, the meme coin market is struggling if you like it or not 

Last year was the ‘bear market’ but November there was so many fucking runners and December wasn’t a bad month either as we entered January it was HOT, trump dropped a coin and that’s it we are done people pack up your bags and LEAVE.

This world is full of SHEEP, once the streamers all move over to the chicken crossing game where you gamble your money or where ever they go mass people will follow. 

The meme market is in a bubble right now full of scamming streamers, degens and no true community, once this goes POP we will have half the liquidity if not less in the market

YESTERDAY 147K traders liquidated AND $316M  pulled from the market JUST YESTERDAY. How many days where we are losing $316m will we have before people run out of money? And it all falls to the rug pullers hands

MEME COINS ARE DYING BECAUSE YOUR PRESIDENT DECIDED TO SHOW THE WORLD HOW EASY IT IS TO SCAM US. 

YOUR PRESIDENT MADE YOU HIS EXIT LIQUIDITY, IF THIS DOESNT MAKE YOU REALISE HOW BAD IT WAS FOR MEME COINS NOTHING WILL 

I do still HODL some coins and it’s sad to see them die, do t continue to be exit liquidity, move on from your losses and find something to trade which has utility ",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,solana,Just wanted to say... WAGMI,2025-02-13 19:08:40,"I have seen so many negative things posted here about meme coins. I totally understand. Believe me, I'm not the best trader ever. One thing that came to  mind is how long it took me to learn so many different things about memes. I guess what I have to say is more for the newer/less experienced traders, and these things have really helped me. I'm sure I'm going to catch hell, but here we go. 

  
1. Never trust a KOL. Sorry but they are in it to win and not make friends. They will use you to pump their ego and bags. I'd be willing to bet that very few are actually as successful as they want you to believe, using fake pnl photo's and such. 

2. Never ""full port"". It doesn't matter if its .1 1or 10 or whatever you got. Dca is your friend. 

  
3. DYOR. I personally  never ape new launches, at least not until they have retraced and some sense of community has began to form. I look for active tg/x community that is actively raiding and planning.  Learn how to look for red flags, ie. distribution, bundles, etc. Organic volume is best.

4. Don't FOMO. There's always a hot runner coming off pump that is sending hard. If you miss it, there will be another. Don't buy the top. Don't be someone's EL. If you get a chance to buy a dip, then great. If not, oh well. The risk is much higher than the reward. Buy the red and sell the green. 



5. Make your profit and move on. Unfortunately, the next, WIF, PEPE, or whatever comes few and far between. Profit is profit so take that and build. 

6. Never put your guard down. Let's say you found a coin with a good community, possibly has some legs, fits the meta, good lore, etc. There always seems to be someone in the ""CTO Team"", that has all this good news about things to come, which never do. Be constantly aware of the trends, news, listings, or anything else that could make or break your coin. 

7 This should be obvious, but I feel like so many people don't get it. Almost every single token follows the price action of bitcoin to an extent. Bitcoin pumps then Sol pumps then Memes pump. The same goes for the opposite. Try to be as informed as possible and be aware of global events or other things that affect the market.  

8. I'm sure I missed a lot, but I think this may be the most important thing I have to say. Crypto is a very psychological space. People play mind tricks, lie, and do whatever they can to take advantage of others in order to profit. No matter what, don't be so hard on yourself for taking an L or many L's.  There will always be another coin, there will always be another chance. If you're that guy in the tg begging for sol so you can feed your family, or the guy saying he's gonna rope because he lost it all, maybe you should seriously reevaluate your life and finances, take a step back, and if life allows come back when you're in a better place.  



I hope this long rambling helps someone, even if its only one person. Never give up. WAGMI",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114
Reddit,solana,Meme coins are dying out,2025-02-12 20:02:44,"I came away from meme coins after trump launched his. Doesn’t seem like they have gotten any better. 

Does anyone else feel the meme coin cycle is over? Due to the degenerates rugging EVERYTHING. I knew this cycle would suck after I saw people live streaming on tik tok about meme coins. 

Unfortunately I don’t think they are going to get any better and I think SOL is gonna take a huge hit from this because personally SOL just screams scam due to all the crappy coins… not calling SOL blockchain a scam but once you get into the meme coins you realise there isn’t any good left.

Reddit,solana,Our Journey of Building a Trading Bot for DEX on Solana,2025-02-13 23:41:33,"Back in January, I stumbled down a rabbit hole about developing a trading bot for DEX on Solana. What I thought would be a one-week project quickly transformed into a substantial endeavor. I teamed up with three other individuals, and we decided to go all in!

# Our Progress:

So far, our bot has achieved a maximum of +1 block advantage with a median of 2, although performance can vary based on local fees. We’re investing around 60 hours a week as we dive deeper. We don't have immediate plans for a commercial release since our architectural refactoring alone will take over a month to complete.

# Features We've Developed:

What began as a simple copy-trading bot with custom rules has morphed into a robust trading tool with a range of capabilities:

* **Multiple Communication Protocols**: RPC and gRPC depending on the specific function needed.
* **Sniper Mode**: (WIP)
* **Support dexes**: We’re working with both Pumpfun and Raydium AMM (CLMM WIP).
* **Unified Dashboard**: Our platform allows users to control multiple instances of the bot from a single dashboard. Control holdings and manual selling.
* **Wallet Management**: Streamlined management of wallets.

# Buy/Sell Configuration:

* **Custom Size/Percentage**: Users can configure either a specific size or percentage for trades.
* **Dynamic Priority Adjustments**: Easily adjust free priority, slippage, and implement limits on buying.
* **Token Blacklist**: Keep unwanted tokens off your trading list.

# Advanced Sell Rules:

* **Dynamic Price Ranges**: Sell rules are tied to entry price, only activating when price differences fall within designated ranges.
* **Conditional Rules**: Execute rules based on defined criteria.
* **Take Profit and Stop Loss**: Enhanced tools for risk management.
* **Target Wallet Selling**: Specify wallets for selling trades.
* **Time-based Trading**: Options for removing tokens without transactions.

# Fee Management:

We can send transactions using multiple providers, with Jito and Temporal adjusting their fees based on current market conditions.

# Conclusion:

The learning curve has been steep, but every hurdle has sparked new ideas and improvements.   
Would love to hear any feedback, suggestions, or similar experiences you’ve had working on your own projects.

Reddit,solana,Wallet drained- want to know what happened so it never happens again.,2025-02-13 19:54:46,"Wanted to trade on hyperliquid which asked me for Arbitrum USDC, and I happened to have SOL USDC on my Jupiter wallet which I needed to bridge- I barely ever bridged any crypto



What I did:



* Synchronized Jup mobile wallet with web app through Phantom login
* then wanted to bridge Solana USDC to an Arbitrum address but didn’t have the possibility through Jupiter (only the other way around)
* Took a break for work and in an hour’s time I got drained



Just want to know what happened to prevent that.



Don’t recall having ever clicked on a shady link, have always been careful of that.



The USDC had been sitting comfy in the account for a while so I doubt very much that the Jup wallet was compromised before.



Same for Phantom, had one BullX wallet connected to it with a bit of memecoin dust on it.



There are 2 possibilities that stand out:



1. I copied the seed phrase to google keep so it would be faster for me to type it out by copy pasting



I know, I’m a careless idiot for doing that anyways nevertheless but how the fuck would someone have access to my google keep? Would someone be spying on me or have access to my account, point blank?



1. Phantom wallet was compromised. Somebody had access to it but nothing had been moved from there because there was simply too little capital to be drained



How would these motherfuckers have access to my Phantom wallet then? Would it HAVE to be a link I’d clicked at one point?

Reddit,solana,Advice on copy trading bot/arbitrage bot,2025-02-13 23:16:07,"Hello everyone,

I've been trying for about 3 weeks to make my own copy trading bot. I want it to be faster than GMGN because GMGN not only takes 1% on every trade I make but also their latency is around 3-5 seconds after the wallet you are tracking buys, which in the crypto market is an eternity.

What I've been trying to do is use ChatGPT among other AI's to help me make a script. I have all the hardware set up, I have AWS as my private server, Quicknode and Jupiter API, and even trying to integrate websockets. The problem is, I've actually spent a few hundred hours trying to set this up and even though in the beginning ChatGPT makes it look like it will be a relatively easy setup (10-20 hours), there's hundreds of errors that you get and it's almost like a loop, the errors are never ending. And if it couldn't get worse, it's almost like after asking it 20-30 questions, it starts to get ""fatigued"", making even more silly mistakes and errors.

I can't seem to be able to make this with ChatGPT, does anyone have any idea how I could get this done otherwise? I've been on Fiverr and Upwork but everyone thinks it's very difficult, they're busy, language barrier etc.

I would greatly appreciate any tips on how I could get this done. Optimally my bot would have under 100ms latency. Thank you.

Note: post said I needed to include flairs not sure what that is I just put dev/tech.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

I feel like it would be really nice for a community to have a good quality project that is worth of hodling. Something different than today's gambling shit. 

No scam. No rug pulling. No insiders. No presalee. No bs. Real meme coin. Real moonshot. 

I already have a good idea in my mind. 

I wonder if yall would be interested. 

I'd also think about working with someone to make it fun real project and get some help. I'd have to see about that, but yeah... 

Just thinking out loud now. 

Tell me what you think

I'm currently staking my meager 6 Solana with JitoSOL. It's been a few months and JitoSOL has certainly been slowly raising the spread between itself and Solana. I missed out on selling when it was at $320 tho lol. 

Is there another method that could be considered safer? Or a method that will yield higher returns with comparable risks? I don't want to gamble it away, which is why I no longer trade in meme coins after I lost a few hundred bucks.

# 📃 Messari State of Solana Q4 2024 Report

Messari's State of Solana Q4 Report shows an ecosystem that’s ripe with opportunity for builders, developers, and founders.

One of the most striking numbers is the growth in Chain GDP. Total app revenue soared 213% QoQ from $268 million to $840 million, with November alone pulling in $367 million.

Applications on Solana are now generating more revenue than the network’s Real Economic Value (the total amount of transaction fees and MEV generated on the network).

Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi climbed by 64% to $8.6 billion, and average daily spot volumes jumped by 150%.

Infrastructure upgrades also take center stage as the rollout of Agave V2.0 nears completion, with over 90% of validators running the updated client.

The upcoming Firedancer and its variant Frankendancer, which is already live on testnet (and in a non-voting mode on mainnet), will also boost scalability and performance.

With the activation of Time Vote Credits and proposals to increase block limits (up to 50M CUs) and add slashable event verification, the network is improving transaction processing and overall throughput.

Meanwhile, gaming and social initiatives are gathering momentum with new hardware announcements like the Solana Mobile Seeker phone and gaming controllers, and a host of gaming projects moving to Solana.

The Q4 2024 report shows that Solana is not only scaling in terms of transaction throughput and network upgrades but is also becoming a more attractive platform for projects to build on.

Reddit,solana,How to buy meme coins in 2025 - a comprehensive guide for new buyers,2025-02-11 21:08:05,"When I first started buying and trading meme coins, I felt as though I was extremely overwhelmed by the amount of options available for wallets/trading/watching. It took me some time to sift through what I had at my fingertips, but I eventually found my groove. Going to try and summarize the major points I learned here to hopefully help those just learning now, especially with big coins like Dave Portnoys and Trumps hitting the market.

**Getting Started: Platforms and Trading Options**

1. **Set Up a Wallet**: Begin by funding a secure wallet compatible with your chosen blockchain.
2. **Identify the Coin**: Research and select the meme coin you're interested in. Ensure you have the correct contract address to avoid scams.
3. **Execute the Trade**: Utilize decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or platforms to swap your base cryptocurrency (like SOL) for the desired meme coin.
4. **Monitor and Manage**: Keep track of your investments and be prepared to act swiftly in the volatile meme coin market.

**Alternative Approach**

For those seeking a more streamlined experience without the complexities of traditional wallets and DEXs, there are many platforms that offer user-friendly interfaces. I find [Movement.Market](http://Movement.Market) to be the most user-friendly, but it's important to do your own research. They allow for quick transactions using familiar methods, making it easier to navigate the meme coin market.

**Investment Strategies**

* **High-Risk Ventures**: Investing in newly launched meme coins can yield significant returns but comes with heightened risk. Due diligence is crucial.
* **Community-Backed Tokens**: Focus on meme coins with active communities and transparent development teams. These often exhibit more stability and long-term potential.
* **Network Building**: Engage with influencers and developers within the meme coin space. Building relationships can provide insights into promising projects and early investment opportunities.

**Understanding Basic Graph Trends**

One of the most important skills when investing in meme coins (or any crypto) is learning how to read basic graph trends. While the meme coin market can be highly unpredictable, spotting patterns can help you make informed decisions. Here are a few key things to look out for:

1. **Support and Resistance Levels**
   * **Support**: The price level where a coin tends to stop falling and bounces back up.
   * **Resistance**: The price level where a coin struggles to break above.
   * Knowing these levels can help you decide when to buy or sell.
2. **Volume Spikes**
   * A sudden increase in trading volume often signals big moves in price—either up or down.
   * High volume with rising prices could mean strong interest in the coin, while high volume with falling prices may indicate heavy sell-offs.
3. **Upward and Downward Trends**
   * Look for consistent **higher highs** and **higher lows** to spot an upward trend (bullish).
   * Conversely, **lower highs** and **lower lows** indicate a downward trend (bearish).
4. **Breakouts**
   * A breakout occurs when a coin's price moves beyond a significant support or resistance level, often signaling a new trend.
5. **Beware of FOMO Traps**
   * Parabolic spikes (sharp, sudden price increases) are often followed by equally sharp drops. Recognizing unsustainable trends can save you from buying at the peak.

**BIG TIP**  
Ensure that your twitter account, or your burner twitter account is optimized to receive crypto themed tweets and suggested content. Ensure you interact and follow meme coin and gem accounts.

**Final Thoughts**

The meme coin market in 2025 is both thrilling and unpredictable. While the allure of substantial gains is ever-present, it's imperative to approach investments with caution, conduct thorough research, and stay informed about market trends. Remember, while the potential for profit is significant, so are the risks involved.

*I know a lot of this information may seem redundant, but there are a lot of new users coming into the sub seeking advice and answers on how to navigate the market. This is made in order to help push them in the right direction*",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,solana,Help Understanding Transaction (SolScan & Trojan),2025-02-12 18:33:12,"Hi Guys. I need help from the Community with Understading some Transactions Made.

I Recently Started Copy Trading, and I believe i Found a Really Good trader. The Only thing, is When My Trannsactions Go through, what it Shows as Being deposited, isn't the actuall Amountt hat was Deposited I'm Doing 0.1 SOL Per Trade here. 

(View Image Below)

[https://ibb.co/YnNjL6W](https://ibb.co/YnNjL6W) (Image 1)

[https://ibb.co/ksmyfcyr](https://ibb.co/ksmyfcyr) (image 2)

  
In Image 1, I Bought For 20 and sold for 77. But in Image 2 of the Actual SolScan Transaction, It Says received $68. BUT in my Actual Trojan Bot, My balance Went Down! I'm Completely Lost, and Confused. I have no idea whats going on 😵 Can you Help Me Understand Why?

Is it because I'm trading With Such Low Amounts? Do I need to Increase My Balance and my trading Size? Is it becuase my trades are to Slow, and I'm Selling at a Different amount than is shown? How do i make it Go faster? My Sell Gas is set to 0.002, And i have my ""Sell Priooty Fee Overide"" Set to the same 0.002. Do i need to Increase it To make the Sales go through Faster? What am i doing Wrong? 😭

I want to put more money in, but i need to Figure of what i'm doing wrong 1st before proceeding.

He is looking for something that will instantly auto buy any coin when a specific Twitter user tweets a solana CA. He want to be able to link a new wallet and instantly buy if someone tweets a CA.

Reddit,solana,Solana is More Than Just Trading — 5 Paths You’re Probably Ignoring,2025-02-11 13:23:32,"Most people see Solana as **just a place to trade memecoins and chase pumps.**   
  
But if all you do is **trade, you’re missing the bigger picture.**

The **real players in Solana** aren’t just flipping charts—they are **creating the future.**   
  
Let’s break down the **5 major paths**. 👇

https://preview.redd.it/zs9rm9tkfiie1.jpg?width=310&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96cfd35e4caf65ae0253474223308739e02d9a91

# Solana is NOT Just About Trading

If you think **the only way to make it in Solana is by trading, you’re playing a small game.**  


💡 **There are at least 5 different ways people carve out their spot in the ecosystem:**

1️⃣ **Trading** – Learning how markets move, sniping plays, and tracking trends. 📈  
2️⃣ **Marketing & Growth** – Helping projects **gain visibility** and directing attention. 🎯  
3️⃣ **Developing** – Building **smart contracts, bots, and infrastructure.** 🛠  
4️⃣ **Building & Innovating** – Creating **entire ecosystems, not just one-off projects.** 🏗  
5️⃣ **Influencing & Content Creation** – Shaping **narratives and leading communities.** 🗣

👉 **Now, let’s break them down.**

https://preview.redd.it/9mj3vqwrfiie1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=865bfd8e23f873714e37f21ef0577ad4218f4a47

# Trading – Playing the On-Chain Game

* Trading isn’t **just buying low and selling high**—it’s about understanding the market.
* The best traders **front-run narratives, track liquidity, and read on-chain signals.**
* **Instead of chasing hype, they study market cycles and exit before the herd.**

🚨 **If you’re trading based on Twitter calls, you’re already late.**

https://preview.redd.it/25p6wd8yfiie1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eef593da944b35a02e3aa4280a8089572ed08818

# Marketing & Growth – The Attention Game

* **Every successful project in Solana needs attention.** Without it, even great ideas die.
* Good marketing isn’t just **shilling**—it’s about **crafting narratives** and directing the right eyeballs to the right place.
* The best **Solana marketers** create **viral campaigns, manage KOL relationships, and sustain hype.**

🔥 **If you know how to build hype and direct attention, you can make anything move.**

https://preview.redd.it/ynuf9fv1giie1.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fbee0f6510c39c7cd9938de20e0ba6e42714246

# Developing – Building the Tools That Matter

* Everything in crypto runs on **code.** The **best traders, builders, and market makers** depend on devs.
* Smart contract engineers, bot developers, and tool creators **control the infrastructure.**
* **If you can build, you can dictate how the ecosystem evolves.**

🚀 **The biggest projects on Solana—Pump.fun, Tensor, Jupiter—came from devs who saw what was missing and built it.**

https://preview.redd.it/byanj0ibgiie1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99b5d74cd01ba01fab9d165788ed84eb36d839de

# Building & Innovating – Founders Who Change the Game

* Some of the **biggest winners in Solana aren’t just traders—they’re builders.**
* [**Pump.fun**](http://Pump.fun) **wasn’t just a tool—it shaped an entire market meta.**
* The best builders don’t **just launch tokens—they build ecosystems** that keep growing.

🔑 **If you launch something people need, you create your own economy.**

https://preview.redd.it/hyxtjkhigiie1.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=993f3eff861553c16b56ee6c3a60d7532ee1f2dd

# Influencing & Content Creation – Controlling the Narrative

* In crypto, **narratives move markets.**
* The biggest influencers don’t just **report trends—they start them.**
* Many top voices on Solana **began by sharing insights, breaking down patterns, and consistently posting value.**

📢 **If you control what people talk about, you control where liquidity flows.**

https://preview.redd.it/9i5jf78ngiie1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e1ea196f56934250dd9d73fab75fd3cf2cfb126

# Why This Matters

* If **all you do is trade, you’re playing a small game.**
* The biggest winners **create, not just consume.**
* **Traders react—builders, marketers, and devs shape the space.**

Reddit,ethereum,The Ungratefulness of Hating Vitalik Buterin,2025-02-13 13:02:18,"In the last few months Vitalik has frequently been target of abuse in crypto communities - in other subs and also across social media - especially from people who are upset about ETHs market performance

I think one of the most ungrateful things to do in this space is to hate Vitalik. Are people even aware that he imagined and created a brilliant blockchain platform that changed modern finance? At 19 years old - 19!!! When you were 19 what were you doing with your life? The creation of Ethereum was a technological revolution that built the basis for a new world - and it boosted the blockchains utility beyond its original intent

Even though the price isnt doing very good right now - Ethereum works as intended and has become safer with each upgrade. These haters ignore Ethereums immense impact and are either frustrated bag holders or butthurt maxis

Blockchain technology might not have progressed as far as it has without Vitaliks vision. Hating him fails to give the recognition he deserves for his contribution to the creation of Ethereum and consequently a large piece of the cryptocurrency sector. Plus the Ethereum Foundation has been working on changes. They pay attention to what the community has to say - people gotta learn to be patient instead of demanding action right away",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,ethereum,The Ephemery Testnet is now running the Pectra upgrade. You can play with MaxEB with no risk now!,2025-02-13 21:31:55,"The Ephemery testnet is a new-ish Ethereum testnet that resets every 28 days. You can find all relevant links to it here: https://ephemery.dev.

Today, in a regular 28-day restart cycle, we upgraded Ethereum to Pectra.

What does this mean? 

It means that if you operate a validator, or if you're thinking about it, you can now see how Max EB works in practice. You can [PoW mine](https://ephemery-faucet.pk910.de/) a thousand Ephemery Ether in a few minutes, and use that Ether to [launch validators](https://launchpad.ephemery.dev/en/) and use the 0x02 credential to stake up to 2048 Ether on one validator, and receive higher rewards for any whole number effective balance above 32. (In other words, you'll receive greater rewards if you stake 33, 34 Eth, etc.)

Ephemery is the PERFECT place to Fuck Around and Find Out how Pectra, Max EB, and 0x02 will affect validators.

The best part about all of this is you won't need to wait a long time for sync - because Ephemery resets every 28 days, there's no chain bloat to worry about. 

Cheers to Ephemery!",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,ethereum,ACDC #150: The Competitive Advantage of $ETH,2025-02-13 01:16:14,"In this week’s episode in Infinite Jungle, Christine Kim unpacks the latest Ethereum ACDC call #150. The conversation revolves around Ethereum’s competitive advantage and an important update on the upcoming Pectra mainnet activation. Here’s what you need to know:

**Pectra Activation Delayed**

Ethereum developers initially planned a faster rollout for the Pectra upgrade, but feedback from Layer-2 projects and staking providers led to a change of course. Concerns about the timeline being too aggressive resulted in a one-month delay, ensuring at least 30 days between the final public testnet upgrade and the mainnet launch. This extra time will allow for better preparation and smoother implementation.



**Ethereum’s Competitive Edge in a Crowded Blockchain Space**

Christine also explores why Ethereum continues to lead despite new challengers in the blockchain ecosystem. Key strengths include:

* Established Ecosystem – A massive developer community and deep-rooted integrations.
* Security & Decentralization – A proven track record with robust security mechanisms.
* Network Effects – The most widely used smart contract platform, with significant institutional adoption.

With Ethereum evolving and competition heating up, this episode offers valuable insights into the future of the ecosystem.

Reddit,ethereum,Staking ETH directly in Trust Wallet?,2025-02-13 09:02:30,"Hi everyone,

does anyone have experience with staking ETH directly on Trust Wallet? Is everything going smooth and would you say that the risks are less than staking on an exchange?
Are rewards being paid out regularly?

I‘m planning to stake a little amount and let it ride for a few years. Just want to be sure nothing bad is going to happen.

What concerns me, is the post of u/Embarrassed_Ad_8406 , who was not able to redeem any rewards after staking large amount of ETH. 

And one additional question: is there any information which validators are being used when staking directly in the Trust Wallet app? I want to be sure that they are all legit and my ETH doesn’t land in LIDO or RocketPool. If this is the case, then I can simply skip Trust Wallet and use these services myself.

Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Yield farming for beginners,2025-02-08 17:26:09,"Someone asked for yield farming recommendations yesterday in the daily and I thought I'd open a thread for it, because I'm sure more people are interested in that.

I'd love to hear experiences with and recommendations for:

* Protocols and projects
* Strategies for keeping track of deposits, moving funds where yield is good, avoiding tax headache
* Resources for learning

Protocols and projects I saw mentioned before:

* Aave
* Yearn
* Beefy
* Convex
* Pendle

Resources

* [The Rabbit Hole Explorer’s Guide](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/) by u/LogrisTheBard is a great read and contains the following list of places to start in DeFi:
   * Money markets such as Aave and Compound
   * Dexs such as Uniswap and Curve
   * Liquidity incentives/farming such as Convex and Aura
   * Leverage such as Gearbox, Defisaver, and GMX
   * Options such as Lyra and Hegic
   * Real world asset protocols such as Centrifuge and Maker
   * Regen finance such as Gitcoin Grants, Greenpill, and Klima

I'll add to the lists, based on recommendations in this thread.

Personally, I think I'd like to do something with USDC. I want to split a smallish amount into a couple of different protocols, some low risk low yield and also some a bit more experimental. I'm ready to loose some of my money, I mainly want to try stuff out. I'm in Germany and ideally this will not make my taxes a complete nightmare.

Crab markets are for yield farming so LFG!",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

In other words, I want to go through some service like Myetherwallet into my wallet and put my full name next to the address, as well as with the opportunity to show in the service itself a transaction originating in the past, and regarding it, so that the screen shows that the wallet belongs to me.

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?


Thx for your responses mates.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,I built a minimalist Bitcoin notebook to help orange pill the world,2025-02-13 16:56:53,"Hey Bitcoiners,

I wanted to share something I've been pouring my heart into – a minimalist, notebook-style website dedicated to helping people understand Bitcoin: 

[https://satoshinotebook.com](https://satoshinotebook.com)

The project started as my personal collection of thoughts and explanations about Bitcoin, originally meant for orange-pilling friends and family. As it grew, I realized it could be valuable for the broader community.

I am hoping to grow this project into a central resource for people to come in and learn about money and bitcoin. It's also completely open source. I believe in Bitcoin's ethos of collaboration and transparency. If you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements, the project is waiting for you on GitHub.

What makes it different:

\- Builds understanding from first principles

\- Beautiful, distraction-free design

\- Bite-sized nuggets of both philosophy and technical details

\- Progressive learning path from basics to advanced concepts

\- Minimalist aesthetic that lets the ideas shine

The site takes you on a journey through Bitcoin's fundamental concepts, gradually building up to more complex ideas. Whether you're just starting out or deeply involved in Bitcoin, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

I built this because I believe that understanding Bitcoin is crucial for our future, and everyone deserves access to clear, thoughtful explanations of why it matters.

Check it out and let me know what you think. I hope it helps you orange pill someone you care about! 

With love,

🧡

Reddit,bitcoin,How often put bitcoin in cold wallet,2025-02-13 13:09:25,"So I’m new to bitcoin and have about $500 worth of btc so far. I just started this month and I’m trying to do regular purchases of $50-$100 once a week. 

I just got my cold wallet delivered last night and I’m gonna set it up today. My question is, how often should I pull my btc off of the exchange and store it in the cold wallet? I understand to withdrawal the btc I’ll pay a small fee. Is this a percentage or a one time fee. Currently I’m using Coinbase but it is quite expensive so I may switch to strike or kracken once I do some more research. I guess I’m just asking regardless of what specific exchange is being used. 

Should I immediately pull my btc off of the exchange or wait until I have $1000 or so? What is the most efficient and safest way to do this. 

My goal is to continue investing to accumulate.1-.2 btc as my first goal so I won’t be selling/trading at all for a long while if ever.

I could sell my house and get say roughly 900k…I could then buy a unit outright for say 500-600k leaving roughly 300k in the pool … Mind you my house and land is in a great spot 300m from beach and I’ve set it up so good with sauna , gym, ice bath etc … Yet still the allure of being more wealthy glimmers away …

So back to it . If I went ahead with this plan I would have 300k to invest give or take . Say 100k in bitcoin and another 100k in managed shares paying dividends annually . In 5 years I may be able to buy back another house close to the beach with a few hundred grand in the bank …This idea is really stuck in my head right now …",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,bitcoin,"Had a question about BTC going up & down, and timing investments.",2025-02-14 00:34:57,"I was just wondering, what logically makes sense here, 

Historically BTC has gone down a lot after reaching ATHs many times, it hit 20k then came back to 4k, hit 40k then came back to 16k, not saying it is a pattern but it has happened before, So, if retail investors are putting in a significant amount of funds, like buying 0.1-10 BTC now or DCAing a few thousand each month during 2025, might suffer loses during crypto winter, or when the sentiment is extremely bearish in the next short time horizon (<4 years), and if they had invested their funds during that period, they'd had acquired a significantly larger amount of BTC, again no one knows where the price will go, up, or down, 

But if someone is in a position to invest large sums now when BTC is near its all-time high, should they just jump in and hold, regardless of it maybe being 60k in a year, Impossible to time the market, but I hope my question makes sense.  ",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114
Reddit,bitcoin,The future of Bitcoin - supply shock coming?,2025-02-12 21:45:38,"600,000 BTC left exchanges last year, reducing available supply by 22%. This could trigger a supply shock, leading to a price increase if demand remains steady or rises. Investors are likely HODLing, reducing selling pressure. Lower exchange liquidity may cause higher volatility. If market sentiment turns bullish, FOMO could push prices even higher. However, macroeconomic factors like regulations or interest rate hikes could offset this effect. Overall, the trend appears bullish for Bitcoin.

If the current BTC outflow of ~50,000 BTC per month continues, a supply shock could become evident by late 2025 or early 2026. At that point, exchange reserves would drop to around 1.58 million BTC, significantly reducing available liquidity. If the outflow accelerates or demand surges, the supply shock could occur earlier, potentially in 2025. This could lead to higher price volatility and upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/yFiFeq3.jpeg)",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,bitcoin,‏The Wild Ride That Even Rollercoaster,2025-02-13 21:40:39,"Hey r/Bitcoin, 

Ever feel like checking your Bitcoin portfolio is like peeking into a horror-comedy movie? One minute it’s climbing to the heavens like it’s auditioning for a superhero movie, and the next, it’s plunging faster than my hopes on a Monday morning. Lately, Bitcoin’s been throwing more plot twists than a daytime soap opera!

Just this week, after a tweet from that one mysterious crypto influencer (you know who you are), Bitcoin decided to moon—only to do a belly flop moments later. It’s almost as if Bitcoin is in a toxic relationship with stability: it loves the thrill of highs and the agony of lows, and we’re all just along for the ride.

The current events? Imagine if your favorite rollercoaster got a turbo boost and then suddenly the brakes failed. Regulators are poking around like that one friend who always ruins the party, while memes are flying faster than crypto rumors. And amidst all this chaos, we hodlers are here clutching our digital wallets like they’re the last slice of pizza.

So, buckle up, folks. Whether you’re laughing at the absurdity or crying into your coffee, remember: in the wild world of Bitcoin, unpredictability is the only constant. And hey, if nothing else, it gives us endless material for memes and a good laugh at our own expense.

HODL on tight and keep those memes coming!

TL;DR: Bitcoin’s been crazier than ever—part superhero, part tragic love story, and entirely meme-worthy.

Let the rollercoaster continue!

Reddit,bitcoin,Why using your Bitcoin as collateral for a loan is the worst idea ever,2025-02-12 11:50:31,"So there is a lot of talk in here and various other spaces online about, ""Never sell your Bitcoin, use it as collateral to get a loan out."" Reasoning behind it has been so you don't pay capital gains taxes and also get to retain your Bitcoin.

Currently live in Australia and have done research on this as an option and I have found it to be a very lacking and risky option.

We had companies like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi to name a few where a lot of people lost their Bitcoin that was posted as collateral and have not been reimbursed. For current lenders like Ledn, the collateral you have to post is double what you get back in a loan, plus you pay like a 15% interest rate on it and they rehypothecate your Bitcoin most likely and so there is massive risk of another Celsius/BlockFi collapse happening.

There are no traditional banks with insurance that offer loans with Bitcoin as collateral, in fact they do not care about Bitcoin. Also, even if they allowed it you would still have to give up custody of your keys to get the loan in the first place and are we really, as Bitcoiners going to entrust a third party with our BTC? Have we all lost the point of BTC?

Also you would not be able to service the interest repayments on the loan because having the collateral isn't good enough, you also need to have income (separate from selling Bitcoin to pay for the loan) in order to qualify for a loan in the first place. 

So I don't know how any true BTC maxis in here would recommend this as an option but every third comment I have seen is ""Never sell your Bitcoin, get loans out against it"" and as we can see that is a complete BS option.

I have not had one person comment who has actually gotten a loan out against their BTC, no one has done it, because it's a ridiculous idea.

Personally, I would rather take the 15 to 22% capital gains tax hit on selling some Bitcoin for spending, compared to giving the entire Bitcoin to some random company and getting a tiny loan back (which has to be paid back + interest) and then maybe if they don't collapse you'll get your Bitcoin back at the end of that. NO THANKS.

Let's have a discussion, am I right or wrong? Am I missing something? Are there good loan options out there?",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,bitcoin,Is Bitcoin becoming centralized in a different way?,2025-02-12 20:09:37,"Since MicroStrategy now owns around 2% of all Bitcoin, and other companies are likely to follow in the future, doesn’t this contradict Bitcoin’s original purpose as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency, even if it helps with price appreciation?

I also looked recently into mining, but with energy costs and competition rising, it’s already very hard for individuals to participate without spending more than they earn. At the same time, if corporations and institutions keep accumulating Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than using it, doesn’t that create a new form of centralization? Instead of a few entities controlling the monetary system like in traditional finance, we could end up with a few corporations controlling a significant share of Bitcoin.

Of course, some will argue that Bitcoin remains decentralized because of the blockchain itself, because no one can change the rules, seize funds, or censor transactions. But if a small number of companies control a large percentage of the supply, doesn’t that still give them disproportionate influence over the market and adoption?

Yeah, I’m personally invested in Bitcoin and see the benefits, but I’m curious how do you view this trend?

MEXC and Gate.io block MOON deposits, meaning you can only buy and withdraw—no arbitrage. This causes:

📈 Artificially high prices – No deposits mean no one can sell cheaper MOONs, leading to inflated prices.

⚠️ Fake volatility – Prices swing wildly due to restricted supply, making MOONs look riskier than they are.

📉 Messed up CoinMarketCap charts – Skewed prices make MOONs appear unstable, discouraging investors.

🚪 Liquidity risks – If prices crash, you might be stuck with MOONs you can’t sell fairly.

🔄 Better options? Buy MOONs on Kraken or Camelot for fair pricing and full market access. Don't let exchange policies ruin your trades and moons!

Let’s break it down.

#🌀 Phase 1: The Genesis Era (2009 - 2013)

📜 The Bitcoin Creation Myth

Bitcoin launches (2009): Satoshi Nakamoto drops the Bitcoin whitepaper, mining begins, and a few cypherpunks take notice.

The First Transactions (2010): 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. Bitcoin’s first real-world value is established.

Mt. Gox rises & falls (2011-2013): The first major exchange, the first major hacks, the first crypto boom and bust cycle.

Altcoins emerge (2011+): Litecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin—the first experiments in differentiating from Bitcoin.

🔹 Theme: ""Digital gold, magic internet money, early speculation.""

🕰 Where we were? Cypherpunks and libertarians playing with an experimental financial toy.

#⚡ Phase 2: The Smart Contract Revolution (2014 - 2017)

🧠 From Money to Programmable Finance

Ethereum launches (2015): Vitalik Buterin introduces smart contracts—now blockchain isn’t just money, it’s a decentralized computing platform.

ICO Mania (2016-2017): Ethereum fuels an explosion of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with millions raised in minutes (and scams rampant).

Bitcoin splits (2017): Blocksize wars → Bitcoin Cash hard fork → BTC’s ossification begins.

Ethereum’s ""World Computer"" vision gains traction, but scaling issues arise.

🔹 Theme: ""Programmable money, decentralized apps, the rise of Ethereum.""

🕰 Where we were? Wild West fundraising, the birth of altcoin culture, and the first big questions about Bitcoin's ability to adapt.

#🌊 Phase 3: The DeFi & NFT Explosion (2018 - 2021)

🎢 Crypto Goes Full Casino

DeFi Summer (2020): Decentralized finance (DEXs, lending, yield farming) explodes on Ethereum—billions locked in smart contracts.

NFT Mania (2021): JPEGs selling for millions, celebrities launching NFT projects, mainstream brands entering crypto.

Ethereum congestion crisis: Gas fees skyrocket → Layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon) rise to fix scaling.

Bitcoin stagnation vs. Ethereum innovation: The debate intensifies—BTC maximalism vs. the rise of multi-chain ecosystems (Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, etc.).

🔹 Theme: ""Decentralized casinos, JPEG speculation, and the first real DeFi boom.""

🕰 Where we were? Crypto was both a joke and a revolution, with real applications but also extreme speculation.

#🧩 Phase 4: Institutionalization & The AI Convergence (2022 - 2025)

🏛 Wall Street Enters & AI Merges with Crypto


Ethereum transitions to Proof of Stake (2022): The biggest blockchain upgrade ever, PoW is left behind.

Bitcoin ETFs launch (2024): The traditional finance (TradFi) floodgates open—BlackRock, Fidelity, and institutions jump in.

Crypto & AI Merge (2024-2025): Decentralized AI marketplaces, blockchain-powered AGI models, AI agents running on-chain economies.

Regulation hits hard: The SEC, global governments, and centralized exchanges fight for control.

🔹 Theme: ""Crypto enters the real economy, AI-driven automation begins.""

🕰 Where we are? The transition from crypto as speculation to crypto as infrastructure.

#🚀 Phase 5: The Age of Autonomous Economies (2026 - ?)

🤖 Smart Contracts Evolve into Self-Sustaining AI Agents

AI-driven DAOs: Decentralized organizations fully run by AI, governing treasuries and executing transactions without human input.
AGI + Blockchain = Self-Learning Systems: Blockchain-based AI models that evolve, train, and operate independently.
Decentralized Compute: GPU & compute markets move on-chain, replacing centralized AI models like OpenAI & Google DeepMind.
Nation-State Adoption: More countries adopt crypto as legal tender, governments issue CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to compete.
Hyper-Bitcoinization? Or PoS Supremacy? The battle between Bitcoin’s ossification and smart contract-driven economic layers intensifies.

🔹 Theme: ""Autonomous on-chain economies, AI + Crypto fully merges, digital nations emerge.""

🕰 Where we're going? The dawn of self-sustaining blockchain ecosystems, where AI, finance, and governance operate without human intervention.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Binance takes a transaction fees on small amounts despite showing transaction fees=0,2025-02-13 22:28:57,"Hi, don't know if this is the correct sub for this or not so I'll post this anyway.

For a bit of context, I've been trading on binance with very small amounts( around 0.145usdt) that I received through red packets. The way this works is that I use the ""convert"" option whenever I want to ""buy"" a particular coin and it lets me do so with seemingly 0 transaction fees, or so I thought. Today I started with 0.147$ and made a gain of roughly 0.11%([not exactly this] not a lot ik, but I'm just practicing.) I was closing for the day, when I noticed that not only did I not have any of the profit, but my total amount was down to 0.145$ despite no transaction fees. I confirmed this by converting to another coin after which my total came back down to 0.143$. Now obviously these are really small amounts that won't really affect the overall portfolio of most traders, but if the app is telling me that there are no transaction fees, then there should be no deduction at all. Am I just tweaking or has anyone else noticed this as well? Is there anything I can do to prevent this or to better understand it? What does this mean for other traders who trade with larger amounts? Does Binance shave off a little bit of money from everyone's accounts without telling them as they did for me? 

Any input is appreciated

ETH is still the leading chain when it comes to smart contracts, and this first mover advantage will not go away, look at BTC, which is the best example for first mover advantage. Additionally, with the updated ETH, the network will become faster and cheaper, and even more reliant. No other chain is as reliant as ETH for smart contracts.

If ETH is going to 0, then all other alt coins will go down as well. It is the 3rd most traded coin and 3 times more than 4th place, meaning there is no head-on-head-race going on at all! Measuring on market cap, its place 2.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I have created a website that provides visualizations of transaction-speed/time-to-finality for different cryptocurrencies. Would love to know your thoughts.,2025-02-12 21:15:05,"[https://www.cryptosettlementtime.com/](https://www.cryptosettlementtime.com/)

I created this website to have place to compare how fast different cryptocurrencies take to fully confirm a transaction. Cryptocurrency settlement times, or time-to-finality, are essential to understand. They tell you how long it takes for a cryptocurrency transaction to be verified and considered irreversible on the blockchain.

For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which use probabilistic finality, confirmations are about reducing the probability of a transaction reversal. Each confirmation means more blocks are added to the chain after your transaction, making it increasingly difficult to alter. While absolute certainty is never reached, the chance of reversal becomes astronomically low with each confirmation. Bitcoin, for example, commonly uses 6 confirmations, with each block taking roughly 10 minutes, to reach a very high level of confidence in transaction finality.

However, not all cryptocurrencies work this way. Some, like Nano, offer deterministic finality. Here, a ""confirmation"" signifies a definitive agreement within the network, achieved through different consensus mechanisms. Once confirmed in a deterministic system, the transaction is considered absolutely final and irreversible.

It's important to differentiate settlement-time/time-to-finality from Transactions Per Second (TPS) and Blocks Per Second (BPS). TPS measures how many transactions a network can process per second, representing its transaction throughput. BPS, on the other hand, measures how many blocks are added to the blockchain each second, reflecting the rate of block creation. While a high TPS network can handle more transactions, and a higher BPS can increase the rate at which the blockchain grows, neither directly dictates settlement time/time to finality. The two are related but distinct concepts.

If any info on this website is incorrect i welcome your feedback, its hard to give a set time for settlement/finality for each crypto since it also depends on the state of the networks, and their consensus mechanism, but with this website i try to give an approximate number.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Wise investing, by true investors, requires patience, dedication, 
fortitude, resilience and emotionless conviction to one’s decisions. Does that sound like crypto bros? 

Seriously, I think 90% of retail is looking only to get rich quick and after it hasnt happened after 3-4 weeks, oh no… the bull run is over!! Crypto is dead, paper hand now for a loss… what a waste of liquidity that could be building a strong foundation that could actually propel this market the next leg up!! 
But nooo…. Zero frickn patience! No resilience to price swings, no dedication to seeing their decisions through!! And then you cry and wonder why market cap is declining?? 

Markets are built by strong hands; not paper-handed-Sally’s. I’ve done nothing but stack and fill bags for over 5 years now. I’d be lying if I said I wish I hadn’t taken some profits last bull but ya know what? My bags are that much heavier now and I know that my conviction and resilience will put me in a place you impatient twats can only dream of within the next 5 years.

First off Why does OM(Mantra) need to start with 972.15M out of Infinite Tokens in circulation? (distributed along many wallets so we think it's not heavily centralized)

Concept of parcially owning property with others is dumb. Those you did this in real life know it's a headache. Let alone with people you don't know...

Many properties can be vacant for long periods of time, Mantra only talks about revenue sharing, what about expenses? Don't worry they will sell Mantra for that you'll not pay a thing directly.

Maintenance? Legal issues, contractor problems? None of that matters, because Mantra tries to shift the focus to owning and getting money through staking nothing else matters.

In the end you have another token that represents what you think you own, and the team & VCs leave with heavy bags and the property.

if you'd look at my post history you'd quickly realize that I'm optimistic and engaged regarding the project, mainly as I see a real-world use-case in regions with no central banks.

I remember years ago when the project launched many people disregarded it as nothingburger due to ""mobile mining not being real"" but now, seeing the network has actually grown to be highly decentralized I feel like something valuable was created.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Looking for Games Similar to PancakeSwap Prediction,2025-02-12 18:41:17,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been playing the PancakeSwap Prediction game for a while, and I really enjoy the concept. For those who might not be familiar, it’s a simple yet engaging game where you predict whether the price of BNB will go up or down within a set timeframe. If your prediction is correct, you win a share of the prize pool. It’s like a mix of trading and betting but with a gamified experience.

I’m curious—does anyone know of any other games with a similar format? Specifically:
	•	Short-term price predictions (like 1-minute or 5-minute rounds)
	•	Crypto-based betting or prediction mechanics
	•	A fair and transparent system
	•	Decent rewards and active participation

I’ve come across a few platforms that offer prediction markets, but most seem to focus on long-term bets rather than quick, round-based games like PancakeSwap’s. If anyone has tried something similar—or even better, if you know of a platform with unique twists on the concept—I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks in advance!",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Reddit,crypto,Hashing conundrums,2024-12-20 20:49:23,"I have two questions about hashing that I thought might as well be merged into one post.

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

Are there any standard actually proper ways of doing something like this?",2025-02-14 00:52:19.565114

But what he did mean ?,2024-12-13 16:29:27,"There are many research papers that propose to lower the problem of fixed pairing inversion to exponentiation inversion. I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?
