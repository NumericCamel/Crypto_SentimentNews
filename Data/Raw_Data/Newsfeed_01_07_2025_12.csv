Bitcoin Spot Exchange Supply Has Seen A Sharp Plunge Recently In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the trend in the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory. This metric keeps track of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized spot exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps 20%, But Social Media Still Bearish: Green Signal For Rally? This part of the exchange supply refers to the actual tokens of the asset that exist on the blockchain. The exchange supply that doesn’t actually involve users to own BTC, as is the case with derivatives products, is known as “paper BTC.” When the spot exchange inventory rises, it means the investors are depositing a net number of coins into the wallets associated with these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders might transfer their BTC to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the exchange outflows are outweighing the exchange inflows. Investors usually take their coins off into self-custody when they plan to hold into the long-term, so this kind of trend can be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory saw a large plunge around the time of the FTX collapse back in November 2022. This suggests a large movement of coins occurred out of these platforms as the asset’s bear market reached its bottom. Following this plummet, the indicator started a phase of consolidation that lasted for the entirety of 2023 and most of 2024. The trend finally broke in the last couple of months of 2024, when the metric registered a sharp crash. These outflows came alongside Bitcoin’s exploration of new all-time highs, implying the accumulation from the investors might have played a role in the run. In total, 240,000 BTC exited the exchange-related wallets during this plunge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase Woo has pointed out that Microstrategy’s buying in this period summed up to about 192,000 BTC, which means there are other whales present in the market taking significant amounts off the exchanges. So far, the downtrend in the spot exchange inventory has shown no signs of reaching a bottom, as outflows have continued into 2025. If investors indeed keep up the accumulation in the near future as well, then Bitcoin could benefit from some further bullish momentum. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recovery in a sharp fashion during the last 24 hours as its price has broken back above the $101,700 mark.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Anticipating A ‘2025 Super Cycle’: Bitcoin Rallies With Trump’s Regulatory Reforms On The Horizon,2025-01-07 10:30:50+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the $100,000 threshold for the first time in two weeks, supported by revived momentum after the expected confirmation of Donald Trump’s US election win by Congress this week.  According to Bloomberg data, the market’s leading cryptocurrency climbed over 4% in the 24-hour time frame to hit $102,500 on Monday, recording a weekly rise of 11%—its highest surge since November 24. Bitcoin Rally Resumes: Surges Past $100,000 BTC’s performance in 2024 encountered a deceleration in late December as investors aimed to secure their gains. Nevertheless, enthusiasm for a pro-crypto government under Trump has rekindled interest, propelling Bitcoin to a record peak of $108,000.  As Congress prepares to assemble to certify Trump’s win, market sentiment appears optimistic. Khushboo Khullar, a venture partner at Lightning Ventures that invests in Bitcoin-related companies, stated, “A super cycle in 2025 is expected due to regulatory changes from the Trump administration.” Related Reading: Key Indicator Signals Buy On XRP 4-Hour Chart – Analyst Predicts A Price Rebound A notable surge of investment in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also fueled this momentum. On Friday, investors funneled a net $908 million into US Bitcoin ETFs.  This signaled the fifth-highest inflow since they were launched in January 2024, following a historic net outflow of $680 million on December 19. Another positive indicator for Bitcoin traders is the rebound of the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium, which gauges the price variance between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance.  Following its lowest point since Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX fell in 2022, the premium has recovered, indicating a rising demand for Bitcoin among US investors.  Joe McCann, the CEO of Asymmetric, a crypto hedge fund located in Miami, pointed out that ETF issuers mainly transact with Coinbase, which implies that the demand for ETFs can affect the premium or discount rates. Key Support Levels Under Scrutiny As the market looks towards 2025, Bloomberg highlights that Bitcoin’s path will significantly rely on Trump’s dedication to his crypto-related pledges, encompassing a national Bitcoin reserve.  Nonetheless, doubts persist about the longevity of the ongoing rally. A recent MLIV Pulse survey revealed that 39% of participants viewed Bitcoin as the investment most prone to becoming a loser in 2025, the highest share of all choices. Regarding technical analysis, market expert Morecryptoonl pointed out that Bitcoin has formed a more distinct five-wave pattern, with a bearish outcome that is still feasible if specific support levels are violated.  Related Reading: Litecoin Comeback: LTC Breaks Free And Guns For $400 At present, wave two is required to maintain support, while wave one is technically finished but is anticipated to reach a minimum of $100,800. Crucial support zones have been pinpointed between $93,144 and $96,554, which might be examined after wave one validates its peak. Concerning Bitcoin ETFs, Glassnode asserts that the purchasing trend continues to be robust, owing to seasonal influences. With Inauguration Day nearing, the market analysis firm expects a higher purchasing activity from traditional finance investors, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price movements further. At the time of writing, BTC has slipped back towards the $101,888 level but is still making significant gains on all time frames.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Enters Late Bull Cycle Stage, Says Analyst: What Investors Need to Know Now",2025-01-07 09:00:57+00:00,"The cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin, has often followed a pattern of alternating growth and decline cycles, reflecting investor sentiment and market fundamentals. Since the beginning of the current bull cycle in January 2023, Bitcoin has demonstrated substantial gains in both price and market duration. Increased capital inflows from new investors have supported this growth and existing participants are reinvesting their profits. However, recent indicators suggest that the market may now be entering the latter stages of this cycle, raising questions about what lies ahead for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: MARA CEO Advocates “Invest And Forget” Approach To Bitcoin, Citing Strong Historical Performance Key Indicators Point to Cautious Optimism A significant metric supporting this observation is the percentage of Bitcoin traded within the past month based on realized market cap – UTXO, which currently sits at 36%, according to a recent analysis shared by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Dan. In the analysis, Dan reveals that while this figure remains lower than peak levels observed in previous bull cycles, its downward trajectory suggests that the market is “progressing toward its cycle peak.” Dan anticipates that this peak could occur sometime between Q1 and Q2 of 2025. However, rather than a single explosive surge, historical trends indicate that the ratio could experience sharp increases two to four more times before the cycle concludes. This pattern typically signals market overheating, followed by a subsequent correction or bear cycle. Dan further highlighted that while the market still holds potential for gains, a conservative approach to risk management is advisable. Historically, late-stage bull cycles have been marked by increased volatility, as profit-taking begins to influence market behavior. Dan wrote: Nevertheless, from a conservative standpoint and with risk management in mind, caution is advised. For this reason, I am planning to gradually sell my holdings. Another critical observation from on-chain data is the relationship between short-term traders and long-term holders. Historically, a sharp increase in short-term trading activity often precedes a market correction. Traders who entered the market during recent price rallies may begin to sell off their holdings, leading to temporary downward pressure on prices. Conversely, long-term holders often remain resilient during these periods, providing a stabilizing force in the market. Bitcoin Sees Recovery As The New Year Begins After weeks of struggling and remaining below $100,000 in the last month of 2024, Bitcoin appears to have now resumed its bullish momentum as the first month of 2025 commences. Although, BTC entered the new year with a price below $95,000. However, a few days later, the asset continued its upward momentum, reclaiming the $100,000 price mark to currently trade at a price of $101,624. At the time of writing, BTC recorded a 3.9% increase in the past day bringing its price closer to its recently established all-time high above $108,000 last month.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Altcoins Future Unveiled: Will The Market Ascend To New Heights Or Hit A Roadblock?,2025-01-07 07:30:01+00:00,"As the cryptocurrency market experiences a notable resurgence, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to lead the charge, while altcoins—especially Cardano (ADA)—are making significant gains.  Altcoins Market On The Cusp Of Change: Will Bullish Momentum Prevail? Market expert Patrick H recently shared insights on social media, stating, “The altcoins market is attempting to build a new bullish structure. Are we heading for higher levels, or is another rejection more likely?”  This query shared among market players signifies the careful optimism present in the altcoin realm as it contemplates the possibilities of a trend reversal. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $11 Breakout, But A Correction Might Come First—Analyst On this matter, the expert unveiled in a recent analysis that the daily chart of the total altcoin market cap (excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies) reveals important developments.  After enduring a prolonged bearish phase characterized by a descending channel—marked by lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL)—the market appears to be on the verge of a significant shift. In addition, recent activity indicates a breakout from this descending channel, suggesting that bearish momentum may be waning. Importantly, a higher low (HL) has formed around the $330 billion mark, establishing a critical support level, serving as the first indication of a possible bullish shift in the market’s trajectory. Currently, the altcoin market is facing resistance at the $375 billion level, where it is consolidating following the breakout. For a full confirmation of a bullish market structure shift, the market must achieve a clear higher high (HH) at approximately $400 billion.  Successfully breaking this level would solidify the reversal and could lead to a rally targeting $600 billion as the next local stop. Conversely, if the market experiences a failed breakout—failing to reclaim the $400 billion mark and subsequently reversing—investors should closely monitor key support levels at $330 billion and $317 billion.  A retest of the descending channel breakout could occur, and a breakdown below $317 billion would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling a potential return to the downtrend. Can Cardano Continue Its Impressive Price Climb? Over the past week, Cardano has emerged as a standout performer, experiencing a substantial price increase of 31%. This surge has enabled the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to regain the critical $1.11 level. In stark contrast, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, recently achieved a new all-time high of $108,000. Despite this, Cardano’s current price remains over 64% below its all-time high of $3.09, which was reached in September 2021. However, with the bullish scenarios outlined by market expert Patrick H. indicating a potential rally in the altcoin market in the coming months, Cardano and other altcoins may continue to experience upward price momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? All around, the altcoins market stands at a crucial juncture.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Trump-Fuelled Bitcoin Rally May Fade Ahead Of January FOMC Meeting: Report,2025-01-07 06:00:53+00:00,"A recent report by digital assets research firm 10x Research highlights that the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) stance on interest rate cuts remains the most significant hurdle that could dampen the current Bitcoin (BTC) rally. Bitcoin’s Trump-Fuelled Rally At Risk Ahead Of FOMC Meeting Since pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump secured victory in the November presidential election, Bitcoin has climbed an impressive 47%, rising from approximately $67,500 on November 4 to around $99,700 as of January 6. Related Reading: Metaplanet Bitcoin Reserves Grow With Fresh $61 Million Purchase While further gains are anticipated during the so-called “Trump rally” leading up to the January 20 inauguration, the momentum might stall ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later in January, says 10x Research’s Markus Thielen. Thielen predicts a “positive start” to January for BTC, followed by a slight dip before the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data release on January 15. A favorable CPI report could reignite optimism, potentially fueling another rally before Trump’s inauguration. However, Thielen cautions that bullish momentum may wane ahead of the FOMC meeting on January 29. Latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows that interest rates are likely to remain unchanged following the upcoming FOMC meeting. The tool currently predicts a 90.9% chance of interest rates remaining 425 and 450 basis points (BPS). Bitcoin’s decline of approximately 15% to $92,900 following the December 18 FOMC meeting underscores the Fed’s significant influence. This drop came after the Fed signaled only two rate cuts for 2025 instead of five, reinforcing Thielen’s view that the Fed’s decisions are the “primary risk” to BTC’s current bullish trajectory. Thielen stated: We anticipate lower inflation this year, though it may take some time for the Federal Reserve to recognize and respond to this shift formally. Thielen also cited institutional participation as a key factor influencing Bitcoin’s short-term price action, with metrics like stablecoin minting rates and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows serving as indicators of institutional interest. Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Continues To Rise Although US spot Bitcoin ETFs faced significant outflows at the end of December, fresh inflows have sparked optimism about rising institutional interest in the premier cryptocurrency. Data from SoSoValue notes that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $908 million in inflows on January 3. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report In addition, several major BTC mining firms such as MARA and Hut 8 are bolstering their BTC reserves.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Crypto Trader Makes $21 Million From AI Agent Token As Sectors Faces Backlash,2025-01-07 04:30:33+00:00,"Some crypto traders have made millions of dollars from the latest leading narrative, Artificial Intelligence (AI) related tokens. However, the sector’s quick rise in popularity has received backlash from several community members and industry figures, who consider the tokens “worse” than the memecoin trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $100K – Is the Bull Run Resuming or a Correction Ahead? Crypto Traders Make Millions From AI-Related Tokens On January 6, on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain shared that a smart Solana trader obtained massive returns from AI agent and memecoin ai16z (AI16Z). The investor turned $2 million into $21 million in less than two months amid the AI-related tokens rally. The AI-managed crypto fund is on the Solana blockchain and governed by the ai16zDAO. Its name is a wordplay originating from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, seemingly created to bring attention to the project. According to the post, the whale purchased 10.6 million ai16z, worth $2.27 million, between November 15 and November 22, 2024, at an average cost of $0.214. Since then, the cryptocurrency has seen a 965% surge to trade around $2.28. At the time of the report, the investor’s holdings were valued at around $21 million, making $19 million in unrealized profits. Earlier today, the whale sent 5.3 million ai16z, worth $10.68 million, into Jupiter to sell via limit order. Meanwhile, another trader turned $123,000 into $4.5 million after betting on ai16z when the token’s market capitalization was $22 million. The whale purchased 6.17 million ai16z and sold 4.67 million for around $1.78 million last month. The investor currently holds 2.65 million ai16z tokens, valued at $2.9 million, bringing the total profits to more than $4.5 million in two months. This whale also made another $13.4 million from other AI crypto tokens like GOAT, FARTCOIN, and ARC. Community Calls AI Agent Tokens ‘Overrated’ In late 2024, AI Agent tokens gained massive popularity among crypto investors, with several experts predicting that AI-related tokens, alongside memecoins, would be the largest narrative of this year. Meanwhile, AI memecoins stole the spotlight as the year ended, sending some of the tokens in the sector to the top 10 memecoins ranks in late December. Ai16z, the largest AI memecoin by market capitalization, has seen a 251% increase in the past month, hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $2.47 on January 2. The token is also the third-largest AI agent crypto and has seen a 25% surge in the last 24 hours, trading between $2.25 and $2.28 throughout Monday morning. Nonetheless, the sector has received heavy criticism recently from the crypto community. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT recently called AI agent tokens a scam. Responding to Justin Taylor, another industry member, the crypto detective stated that “99% of it is a scam” and suggested that “the AI agent wrapper grifts are probably worse than other past trends.” Related Reading: Litecoin Comeback: LTC Breaks Free And Guns For $400 Zach argued that memecoins “at least” promised nothing, “AI coins try to larp as much as possible to appear legit to unsuspecting buyers.” Similarly, Solana founders consider AI agent tokens to be overhyped. According to an anonymous poll of 42 Solana founders, several of the polled considered AI Agents, alongside Blinks, to be the “most overrated Solana sector.” Despite the criticism, the sector still registers a 5% increase in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $2.28 billion and a market capitalization of $17.5 billion, according to CoinGecko data.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,MicroStrategy Strikes Again: $100 Million Bitcoin Purchase Signals Strong Market Confidence,2025-01-07 03:00:06+00:00,"MicroStrategy, the major enterprise software company that has evolved into a Bitcoin (BTC) investment platform, has captured attention once again with its latest purchase of $101 million in BTC. The company, led by chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor, has committed to utilizing perpetual preferred stock, common shares, and debt to fuel its ongoing Bitcoin purchasing strategy. MicroStrategy Eyes $42 Billion Capital Raise By 2027 In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy disclosed that it purchased 1,070 Bitcoin tokens at an average price of approximately $94,000 on December 30 and 31, 2024.  This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 447,470 BTC, acquired for around $27.97 billion at an average price of $62,503 per Bitcoin.  Notably, Saylor highlighted in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that the company achieved a Bitcoin yield of 48% for the fourth quarter of 2024 and 74.3% for the entire fiscal year. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $11 Breakout, But A Correction Might Come First—Analyst MicroStrategy’s ambitious plans extend beyond Bitcoin acquisitions. On Friday, the firm announced its intention to raise up to $2 billion through offerings of perpetual preferred stock, which will hold seniority over its Class A common stock.  This move is part of a larger strategy to raise $42 billion in capital by 2027 through various means, including at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings. With more than two-thirds of its equity goals already met, the company is expected to pivot towards fixed-income markets in the near future. The demand for MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has notably increased among hedge funds, which are employing convertible arbitrage strategies that involve purchasing bonds and short-selling shares.  This strategy capitalizes on the volatility of MicroStrategy’s stock, a characteristic that has become a cornerstone of its business model. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer remarked: That volatility itself is a key element of MicroStrategy’s approach because it enables the company to tap into the capital markets and particularly the convertible bond market more easily. MicroStrategy’s recent proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion has sparked fears of share dilution, leading to a significant drop in the company’s stock price.  MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy Faces Headwinds  On the day of the proxy filing in December, shares fell by as much as 9.6%. Adam Kobeissi, founder of The Kobeissi Letter, noted the dilemma faced by investors, stating:  It’s a lose-lose because on one hand you have people saying that it’s dilutive and they’re selling the stock… but on the other hand you have people saying if it doesn’t pass, then they can’t keep buying Bitcoin and the whole investment strategy is kind of broken. A vote on the share increase is scheduled for January 21, 2025, and with Saylor being a significant shareholder, the amendment is expected to pass. Should it be approved, the increase in shares could lead to further volatility in MicroStrategy’s stock price as the company becomes more leveraged.  Although the company has typically outperformed Bitcoin, it has faced challenges in recent months, underlining that its performance is influenced by factors beyond just cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Price on the Rise: Can Momentum Fuel Bigger Gains? Despite the recent fluctuations, Palmer maintains a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy’s stock. He believes the market’s reaction to the proposed share increase has been an overreaction.  “The company’s strategy has been to issue shares to make accretive Bitcoin purchases which can accrue to the benefit of shareholders,” he commented. MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach to Bitcoin acquisitions has seen it make significant purchases exceeding $1 billion in late 2024, although recent weeks have seen a slowdown in these activities amidst fluctuating Bitcoin prices.  Palmer reassured investors, stating, “We’ve seen a pull forward of the company’s strategy, which is not indicative of a slowdown… it’s more a reflection of the aggressive approach that the company has taken.” At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is inching closer to the $100,000 milestone, trading at $99,340, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

They aren’t the same address sending the small amounts either. Why is this happening like I haven’t lost any money but like this kind of sketchy.

Reddit,solana,Want to know how I've already made over 100k this year?,2025-01-06 00:44:01,"
I'm feeling generous with a secret.
 
Go through and check out new coins being made on Dexscreener. Search the creator wallets until you find rug factory wallets. Then,  hit up SolanaFM, enter their wallet address and watch them transfer profits to a bew address. Follow the new one, you'll see them make a new coin and you can get the CA minutes before its posted on Dex. SolanaFM shows the token name and CA before it migrates to Dexscreener which gives you time to enter the CA into your your market and spam the buy till your order goes through. 

This has given me the chance at being the first buyer many many times.  I buy around 2 to 20 sol worth, then sell before the rug factory dump.The factoey usually follows a pattern of when they dump. The last one was at 60% market cap OR immediate rug (yep, still risk involved). Typically 3 out of 10 new coins they create will autosell at creation.

The times they dont, I sell at 40k or 50k marketcap as this factory trended at 60k. The profits are better than you'll believe, especially at 20 sol buy in. 

 
Once they rug, I watch that wallet send their profits to a new wallet and then start a new coin and I do it all over again.

Trumpius on Sol is made by a dedicated dev team. They aren't here to make money themselves. The dev burned his bag and started a wallet pure for boosting and marketing funds. Coingecko, dexscreener boost and dextool has been fixed and paid for. The website looks great and they even have a whitepaper. 

The team isn't looking for any short term pumps. They have real plans ready and have already gotten 400 dedicated community members in their group just from organic growth. This coin isn't even 2 days old and already holding the 100k mc floor strong. 

We're actively searching for more dedicated members before starting our agressive marketing campaign and start uncovering our partnerships. I can't tell too much, but this will be great. It's a coin ready for millions.

The team is working on an AI utility which they sneakpeeked at the AMA yesterday on X. They're also looking forward to start a P2E game. Another way to expand the project and get attention of bigger projects to collaborate with.

I bought some more today, because 100k is very undervalued. Don't fade this.

Ever wondered how tokens work on the Solana blockchain? What does a “create token account” transaction mean?

https://preview.redd.it/nj77i7j1mgbe1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5c450c74be676992742c1c1438a82288d852ec

Unlike some other blockchains, Solana uses a special system called “associated token accounts” to handle tokens efficiently and securely. Let’s break it down in a way that’s easy to understand, with examples you can relate to!

# What Is an Associated Token Account (ATA)?

Imagine you’ve got a locker at school. Each locker is labeled with your name and can only store one type of item — say books, snacks, or gym clothes. On Solana, an associated token account is like your personal locker for a specific token. It’s tied to your wallet (your unique ID) and can only hold one kind of token, like USDC or Bonk or Pengu.

This setup keeps everything organized and easy to find. It also ensures that tokens are stored safely in the right place.

# Why Do You Need an ATA?

Here’s the deal: before you can use a token — whether to buy something, trade, or receive an airdrop — you need a specific locker (an ATA) for that token. Without it, you’d have nowhere to store the token! Let’s look at some reasons why this is important:

1. **Organization:** Everyone’s tokens are stored in their own lockers, so it’s clear who owns what.
2. **Compatibility:** Apps and games on Solana know where to look for your tokens because ATAs follow a standard design.
3. **Simplicity:** You don’t need to manually manage different accounts. The system does it for you!

# How Do You Create an ATA?

Typically, ATAs are created automatically as a part of a buy or transfer transaction. All wallets, trading platforms, and bots handle this for you.

However, sometimes users might want to create an ATA in a separate transaction:

1. This can make your buy or transfer transaction “smaller,” which increases the chances of it being processed faster — especially during times of high network traffic.
2. On the flip side, some spammers take advantage of this system by creating lots of unnecessary ATA transactions trying to trick other people into buying their tokens.

Associated token accounts might sound complicated at first, but they’re really just a clever way to keep track of tokens on Solana. Think of them as your personal lockers — safe, organized, and ready for anything. Whether you’re playing games, trading, or just holding tokens, ATAs make it all work smoothly.

So next time you hear about “create associated token account” transactions, you’ll know it’s just Solana setting up a locker for your tokens. Easy, right? Now go out there and explore the world of Solana!",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

# Introduction

*“We knew smaller, faster, cheaper better than anybody else in the world, and now we're applying those concepts to blockchain.” — Greg Fitzgerald, Solana co-founder*

Solana is a high-performance, low-latency blockchain renowned for its speed, efficiency, and focus on user experience. Its unique integrated architecture enables thousands of transactions per second across a globally decentralized network. With a block time of 400 milliseconds and transaction fees that are fractions of a cent, it delivers on both speed and cost-effectiveness. This report delves into the intricacies of Solana's design and operation, exploring the key mechanisms and network topology that contribute to its capabilities.

Solana takes an integrated approach to blockchain development, leveraging the founding team's decades of experience in building distributed systems. One of Solana's core principles is that software should never get in the way of hardware. This means that software exploits whatever hardware it runs on to the fullest and scales with it. As a unified ecosystem, all applications built on top of this single blockchain inherit composability, enabling them to interact and build upon each other seamlessly. This architecture also ensures a straightforward and intuitive user experience without the need for bridging, separate chain IDs, or liquidity fragmentation.

https://preview.redd.it/kc6staudogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2c5dc96b71a597fda65fc0b623806f1e4c0d0e0

Solana is evolving rapidly, with recent developments including SVM rollups and [ZK Compression](https://www.zkcompression.com/) as important scaling solutions. While these projects may one day shape our future perception of Solana, they are currently in the very early stages of development or adoption and will not be covered in this report.

# Transaction Lifecycle

Our primary lens for understanding Solana throughout this report will be the lifecycle of a typical transaction. To construct a basic model for understanding Solana transactions, we can outline the process as follows: 

https://preview.redd.it/y27ncoggogbe1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f24f7d74ee34e53e7e15ad616c291587de0885b

* Users initiate transactions, all of which are sent to the current lead block producer (known as the leader). The leader compiles these transactions into a block, executing them and thereby updating their local state.
* This block of transactions is then propagated throughout the network for other validators to execute and confirm.

The subsequent sections of this report will expand this model and delve into this process in much greater detail, beginning with the key participants—the users.

# Remember

*Substantial changes to the core Solana protocol go through a formal, transparent* [*process*](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md) *of submitting a Solana Improvement Document (SIMD) which community members and core engineering will publicly critique. SIMDs are then voted on by the network.*

# Six stages

https://preview.redd.it/bb6i7wxjogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d445455affd3993d91da00bf732ea4c01128a7

We will reference the six-stage visual shown above throughout this report, as it offers us a consistent framework for understanding the relationships between Solana's core elements.

Earlier chapters are arranged according to these six stages. The final chapters—Gossip, Archive, Economics, and Jito—tie up any loose ends. It’s important to note that some chapters will span multiple stages, and some stages will appear in multiple chapters.

This overlap is unavoidable because the six-stage framework has its limitations. In reality, Solana is a complex distributed system with many interdependent elements.

# Users

*“Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto” — Raj Gokal, Solana co-founder*

A user's journey typically begins by setting up and funding a wallet application. Multiple popular wallet applications are available for Solana, either as native mobile applications or browser extensions.

Wallets cryptographically generate user keypairs, consisting of public and private keys. The public key acts as the unique identifier for their account and is known by all participants in the network. A user’s account on Solana can be considered a data structure that holds information and state related to their interactions with the Solana blockchain. In this way, a public key is similar to a filename: just as a filename uniquely identifies a file within a file system, a Solana public key uniquely identifies an account on the Solana blockchain. Public keys on Solana are represented as 32-byte Base58-encoded strings.

`FDKJvWcJNe6wecbgDYDFPCfgs14aJnVsUfWQRYWLn4Tn`

A private key — also known as a secret key —can be considered as the password or access key that grants permission to access and modify the account. Signing with private keys is how blockchains handle authorization. Knowledge of the private key gives absolute authority over the account. Solana private keys are also 32-bytes in length. Keypairs are the 64-byte combinations of public (first half) and private (second half) keys. Examples:

`3j15jr41S9KmdfughusutvvqBjAeEDbU5sDQp8EbwQ3Hify2pfM1hiEsuFFAVq8bwGywnZpswrbDzPENbBZbd5nj`

`[63,107,47,255,141,135,58,142,191,245,78,18,90,162,107,197,8,33,211,15,228,235,250,30,185,122,105,23,147,115,115,86,8,155,67,155,110,51,117,0,19,150,143,217,132,205,122,91,167,61,6,246,107,39,51,110,185,81,13,81,16,182,30,71]`

Private keys can also be derived from mnemonic seed phrases, usually 12 or 24 words long. This format is often used in wallets for easier backup and recovery. Multiple keys can be derived deterministically from a single seed phrase.

Solana utilizes [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519), a widely used elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, for its public-key cryptography needs. Ed25519 is favored for its small key size, small signature size, fast computation, and immunity to many common attacks. Each Solana wallet address represents a point on the Ed25519 elliptic curve.

The user signs transactions with their private key. This signature is included with the transaction data and can be verified by other participants using the sender's public key. This process ensures the transaction has not been tampered with and is authorized by the owner of the corresponding private key. The signature also acts as a unique identifier for the transaction.

# Solana Transactions

Sending a transaction is the only way to mutate state on Solana. Any write operation is performed through a transaction, and transactions are atomic—either everything the transaction attempts to do happens or the transaction fails. A transaction, more formally known as a ""transaction message,"" comprises four sections: a header, a list of account addresses, a recent blockhash, and instructions.

https://preview.redd.it/yl7lvpouogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5349733808055e00bf0a209ed2174abd529619d7

* Header: The header contains references to the account address list, indicating which accounts must sign the transaction.
* Account Addresses: This list includes all the accounts that will be read from or written to during the transaction. Building such a list for every transaction is a requirement unique to Solana and can be challenging for developers. However, knowing in advance which pieces of state a transaction will interact with enables optimizations not possible on many other blockchains.
* Recent Blockhash: This is used to prevent duplicate and stale transactions. A recent blockhash expires after 150 blocks (about 1 minute). By default, RPCs attempt to forward transactions every 2 seconds until the transaction is either finalized or the recent blockhash expires, at which point the transaction is dropped.
* Instructions: These form the core part of the transaction. Each instruction represents a specific operation (e.g., transfer, mint, burn, create account, close account). Each instruction specifies the program to execute, the accounts required, and the data needed for the instruction's execution.

The number of instructions in a transaction is limited first by its size, which can be up to 1,232 bytes. There are also limits around the number of accounts that can be referenced. Lastly, there are limits to a transaction’s complexity measured in compute units (CUs). CUs quantify the computational resources expended in processing transactions.

# Remember

*The smallest unit of SOL is known as a ""lamport,"" equivalent to one billionth of a SOL, similar to a satoshi in Bitcoin. The lamport is named after* [*Leslie Lamport*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)*, a computer scientist and mathematician whose research established many theoretical foundations of modern distributed systems.*

The cost in SOL to execute a transaction is separated into 2 parts - a base fee and a prioritization fee. The base fee is a fixed 5000 lamports per signature cost irrespective of the transaction’s complexity—usually, there is 1 signature per transaction.

Prioritization fees are technically optional, but during periods of high demand for blockspace become necessary. These fees are priced in micro-lamports (millionth of a lamport) per compute unit. Their purpose is to act as a price signal, making transactions more economically compelling for validator nodes to include in their blocks. 

`total fee = prioritization fee + base fee`

`prioritization fee = compute unit price (micro-lamports) x compute unit limit`

Currently, 50% of all transaction-related fees are burnt, permanently removing this SOL from circulation with the remaining 50% going to the block producer. A new change (SIMD 96) is soon to be introduced allowing for 100% of prioritization fees to go to the block producer. Base fees remain unchanged.

# Sending transactions

https://preview.redd.it/ciea7ftyogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0407e01298915f6b4310da6b5271465500f8be7d

A user connects their wallet to the application, allowing the app to read the user’s public key. The private key remains encrypted and securely sandboxed in a separate environment from the application.

The application builds the transaction message parameters based on the user’s interactions. For example, if a user wanted to swap two tokens, they would specify the amount of tokens to buy, the corresponding tokens to sell, and an acceptable transaction slippage.

‍Once the transaction message is ready, it is sent to the wallet to be signed with the user’s private key. At this point, the user is prompted with a popup to confirm their willingness to transact. This popup may include a simulation of the transaction’s results. Once signed, the transaction message and the signature are returned to the app, which can then forward the transaction to an RPC provider of their choice, either their own or by using the wallet’s provider.

‍RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers act as intermediaries between applications and the validators that build blocks. They are an essential service that enables applications to [submit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/cd6f931223181d5a1d47cba64e857785a175a760/rpc/src/rpc.rs#L3396) or simulate signed transactions and efficiently retrieve on-chain data. Applications that wish to interact with the network do so via a JSON-RPC or a WebSocket endpoint ([docs](https://solana.com/docs/rpc)).

# Remember

*The term “failed transaction” on Solana is misleading and has caused considerable confusion. These transactions incur fees and are executed successfully by the runtime exactly as the signer intended. They “fail” due to the transaction’s own logic requiring them to do so. +80% of “failed” transactions come from error code 0x1771, the code for exceeding slippage amount (*[*data*](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/zapokorny/q/18zuYlugBdcm/solana-failed-txs-by-program)*). Notably, 95% of these transactions are submitted by only 0.1% of active Solana addresses, primarily automated bots attempting to take advantage of time-sensitive price arbitrage opportunities.*

# Gulf Stream

*“Literally the goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world — so speed of light through fiber. Who we’re competing with is NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) refer to RPC nodes. These nodes can be thought of as gateways to interact with and read data from the network. They run the same software as full validators but with different settings, allowing them to accurately simulate transactions and maintain an up-to-date view of the current state. As of this writing, there are over 4,000 RPC nodes on the Solana network.

‍Unlike full validator nodes, RPC nodes do not hold any stake in the network. Without stake, they cannot vote or build blocks. This setup differs from most other blockchains, where the validator and RPC nodes are typically the same. Since RPC nodes do not receive staking rewards, the economics of running RPC nodes are distinct from those of validators with many operating as a paid service for developers running Solana applications.

‍Solana stands out because it was designed from the outset to operate without a mempool. Unlike traditional blockchains that use gossip protocols to randomly and broadly propagate transactions across the network, Solana forwards all transactions to a predetermined lead validator, known as the leader, for each slot.

https://preview.redd.it/efimg7g5pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ddc929f7c96b3eb528f3d8768388853e1c62db

# Callout

*Solana operates four clusters: Localnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet-Beta. When people refer to Solana or the Solana network, they almost always refer to Mainnet-Beta. Mainnet-Beta is the only cluster where tokens hold real value, while the other clusters are used solely for testing purposes.*

‍Once an RPC receives a transaction message to be included in a block, it must be forwarded to the leader. A leader schedule is produced before every epoch (approximately every two days). The upcoming epoch is divided into slots, each fixed at 400 milliseconds, and a leader is chosen for each slot. Validators with a higher stake will be chosen more often to become leader within each epoch. During each slot, transaction messages are forwarded to the leader, who has the opportunity to produce a block. When it is a validator’s turn, they switch to ""leader mode,"" begin actively processing transactions and broadcasting blocks to the rest of the network.

# ‍Stake-Weighted Quality of Service - SWQoS

‍In early 2024, Solana introduced a new mechanism aimed at preventing spam and enhancing Sybil resistance, known as ""Stake-Weighted Quality of Service"" (SWQoS). This system enables leaders to prioritize transaction messages that are proxied through other staked validators. Here, validators with a higher stake are granted a proportionally higher capacity to transmit transaction message packets to the leader. This approach effectively mitigates Sybil attacks from non-staked nodes across the network.

https://preview.redd.it/gacy1qn8pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e510254be8f3dfe4465bb02297771ec19e98024

Under this model, validators can also engage in agreements to lease their stake-weighted capacity to RPC nodes. In return, RPC nodes gain increased bandwidth, allowing them to achieve greater transaction inclusion rates in blocks. Notably, 80% of a leader’s capacity (2,000 connections) is reserved for SWQoS. The remaining 20% (500 connections) is allocated for transaction messages from non-staked nodes. This allocation strategy mirrors priority lanes on highways, where drivers pay a toll to avoid traffic.

‍SWQoS has impacted the Solana ecosystem by raising the requirements to forward transactions to the leader and reducing the effectiveness of spam attacks. The change has incentivized high-traffic applications to vertically integrate their operations. By running their own validator nodes, or by having access to staked connections, applications can ensure privileged access to the leader, thereby enhancing their transaction processing capabilities.

# ‍A QUIC Note

‍In late 2022, Solana adopted the [QUIC networking protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to manage transaction message transmission to the leader. This transition was prompted by network disruptions caused by bots spamming on-chain NFT mints. QUIC facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication.

https://preview.redd.it/hqfeng0bpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a7002fb6203d3e7535299c6a4340f55cc8927d

Initially developed by [Google](https://research.google/pubs/the-quic-transport-protocol-design-and-internet-scale-deployment/) in 2012, QUIC attempts to offer the best of both worlds. It facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication similar to UDP, but with the secure sessions and advanced flow control strategies of TCP. This allows for limits to be placed on individual sources of traffic so that the network can focus on processing genuine transactions. It also has a concept of separate streams; so if one transaction is dropped, it doesn’t need to block the remaining ones. In short, QUIC can be thought of as attempting to combine the best characteristics of TCP and UDP.

# ‍Callout box

*Stake-weighting is a recurring principle found throughout Solana's systems, encompassing voting rewards, turbine trees, leader schedules, Gulf Stream, and the gossip network. Validators with greater stake are accorded higher trust and prioritized roles in the network.*

# ‍Block Building

*“We consider SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) the best in terms of virtual machine technology currently.” — Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation*

Many blockchain networks construct entire blocks before broadcasting them, known as discrete block building. Solana, in contrast, employs continuous block building which involves assembling and streaming blocks dynamically as they are created during an allocated time slot, significantly reducing latency.

‍Each slot lasts 400 milliseconds, and each leader is assigned four consecutive slots (1.6 seconds) before rotation to the next leader. For a block to gain acceptance, all transactions within it must be valid and reproducible by other nodes.

‍Two slots before assuming leadership, a validator halts transaction forwarding to prepare for its upcoming workload. During this interval, inbound traffic spikes, reaching over a gigabyte per second as the entire network directs packets to the incoming leader.

‍Upon receipt, transaction messages enter the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), the validator's core logic responsible for block production. Here, the transaction processing sequence begins with the Fetch Stage, where transactions are received via QUIC. Subsequently, transactions progress to the SigVerify Stage, undergoing rigorous validation checks. Here the validator verifies the validity of signatures, checks for the correct number of signatures, and eliminates duplicate transactions.

https://preview.redd.it/tfq1r9pfpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07e829c1264f29fab5b9e1752ad2ec1048b3593

# Banking Stage

The banking stage can be described as the block-building stage. It is the most important stage of the TPU, which gets its name from the “bank“. A bank is just the state at a given block. For every block, Solana has a bank that is used to access state at that block. When a block becomes finalized after enough validators vote on it, they will flush account updates from the bank to disk, making them permanent. The final state of the chain is the result of all confirmed transactions. This state can always be recreated from the blockchain history deterministically.

‍Transactions are processed in parallel and packaged into ledger “entries,” which are batches of 64 non-conflicting transactions. Parallel transaction processing on Solana is made easy because each transaction must include a complete list of all the accounts it will read and write to. This design choice places a burden on developers but allows the validator to avoid race conditions by easily selecting only non-conflicting transactions for execution within each entry. Transactions conflict if they both attempt to write to the same account (two writes) or if one attempts to read from and the other writes to the same account (read + write). Thus conflicting transactions go into different entries and are executed sequentially, while non-conflicting transactions are executed in parallel.

‍There are six threads processing transactions in parallel, with four dedicated to normal transactions and two exclusively handling vote transactions which are integral to Solana’s consensus mechanism. All parallelization of processing is achieved through multiple CPU cores; validators have no GPU requirements ([docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements)).

‍Once transactions have been grouped into entries, they are ready to be executed by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The accounts necessary for the transaction are locked; checks are run to confirm the transaction is recent but hasn’t already been processed. The accounts are loaded, and the transaction logic is executed, updating the account states. A hash of the entry will be sent to the Proof of History service to be recorded (more on this in the next section). If the recording process is successful, all changes will be committed to the bank, and the locks on each account placed in the first step are lifted. Execution is done by the SVM, a virtual machine built using the Solana fork of [rBPF](https://docs.rs/solana_rbpf/latest/solana_rbpf/), a library for working with JIT compilation, and virtual machines for eBPF programs. Note Solana does not mandate how validators choose to order transactions within a block. This flexibility is a crucial point that we will return to later in the Economics + Jito section of this report.

# ‍Remember

*The term SVM can be ambiguous, as it may refer to either the ""Solana Virtual Machine"" or the ""Sealevel Virtual Machine."" Both terms describe the same concept, with Sealevel being the name of Solana's runtime environment. The term SVM continues to be loosely thrown around despite recent efforts to precisely* [*define its boundaries*](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/anzas-new-svm-api)*.*

# ‍Clients

‍Solana is a network comprising thousands of independently operated nodes collaborating to maintain a single unified ledger. Each node constitutes a high-performance machine running the same open-source software known as a “client”.

‍Solana launched with a single validator client software — originally the Solana Labs client, now known as the [Agave client ](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave)— written in Rust. Expanding client diversity has been a priority ever since and one that will truly come to fruition with the launch of the [Firedancer client](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer). Firedancer is a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language. Built by an experienced team from high-frequency trading firm Jump, it promises to be the most performant validator client on any blockchain.

https://preview.redd.it/c1jtsnikpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f25b5a0c4bab8b408d32adf46449cd8e28887e

# Proof of History

*“I had two coffees and a beer, and I was up until 4:00 AM. I had this eureka moment that puzzle \[sic\] similar to proof of work using the same SHA-256 preimage-resistant hash function… I knew that I had this arrow of time.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Proof of History (PoH) is Solana's secret sauce, functioning like a special clock in every validator that facilitates synchronization across the network. PoH establishes a reliable source of truth for the order of events and the passage of time. Most critically it ensures adherence to the leader schedule. Despite similar names, Proof of History is not a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work.

https://preview.redd.it/5m9vzdnppgbe1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b68f99530f62595829ba76bdf159cb127f2940

Communication overhead between nodes typically increases as networks expand, and coordination becomes increasingly complicated. Solana mitigates this by replacing node-to-node communication with a PoH local computation. This means validators can commit to a block with just a single round of voting. Trusted timestamps in messages ensure that validators cannot step over each other and start their blocks prematurely.

Underlying PoH are the unique properties of hashing algorithms, specifically [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2):

* **Deterministic:** The same input will always produce the same hash.
* **Fixed Size:** Regardless of input size, the output hash is always 256 bits.
* **Efficient:** It is fast to compute the hash for any given input.
* [**Preimage Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack)**:** Finding the original input from the hash output is computationally infeasible.
* **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input (even a single bit) results in a significantly different hash, a property known as the avalanche effect.
* [**Collision Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance)**:** It is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

Within each validator client, a dedicated ""Proof of History service"" continually runs the SHA256 hash algorithm creating a chain of hashes. Each hash’s input is the previous hash's output. This chain acts the same as a verifiable delay function, given that the hashing work must be done in sequence and the results of future hashes cannot be known ahead of time. If the PoH service creates a chain of a thousand hashes, we know time has passed for it to have calculated each hash sequentially — this can be thought of as a “micro proof of work.” Yet, other validators can verify the correctness of the thousand hashes in parallel at a much faster rate than they were produced since the input and output of each hash have been broadcast to the network. Therefore, PoH is difficult to produce but easy to verify.

The range of performance in computing SHA-256 across different CPUs is surprisingly narrow, with only small differences among the fastest machines. A common upper limit has already been reached, despite significant time and effort being invested in optimizing this function, largely due to Bitcoin's reliance on it.

https://preview.redd.it/p1t6rq7rpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddadf711c11df6317b747e41a541200de8fb6eab

During a leader’s slot, the PoH service will receive newly processed entries from the banking stage. The current PoH hash plus a hash of all transactions in the entry are combined into the next PoH hash. This serves as a timestamp that inserts the entry into the chain of hashes, proving the sequence in which transactions were processed. This process not only confirms the passage of time but also serves as a cryptographic record of the transactions.

In a single block, there are 800,000 hashes. The PoH stream also includes ""ticks,"" which are empty entries indicating the leader's liveness and the passage of time approximating a small fraction of a second. A tick occurs every 6.25 milliseconds, resulting in 64 ticks per block and a total block time of 400 milliseconds.

Validators continually run the PoH clock even when they are not the leader as it plays a pivotal role in the process of synchronization between nodes.

# Remember

*The key benefit of PoH is that it ensures the correct leader schedule must be adhered to, even if a block producer is offline — a state known as being “delinquent”. PoH prevents a malicious validator from producing blocks before their turn.*

# Accounts Model

*“Separating code and state in SVM was the best design decision. Blessed are the embedded system devs that religiously drilled this concept into my brain.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Within a Solana validator, the global state is maintained in the accounts database known as AccountsDB. This database is responsible for storing all accounts, both in memory and on disk. The primary data structure in the account index is a hashmap, making AccountsDB essentially a vast [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database). Here, the key is the account address, and the value is the account data.

‍Over time the number of Solana accounts has surged into the hundreds of millions. This large number is partly because, as Solana developers are fond of saying, ""Everything on Solana is an account!""

https://preview.redd.it/od9jdizvpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad934df81448f583fc49d29e7306cef5a4dc505

# Solana accounts

‍An account is a container that persistently holds data, similar to a file on a computer. They come in various forms:

‍User accounts: These accounts have a private key and are typically generated by a wallet software for a user.

* Data accounts: These accounts store state information, such as the number of a specific token a user holds.
* Program accounts: These are larger accounts that contain executable bytecode, somewhat equivalent to a .exe file on Windows or a .app file on Mac.
* Native program accounts: These are special pre-deployed program accounts that perform various core functionalities of the network. [Examples](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/programs) include the Vote Program and the BPF Loader.

‍All accounts have the following fields:

https://preview.redd.it/ek1vnit0qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c085da69525391de492cb3eb50db8d3fea40a330

# Programs

Solana program accounts contain only executable logic. This means when a program is run it mutates the state of other accounts but remains unchanged itself. This separation of code and state differentiates Solana from other blockchains and supports many of its optimizations. Developers primarily write these programs in Rust, a general-purpose programming language [known](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf) for its strong focus on safety and performance. Additionally, multiple SDKs in [TypeScript](https://www.helius.dev/blog/build-solana-programs-with-typescript-poseidon) and Python are available to facilitate the creation of application front-ends and enable programmatic interaction with the network.

‍Many common functionalities are provided out-of-the-box by native programs. For example, Solana does not require developers to deploy code to create a token. Instead, instructions are sent to a pre-deployed native program that will set up an account to store the token’s metadata, effectively creating a new token.

# ‍Rent

‍Rent is a mechanism designed to incentivize users to close accounts and reduce state bloat. To create a new account, a minimum balance of SOL, known as the ""rent-exempt"" amount, must be held by the account. This can be considered a storage cost incurred to keep the account alive in a validator's memory. If the size of the account's data increases, the minimum balance rent requirement increases proportionally. When an account is no longer needed, it can be closed, and the rent is returned to the account owner. 

‍For example, if a user holds a dollar-denominated stablecoin, this state is stored in a token account. Currently, the rent-exempt amount for a token account is 0.002 SOL. If the user transfers their entire stablecoin balance to a friend, the token account can be closed, and the user will receive back their 0.002 SOL. Programs often handle account closures automatically for users. Several applications are available to help users clean up old, unused accounts and reclaim the small amounts of SOL stored in them.

# ‍Ownership

‍While reading account data is universally permitted, Solana's ownership model enhances security by restricting exactly who can modify (write) an account's data. This concept is crucial for enforcing rules and permissions on the Solana blockchain. Every account has a program ""owner"". The owner of an account is responsible for governing it, ensuring that only authorized programs can change the account's data. A notable exception to this rule is the transfer of lamports (the smallest unit of SOL)—increasing an account's lamports balance is universally permitted, regardless of ownership.

# ‍Storage of State

‍Solana programs, being read-only executable files, must store state using “Program Derived Addresses” (PDAs). PDAs are special types of accounts associated with and owned by a program rather than a specific user. While normal Solana user addresses are derived from the public key of an Ed25519 key pair, PDAs do not have a private key. Instead, their public key is derived from a combination of parameters—often keywords or other account addresses—along with the program ID (address) of the owning program.

‍PDA addresses exist ""off-curve,"" meaning they are not on the Ed25519 curve like normal addresses. Only the program that owns the PDA can programmatically generate signatures for it, ensuring that it’s the only one that can modify the PDA's state.

https://preview.redd.it/82dag167qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5e5694b996bf17c3928282a7cf37dfb104b75e

Above: Solana token accounts are specific examples of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). They are used to hold tokens and live “off-curve.” The Associated Token Account (ATA) program ensures that each wallet can only have one associated token account for each token type, providing a standardized way to manage token accounts.

# ‍Turbine

*“The most interesting part about Solana is not parallelization, the SVM, or Toly's tweets. It is something you probably haven't heard of: Turbine.” — Mert Mumtaz, Helius*

During the banking stage, transactions are organized into entries and sent to the Proof of History stream for timestamping. The block's bank is updated, and the entries are now ready for the next phase—Turbine.

Turbine is the process through which the leader propagates their block to the rest of the network. Inspired by [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), it is designed to be fast and efficient, reducing communication overhead and minimizing the amount of data a leader needs to send.

https://preview.redd.it/t9ijgbvaqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c0ee8a717f6c145ad661e1855ec49a38917e9f

Turbine achieves this by breaking down transaction data into ""shreds'' through a process called ""shredding."" Shreds are small packets of data, up to 1280 bytes, similar to individual frames in a video stream. When reassembled, these shreds allow validators to replay the entire block. The shreds are sent over the internet between validators using UDP and utilize erasure coding to handle packet loss or malicious dropping of packets. [Erasure coding](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/reedsolomon/reed_solomon_codes.html#), a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)\-based error detection and correction scheme, ensures data integrity. Even if some shreds are lost, the block can still be reconstructed.

Shreds are grouped into batches known as forward error correction (FEC) batches. By default, these batches consist of 64 shreds (32 data shreds + 32 recovery shreds). Data recovery occurs per FEC batch, meaning that up to half the packets in a batch can be lost or corrupted, and all the data can still be recovered. Each 64 shred batch is merkelized with the root being signed by the leader, and chained to the previous batch. This process ensures that shreds can be securely obtained from any node in the network that possesses them, as the chain of Merkle roots provides a verifiable path of authenticity and integrity.

The leader initially broadcasts to a single root node, which disseminates the shreds to all other validator nodes. This root node changes with each shred. Validators are organized into layers, forming the ""Turbine Tree."" Validators with a larger stake amount are typically positioned toward the top of the tree, while those with lower stakes are placed toward the bottom.

The tree usually spans two or three hops, depending on the number of active validators. For visual simplicity, a fanout of 3 is depicted above, but Solana’s actual fanout value is currently set to 200. For security reasons, the order of the tree is rotated for each new batch of shreds.

The primary goal of such a system is to alleviate the outbound data egress pressure on the leader and root nodes. By utilizing a system of transmit and retransmit, the load is distributed between the leader and the retransmitters, reducing the strain on any single node.

Once a validator receives a new block from the leader via Turbine, it must validate all transactions within each entry. This involves replaying the entire block, validating the PoH hashes in parallel, recreating the transactions in the sequence dictated by PoH, and updating its local bank. 

[**https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png**](https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png)

This process is handled by the Transaction Validation Unit (TVU), which is analogous to the leader’s Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), serving as the core logic responsible for processing shreds and block validation. Like the TPU, the TVU flow is broken down into several stages, starting with the Shred Fetch Stage where shreds are received over Turbine. In the subsequent Shred Verify Leader Signature Stage, the shreds undergo multiple sanity checks, most notably the verification of the leader’s signature, which ensures that the received shreds originated from the leader. 

‍In the Retransmit Stage, the validator, based on its location in the Turbine tree, forwards the shreds to the appropriate downstream validators. In the Replay Stage, the validator recreates each transaction exactly and in the correct order while updating its local version of the bank.

‍The Replay Stage is analogous to the banking stage in the TPU; it is the most important stage and can be more directly described as the block validation stage. Replay is a single-threaded process loop that orchestrates many key operations, including voting, resetting the PoH clock, and switching banks.

When you ignore life’s alarms, it will only make them louder until you wake up. I am awake now. But I will sleep well tonight! Thank you all!

I’m not asking for help I just want to share my story.

I’m a hardworking mother of two, juggling work, studies, and life, doing everything I can to make it all work. Like many, I came to crypto with a dream- a dream of making good money to give my kids the childhood I never had.
But instead, I lost it all. I got rugged multiple times, poured countless sleepless nights into communities, and chased the promise of a better life. Looking back, I realize that chasing that dream cost me the very life I was trying to build for my kids. If I could go back, I’d put everything I had into paying off my loan and living a simple, carefree life.

Now, I’m back to where I started - living paycheck to paycheck and facing the reality of paying off that loan for the next ten years. Memecoins didn’t just take my money, they took time - time I can never get back with my family. All I can do now is hug my kids and leave this nightmare behind.

I did my own research, but it came at a heavy price.

The Solana Winternitz Vault is optional, meaning Solana users will need to choose to store their funds in the Winternitz vaults to be quantum-proof.

https://preview.redd.it/gg4ex0nst6be1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=efdc8a8977741b523d8e242268c43b4713cabf38

Solana developers have created a quantum-resistant vault on the Solana blockchain to protect user funds from potential threats posed by quantum computers.

The “Solana Winternitz Vault” solution achieves this by implementing a complex hash-based signature system that generates new keys every time a transaction is made, [explained ](https://github.com/deanmlittle/solana-winternitz-vault)cryptography researcher and Zeus Network chief scientist Dean Little in a Jan. 3 GitHub post.

Generating new private keys for each transaction should make it more difficult for [quantum computers](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-vs-quantum-computing-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-cryptocurrencies) to plan a coordinated attack on any given set of public keys, which are exposed each time a transaction is signed.

*Source:* [*Dean Little*](https://x.com/deanmlittle/status/1875136565456109891)

The Solana quantum-resistant feature is currently available as an optional addition, not a network-wide security upgrade. This means that Solana users must choose to store their funds in the Winternitz vaults, rather than their regular Solana wallets, to ensure their assets are protected against potential [quantum threats.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/zero-knowledge-proofs-quantum-proof-ethereum-xin-xin-fan)

# How it works

The Winternitz vault first generates a new Winternitz keypair and computes the Keccak256 Merkle root of the public key.

A “split” vault consisting of a split and refund account is then created, where the user generates a Winternitz signature over a message containing the amount of “lamports” — the smallest denomination of the native cryptocurrency Solana — that they want to transfer.

Once the transfer is completed, any remaining funds are transferred to the refund account and the vault is closed.

***Related:*** [***Don't be afraid of quantum computers***](https://cointelegraph.com/news/i-m-not-afraid-of-quantum-computers)

The development could offer a degree of reassurance to many crypto investors who fear their cryptographically secured funds could one day be wiped out by an overpowering quantum computer.

Little seemingly poked fun at Bitcoin investor and commentator Fred Krueger, by sharing [screenshots](https://x.com/deanmlittle/status/1875252002160308634) from a Dec. 19 X post in which Krueger said Solana would be the “first casualty” of quantum.

Part of [Ethereum’s technical roadmap](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-the-splurge-advanced-cryptography-plan-for-quantum-computers) includes implementing quantum-resistant solutions — however, one of Ethereum’s founders, Vitalik Buterin, is confident that quantum won’t [pose any real threat](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-bitcoin-encryption-keys) for at least a decade.

“Even if ‘real’ quantum computers come soon, the day when regular people have quantum computers on their laptops or phones may well be decades after the day when powerful institutions get one that can crack elliptic curve cryptography,” Buterin said in October.

It all started from one of my token from GMGN (same applies to Dexscreener). As I review the graph as I usually do, I decided to visit again its X account to check for any news. Unfortunately, the X link has been changed to a malicious X account and I did not notice this. On the malicious X account was a post that news and discussion about the project will be discussed on the telegram group so I joined the tg group as I normally would.

During the joining process, there's the usual verify if your human popup from Safeguard to prevent bots from joining. I clicked this and everything looks normal, except for an extra step that I have to scan a QR code. I don't recall doing this with other tg group but it seems like a normal 2FA checking so I scanned it. And that's where I fucked up.

At first, nothing is happening, it only looks like the QR that i'm scanning is not working, so I kept on scanning it and trying to align the camera and lighting to get it right. Then I noticed something on my active chats, my Solana Trojan Bot, which I haven't used in a long time had a chat notification. I checked the message and it sent me my private key. I was wondering why, and read that the message requesting it came from me just seconds ago.

Right it that moment, I realized what happened and I triggered a logout on all devices from the tg app on my phone. Then a ""Token-Admin"" started chatting me, saying they can see that I that I'm having some problems joining the group. I blocked this person, and another one sent me a message. Told them to fuck off and they stopped, and left all tg groups.

I was lucky that my solana tg trading bot doesn't have any funds as I stopped using it long ago. So I removed it from the wallets, and moved all other funds to new wallets, just to be sure.

Posting this to share awareness that it's so easy to get hacked nowadays. You could be doing something you normally do multiple times a day, and still get hacked. Always double check everything on every step, and for the love of god, don't scan any QR code on telegram.

My experience:

I just wanted to share my experience with Solcard. It was the first time that I used Solcard (a decentralized debit/credit card on Solana ecosystem) and it worked! 

I was skeptical in the beginning because I was involved very early and thought it was just another meme coin. I thought it could be another rug pull or scam but I eventually decided to take a chance and give it a shot.

I ordered something small off Amazon to test it out and the transaction went through and arrived at my door step that same week.

My thoughts: 

As of 2017, approximately 1.7 billion adults worldwide were unbanked, meaning they did not have access to a bank account.  This represented about 31% of the global adult population at that time.

Regarding mobile phone ownership among the unbanked, data from 2013 indicated that nearly 70% of unbanked individuals owned a mobile phone.

I think this could solve major problems for certain parts of the world. And came to the realization how much it already does through conversations with people in the community

When you click a Telegram link, you'll usually be brought to a Portal channel, which serves as an entrance to the chat room/group. 

Portal channels typically have with a button that says ""Tap to Verify"", and verifying will allow you to enter the group. But bad actors have created fake portal channels, and they'll add the fake links to Dexscreener by paying the cost. 

When you click Tap to Verify you'll be brought to screen where you press Start. **Here, check the username of the bot you're talking to.**

It should say @Safeguard *exactly,* well, I believe it actually says ""@Safeguard also @SafeguardRobot"", but if it's anything different than that, don't click. 

There are other portals besides Safeguard, but Safeguard is the biggest and the only one people are bothering to spoof right now.

If you click you the fake bot's tap to verify, don't fret, it can't hurt you yet. The fake portal bots will try to force you to to download or install an extension or add on. Just don't do that. That's what will fuck you.

If you do do that, immediately set up 2FA for your account or change your pw if you already have it set up.

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept 3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

A few questions I have about staking and cold wallet.  
I know most people here likes to stake in Rocketpool because of decentralization.

1. Why must one convert from ETH to rETH to stake? why can't we just stake ETH?

2. How do I safely stake my ETH directly from my cold wallet?

3. Won't there be depegging from ETH to rETH?

4. I know there are risks, but what are the chances of my funds being lost in Rocketpool?",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,"""Vitalik Buterin Deserves a Nobel Prize in Economics for His Work on Crypto and Ethereum."": Bankless Co-Founder Ryan Sean Adams",2025-01-03 14:32:32,"In a tweet Ryan Sean Adams - co-founder of Bankless - said that Vitalik Buterin should be recognized with a Nobel prize in economics for his contributions to Ethereum and the entire crypto space. He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

I wonder if one day Vitalik will be remembered as one of the greatest economic innovators of our time",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

Please ask any questions you may have!  We have our next public goods funding round beginning January 11th.  To learn more about Octant, join our discord: [https://discord.com/invite/octant](https://discord.com/invite/octant) ",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
Reddit,ethereum,Calculating network fee,2025-01-03 10:06:41,"Can anyone please tell me how to reliably calculate the network fee at any given time?

I've used etherscan gas tracker and used the current gwei to calculate the price, but it is out by a factor of 100 from what I am quoted by CoinBase.

21000 \* 8 = 168000 = 0.000168 ETH = £0.49

CB total cost = £40 / £20 of this is network fee

I simply just do not understand how to calculate this fee or the total cost and CoinBase aren't much help.

Reddit,ethereum,The Next Upgrade and Global Adoption 2025,2025-01-02 05:29:45,"##**Tech and upgrades coming in 2025**

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

\- gasless transactions / gas sponsoring: the user could pay in another token like USDC.

\- transactions budling

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

I am no crypto expert, can anyone here help me  find my money ?

Ps : wrote to revolut, they said they don’t know where is the money, and that they are looking

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,Starting My Journey with Smart Contracts ,2024-12-29 21:07:13,"Hey everyone,

I’m just getting started with learning about smart contracts, and honestly, I’m pretty excited (and a little overwhelmed). Ethereum has always fascinated me, and I finally decided it’s time to stop just reading about it and actually start building something.

I’ve been messing around with Solidity and doing some tutorials to get a feel for how everything works. My goal is to eventually create my own project—something small and manageable for now, but hopefully useful or at least a good learning experience.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

I’m looking forward to learning from this community and (fingers crossed) sharing something cool soon!",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,ethereum,Those living in Canada: Do you save up in USDC?,2024-12-28 18:33:37,"Hi!

With the decline of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, are you considering creating your emergency fund in USD?
For sure, you can open an USD account in a traditional bank but do you also consider buying USDC (or other tokens)?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to have a discussion regarding **how relevant (or nor) is it to save up in USDC for a Canadian.** I know a lot of Canadians are already investing in USD anyway.
**Does saving up directly on a USD stablecoin make any sense?**


How I see it:

**Advantages**
- less fees (maybe not, I really don't know what are the fees for a USD account opened in Canada)
- easy to buy 

**Disadvantages**
- **taxes implications?** If you pay your transaction fees in ETH, technically you may have to pay taxes on it (depending on your ACB). Plus, since ERC-20 tokens are considered assets in Canada, you should pay taxes if you make a gain when you spend your USDC (*if USD(C)/CAD goes up in value across time, which is the current consensus*)
- **not easy to spend USD** outside of Crypto space (but crypto cards are democratizing)",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to run a state only node ?,2024-12-28 12:11:33,"Hey,

I'm not really sure how different Ethereum is from Bitcoin in client logic. From my understanding, there are transactions and state (smart contract values, etc...).

In my case, I need to access the read-only features of some smart contracts without spending too much on hardware. 

My current solution was to use an rpc provider, request the state of contract x, then listen for new blocks and update the state on my end based on the transactions received. This is necessary to avoid hitting rate limits, as my usage uses a large number of requests.

The problem is that the ""sync"" part can take days with the current rate limit because I'm using contract calls, which probably isn't the best solution. So I wanted to know if it was possible to run a node without the whole blockchain, just with the state, the goal is not to verify transactions but to know more efficiently the state of specific contracts.

Do you know if this is possible? if not, is it difficult to create my own implementation to request this directly on the network like real nodes do, and include my logic instead?

A kind of ethereum client that  sync only a specific part of the state and does not store or verify transactions",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
Reddit,ethereum,Can somebody explain how people are still paying $23 or over that for gas fees in the second half of 2024?,2024-12-27 17:18:42,"Hi. I was just following an ETH thread in the cryptocurrency subreddit and various people are claiming they are paying about $30 or even more than that for their gas fees for L1 transactions.

For example, [I saw this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hm4k11/comment/m3tigd0/
):

> Yeah I try to swap $45 worth of ETH for a coin I want and it's costing me $23 gas fees. No thanks. 

I have read other comments in the past few weeks of people still paying something like upper $20 range for gas fees, and I assume their transactions were recently?

How is this possible though?  Checking the gas fee chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#1y, the highest average gas fee in the last 6 months was $14 USD on November 13th.  The gas fee has generally been lower than that in the last 6 months for Ethereum.

I haven't seen any average gas fee over $20 USD since March of 2024 according to that chart.  So how are people still paying like $23, or even in the upper $20 range for their gas fees lately?",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,ethereum,Beginner confused about networks,2024-12-26 11:16:47,"Hi all, 

I’m fairly new to crypto and find the networks quite overwhelming. 

I can choose from Ethereum (ERC20), Optimism, Arbitrum One, or Base network. 

Unfortunately I do not know the difference between these - all I know, is I don’t want to pay the exorbitant fees from the ERC20 network. 

Can I just randomly choose the same low fee network on my sending and receiving end, or is there a process to using other networks, e.g., buying supporting coins for a transaction? 

I also noticed the differing networks have their own amount of eth storage. If you send eth using a specific network, it’ll stay on that network forever? You can never combine all your eth? 

Are there any negatives of using different networks to avoid exorbitant fees?

As you can see, I’m quite confused, any help would be much appreciated!!

Thanks ",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
Reddit,ethereum,Looking for a library of known ETH addresses (like ones owned by exchanges etc),2024-12-26 11:24:01,"Hey all,  
My brother has discovered that his Edge wallet has been completely emptied.   
A few hours after he deposited his ETH (in 2021), they were all transferred to an unknown address.  
The address is 0x3c681f08353c39c0fcea3a04a56f381796bce7e8  
And according to its history it may be an exchange deposit wallet. It has transacted a total volume of $128M, which looks organizational to say the least. 

I'm now trying to understand if I can associate this address with a known entity and investigate further.   
Does anyone have an idea where to look?

Thanks!",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](http://cryptache.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Bitcoin-Standard-The-Decentralized-Alternative-to-Central-Banking-PDF-Room.pdf)

MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Buying Bitcoin is cheaper for americans.,2025-01-06 17:16:51,"Americans don't realize how much money they spare just by buying Bitcoin in american dollar.

Let me give you a example:
Most of us buy Bitcoin through a Exchange.
When you buy Bitcoin there, there is a fee for buying, and there is a fee for sending to your hot/cold wallet.

If a American earns $1.200 per month, and buy $200 dollars in BTC, the fee for sending it to the hot/cold wallet is minimum. Something like 20 - 50 dollars?

I'm not a American citizen, that means that my currency is worth less than the U.S dollar. (Currently being US$ 1,00 = R$ 6,00 my currency is Real, Brazil).

That means that if I want to buy or send my BTC to my wallet, it is multiplied by 6. Which is currently R$120 - R$150.

By the way, I make R$1,600 per month, so R$150 is roughly 10% of my salary.

It's extremely difficult to stack even 1 cent (0.01) of Bitcoin.

So Americans, or Europeans of this sub, enjoy your strong economy and buy sats, because here in the third world, where I live and I'm currently fighting for a better life, it's hard to stack Bitcoin safely.

I think it’s a great tool to save money and negate the loss of dollar purchasing power. It’s the S&P500 on steroids, where the biggest holders will continue to generate insane amounts of wealth , borrow against it while the rest scramble for crumbs or are forced to sell to pay for living expenses. I’m happy to be in on it, happy for those here avoiding loss of purchase power, just concerned for the general concept of a sped up wealth gap generator and its effects on society long term. Bitcoin and the stock market are a scary indicator that the western world economic dominance is facing a problem, which owning some shares/coins will help mitigate, but it’s worrisome to think what it means in a macroeconomic environment. 

The death of efficient wealth redistribution by governments which are no longer capable of doing so continues to drive a gap between the haves and have nots. I’m worried bitcoin will just be abused as a way to further that gap (see MSTR money printing/bitcoin buying hack). What’s the end game look like for the 90%? ",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

2. The dangers of government overreach and programmable money.
3. Why does the current system leave billions behind, and what comes next?

I’m working on something called Roxom TV—a 24/7 live channel (you can find us in YouTube or X @roxomtv) all about Bitcoin and crypto news. Think Bloomberg meets MTV, but fully focused on Bitcoin. We’re serious when it matters, but we also want it to be fun, engaging, and way more entertaining than the usual financial stuff.

Our goal is to create something that’s actually exciting to watch, not just for Bitcoin pros but for anyone curious about this space.

Here’s where you come in: If you could create the perfect show or segment for a Bitcoin live stream, what would it be? Maybe something you’ve always wanted to see, something you think is missing in crypto media, or even just a crazy idea that could make it more fun.

If you had the chance to tune into a channel like this, what’s the one program that would keep you watching?

My investment cake is built on a base of stock index funds - mainly S&P 500 index fund  VOO and Nasdaq 100 index fund QQQ.

That’s 80% of the portfolio. 10% in cash and bonds (old habits die hard 😂).

Bitcoin is the turbocharged icing on this cake. 10% of my portfolio, already 11% on a good day like today, likely going to 20% soon as BTC icing appreciates faster than the index fund base.

The icing makes the cake look nice and exciting. The icing tastes great especially in a bull market.

Worst case, if all the icing goes away, it will hurt, but the cake will still stand.

Am I thinking correctly or am I deluded? When does the icing and cake intermingle and become inseparable?

CEO Simon Gerovich says Metaplanet will expand its BTC holdings by ""utilizing the most accretive capital market tools available.""

In my region, it is customary to give large gifts for Catholic confirmation (when they are around 14 years old) and I wanted to give them the fund on that day.

Today I have decided to sell these funds and convert them into crypto. I've been in the crypto game for a long time (even though I'm annoyed today that I didn't collect whole Bitcoin when I still had the chance), so a gift like this from their nerdy uncle makes more sense.

**So each nephew will receive a Keystone tablet at their respective Holy Confirmation.**  
**Behind each seed is 0.02 BTC.**

I know that the system is not entirely fair, the younger nephew has been saved less so far and should therefore find less on his tablet, but I simply found these numbers (and two decimal places for BTC) more aesthetic.

One advantage is that I no longer have to save in a fund for my nephews and my nephews' assets are no longer lying around in my mixed custody account, but slumbering in sealed metal plates.

We still have four and six years before my nephews will receive their seeds. I'm very curious to see how their value will develop.",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

If I do not rebalance, and keep DCA buying both Bitcoin and stock index funds, when will Bitcoin become the dominant portion of my portfolio (I.e., exceed 50%)?",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,bitcoin,Is it safe to update the ledger OS?,2025-01-06 23:29:15,"Hi all,

I have been using the ledger and ledger live as the software. But from time to time, there is a notification on the ledger live asking me to update the ledger OS, and because need to connect to ledger to do so, I am always reluctant upgrade the device OS. I am not making any transactions why I connect to my ledger? What if somehow I connect my ledger and my secret key is stolen?

https://preview.redd.it/e7mca5xljgbe1.png?width=3402&format=png&auto=webp&s=9db736df71173dcbdb7a1958f2ac3e3dc6294e56

Another thing is I heard ledger have key recovery feature, I don't want to give away the key control to anyone else because I can't trust ledger. I am afraid if I upgrade to latest system, the feature is enabled automatically and ledger get my key.



So questions would be:

1. Is upgrading OS always safe and recommended as long as the notification is from the official Ledger Live?
2. What's the issue if I don't upgrade? Can I continue to make transaction? If I don't make transactions in the short time, can I just not upgrade it at all?
3. What do you think of the ledger recovery feature? Are you really enabling and using it?

I'm new to buying Bitcoin and have been trying my best to do some research. I was going to buy a Trezor Safe 3 and keep my Bitcoin on there. I would like to check my account balance on my Android phone and desktop. Is Trezor Suite Lite suitable on Android? I see that it's only got 2.5 stars on the Play Store and there's a lot of 1 star reviews. Due to this I was thinking of using the Blockstream Green app instead - would it matter if I used a different app, or is the Trezor app completely fine for what I'd use it for? I'm really new to this so please bare with. What I wanted to do is buy Bitcoin on Kraken and then send to my cold wallet and then I could check my balance on the go. I don't think this makes it a hot wallet...but I'm not sure. Any help is much appreciated 🙏",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Requirements:

1) We usually transact on a weekly basis so very complex setups will not work.
2) All partners are also NOT geographically close, so setup and transactions need to be able to happen remotely.
3) Would prefer not to use hardware wallets and use easy to use wallets such as BlueWallet.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,[SERIOUS] Question: Why is no one fighting for decnetralization of  crypto?,2025-01-07 00:25:31,"This is not a long and profound question.

  
It's just a simple one.

  
Crypto was supposed to be people taking the power back from the government and banks, who've misused their power to control and manipulate the finances of the average Joe for centrues now.   

  
Why are people not banding to take control of a new era where people have control over the money and self-accountability for stupidity (ie: bad investment where you had to click 'ok' to buy) 

It feels like this went from encouraging a healthier mankind to now, we're about to get stuck with a big one, even worse.   People like Coinbase are already showing people they can take their money without impunity.....   I am personally scared to put money on that exchange after they held my funds twice & require you give up your privacy or they keep your money. 

It's really crazy.  

Should there not be a major crypto lobby?",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Pullpush.io collects all your Reddit data whether you've agreed to it or not - If you've ever once talked about Cryptocurrency they will refuse to remove you from their database.,2025-01-06 15:43:00,"You may or may know this or not, but pullpush.io is a service that collects all your reddit data and sells it to big data, whether or not you opted into it or not. 

If you've ever *once* talked about Cryptocurrency on your reddit account in your life, pushpull.io will refuse your right to privacy, which includes violating the laws of the country you live in. If you are in Europe, this includes [the right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten).

If you submit a removal request, you will be given an extremely rude and condescending reply, by an ""admin"" who acts like a 13 year old child who's read one too many Forbes articles on how Cryptocurrency is a scam, and be told that ever talking about Cryptocurrency means you are a scammer.

If you ask them to follow the laws in your country, [you will be mocked](https://i.imgur.com/7svTwGE.png) and told that you're not in Kansas, and that *""I know you get money from the state if your lazy ass can't find a job, but you aren't in Kansas anymore, we owe you exactly nothing.""*

If you are a moderator who wants to opt out of data collection, they will tell you that you need to sticky a thread for 3 days on every single subreddit you moderate saying that you're opting out like some sort of shame bell, and told that [it's because Reddit moderators are all paedophiles](https://forum.pullpush.io/d/38-why-reddit-mods-need-to-declare-their-intent-to-opt-out-to-their-subreddits) and told that *""No, you aren't a special snowflake, you should have thought of that before you started hanging out with a bunch of paedophiles.""*

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now, since the administrator of a huge data collecting site is apparently a teenage edgelord, doesn't actually read tickets and doesn't actually care about any of your privacy rights, here's what you can do if you've ever once talked about Crypto and are worried about your privacy online like a regular human would be.

You can also use the greasyfork script here:

https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1870-delete-all-reddit-comments/code

You can also download redact:

https://redact.dev/services/reddit

As always with any links, please check and verify before using and installing. These services will NOT remove your comments from pushpull but they will keep you safe in other circumstances if you for any reason posted doxxable or personally identifying information.

As well, **never** talk about anything online that can be traced to you as a person as there are a ton of shady services that are tracking it all whether you know about it or not like pushpull.io that unlike google and other reputable services will continue to do it whether you ask them to nicely or not.

https://np.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/10yj803/removal_request_form_please_put_your_removal/

You can try your luck here but be aware you will likely get a snarky response from a terminally online child instead of your data being opted out.


Since Cryptocurrency is a high risk investment, please be careful with your online security and make sure you are safe online. There's been multiple stories of people who flaunt their wealth or talk about their holdings who have been attacked, kidnapped, or held ransom, don't end up being one of those people, and don't let shady sites stop you from being safe with how you comment on Reddit.",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why Aren't Steady Gains More Appealing in Crypto Copy Trading?,2025-01-07 09:24:48,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been running a well-backtested algo for copy trading on Bybit. It’s designed to survive hard crashes and bear markets while delivering steady, consistent gains. Of course, this means it doesn’t outperform most of the market during strong bull runs due to its very safe setup. However, it really shines when the market turns ""bad.""

For example, a backtest from **2020-06-01 to 2022-12-28** (last bull run through mid-bear) showed:

* **Max unclosed drawdown:** \~20%
* **Closed losses:** \~5%
* **Win rate:** \>90%

Even during rough months when most traders struggled, the algo came out ahead.

Here’s the issue: I’ve noticed that many crypto traders seem uninterested in steady, low-risk gains. Some followers left my copy trades because the gains were “too slow,” but then the moment they saw a 5% drawdown, they left because of “risk.” It feels like there’s this obsession with high-risk moonshots, even though those same rewards can be wiped out quickly by the risks.

I personally prefer slow, steady growth with minimal risk over taking chances on liquidation for potential high rewards. Am I alone in thinking this?

So, I’m curious:

* For those of you trading or copy trading crypto, what do you actually want out of a strategy?
* Are you more interested in slow, steady growth or high-risk, high-reward plays?
* What features or metrics would make you trust and stick with a copy trading strategy?

Let me know your thoughts—I’m open to any feedback or questions about the algo or how it works!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Is the US creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve factored into the price of BTC? No. ,2025-01-06 17:07:47,">""The market is an imperfect forward pricing mechanism.""  
u/nanooverbtc

Is BTC near it's top or will it keep climbing this year. It's an important question with lots of money on the line across all of crypto. If Bitcoin is at the top and only tumbles from here alts will see a bloodbath if Bitcoin has room to climb alts will be lifted and some might be able to make gains against BTC from Alt specific catalysts. 

So with the context of us all having money on the line lets try to answer the question, ""***Is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve factored into the price?""***

***TLDR: NO***

***----***

***What*** **is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?**

A strategic Bitcoin Reserve as introduced by Cynthia Lummis would see the US Government purchase 1M Bitcoin, \~5% of the total Bitcoin Supply over a number of years. [source](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-introduces-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-legislation/)

When Trump first uttered support for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference the price of BTC was \~$68K.

Although the price of Bitcoin was largely sideways until November 7th  as the markets were largely unsure if Trump would be elected and have a chance to implement his plan the price of BTC today sits at $102K, up $34K or +50% since then.

\----

**So is it already factored into the price of Bitcoin?**

The simple answer is no as Trump has a Loooooong history of lying and not fulfilling promises the market overall expects the US not to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in 2025, so despite this being a promise of his campaign and the market having partially priced it in, it is not fully priced in.

Source: Although I have a history of pointing out Polymarket and their shady markets resolves I am going to reference their market ""US National Bitcoin Reserve in 2025?""

Which sits at only 40% as evidence that the current price of Bitcoin hasn't fully priced in a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. After all how can something be priced in when people think there is less than a 2/5th chance of it actually happening.

\---

**Baseless price predictions based off change in BTC price since July 2024 strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement.**

I'm not going to claim this is an accurate prediction but if the price of Bitcoin increased 50% on 40% odds, it actually happening and being fully priced in (+60% odds) would be a 75% increase in BTC or  \~$178K BTC.

**Again this is baseless price predictions looking at only one thing and baselessly extrapolating. But the fact remains a US National Bitcoin Reserve (happening) is not yet priced in to the price of BTC.**",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why aren't people investing in OriginTrail (Trac)?,2025-01-06 20:54:50,"The project is currently sitting at around 200th place in market cap depending where you look with a max total supply of 500 million tokens. All tokens in circulation. 70 million are TVL in nodes that are running on the network.

I'll be first to admit that I've been aware of this project for years as it is an OG project from 2017(?) or something, but it never really clicked with me for several reasons. One main factor being that utility tokens tend to require low cost for anyone to want to use them. Which has been the case here for many years hence why I wasn't as hyped as some of the people promoting this project.

Well, fast forward to this Christmas and I randomly decided to revisit this project to see how things were going. Since I first learned about this project in 2021 things seemed to move in the right direction albeit slow. Real businesses were using the technology, big names were involved in it, British Standard Institute were adamant in applying OriginTrail to everything. Looked very promising but the demand for the token was lackluster mostly due to network limits.

I'll save everyone a long read and direct you simply to the official network statistics website for OriginTrail:

[https://staking.origintrail.io/](https://staking.origintrail.io/)

The hockey stick increase that began 2 weeks ago in activity can be seen on the right chart. While Trac demand is on the left and is currently sitting at about 65-70,000 Trac per day. These tokens are being locked in nodes as payment to nodes as businesses upload data/hash it by creating something called ""knowledge assets"". All business demand, not random people or fake token lock-ups! After the upgrade to DKG v8, or Decentralized Knowledge Graph version 8, which apparently will boost 1000x increase in network capabilities a whole new dimension has opened up and is apparently in its infancy stage for global adoption.

I have personally started to stack up here, just curious why no one is paying attention? The adoption stage seem to be starting and businesses seem to be lined up to use this technology. It has basically opened up ability for any business, small or large, to build their own Knowledge Graphs, in a decentralized way.

Give me your opinions! Seems these guys have been really hard at work for 5-6 years now and things seem to be stacking up for them nicely. Token demand is directly related to businesses using the Trac token. ",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

This all smells fishy to me, but my brother is convinced that this is the best thing that's ever happened.

My last request (out of 2) is if anyone has any up to date tutorials explaining buying and owning crypto. I can youtube this but if anyone has any that they think would be particularly well made then go ahead and post it here.

I guess all I have to say now is that I still don't fully understand the need for specialized cold wallets. Maybe if you're paranoid enough sure.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Let’s Make Crypto Great Again…,2025-01-07 10:27:15,"
It’s the very tail end of January 6th and my wife just went all in on Doland Tremp ($TREMP).
She’s a first-time investor who has patiently watched the market roll up and down, listen to the rampant speculation on all sides, and be inspired by conversations of ending corruption at the highest levels of our financial institutions. And yet, she had never felt called to dive in - that is, until now.
As you all know, this timeline marks a fateful day as President Donald Trump’s victory was certified, four years after the so-called Capitol Attack. Here in America, we have survived a whole lotta BS since that time. But today, unlike elections past, we’re feeling hopeful. For the first time in our lifetime (we’re in our 30s), we feel like we have an incoming administration who are talking about real issues that critically matter to all of us - across borders - including ending the forever wars and paying off our mountain of debt by investing in crypto.
So! What better way to send a strong message to our incoming President that we see him and can’t wait for his team to propel this movement to not just the moon, but mars and beyond, than by investing in HIS meme coin?! There are 9.3 MILLION members in this group. Think about it, if everyone bought what they could afford to spare, even if it’s a dollar or two, we’d make enough of a splash to catch the attention of Wall Street and the global media. This. Could. Be. Our. GameStop. Moment.
Seriously though, could you imagine newscasters around the world having to explain what Doland Tremp is and how a lot of Redditors got rich off of it? It’s equal parts hilarious as it would be educational.
We have a unique opportunity between now and the inauguration on January 20th to ride this rocket fast and hard. Tell your friends. Tell your folks. Sign your dog up to an exchange. And of course, tag the shizzle outta Trump, Musk, RFK Jr, all of their government efficiency buds and every crypto hot shot you know because we have a solid shot at making this the GREATEST INVESTMENT OF ALL TIME.
Alright, if you’re still reading this, thanks for sticking with us this far. All that’s left to say is…

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Seedy - Advanced Seed Recovery Tool v1.0 ,2025-01-06 08:00:57,"GM ,   Im reposting this Tool here in the r/CryptoCurrency  sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery).  My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example.  It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds.  The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github.   LINK AT BOTTOM .  It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept  3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

That's for everyone who is calling the top. The most called top ever.

Last cycle I was busy playing League of Legends so I didn't experienced it, but I don't think the current market sentiment represents the euphoria that is correlated to a cycle top or a bubble burst. I mean, we're all actually pretty depressed. ",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Am I understanding staking correctly?,2025-01-06 19:43:13,"So bought my first Crypto last night *pops party popper*

I've went with 

70% Bitcoin 
20% Ethereum 
10% Alt coins (SOL, SUI, XRP)

Im already up £5 so it's all very exciting! What I've seen on the app I'm using (Kraken Pro) is on option to STAKE my Ethereum for 2.5-7%.

Struggling to find a solid answer on what this actually means so I'm going to explain it the way I understand it and someone please tell me if I'm right.

I can STAKE all 20% of my Ethereum for a period of time (maybe someone could clarify if I choose how long I want to STAKE my crypto for?) and after that period of time, I get 2.5-7% return on my 20% Ethereum? 

During that STAKING period, my crypto is no longer traded/invested and does not gain any extra value. 

The end product is I willl now have an extra 1.7 Ethereum if I had earned the 7% and this can now be traded/invested.

I also have the option for Bonded and Bonded Restaking if someone can simply what that means and what one is better or if either is more risky than the other.

Finally, is STAKING worth it? I plan on holding my crypto for a long period of time, adding to it from time to time.",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Litecoin delivers 300,000,000th transaction today after 13 years of 100% uptime.",2025-01-05 01:10:05,"It's rare to find any real fundamentals in crypto, much less long term relative growing fundamentals in a coin with bad relative price action. Litecoin is deep clucking value. It's worth digging into the transaction growth trends over the past few years. There's only one altcoin, only one dino with sustained real world user growth and adoption vs everything, even against Bitcoin. It's Litecoin.  

The nice thing about Litecoin is you can confirm onchain data using offchain data. With premined smart contracts you have two layers of deception in the data. First is outright fraud. Preminers can't sell without collapsing the mcap of their chain, but they can put coins into the contracts and just spin them around to create the illusion that there's more activity than there is. They can also use the value of the premine to temporarily support unsustainable incentives, yield farming.   

Real world adoption can be seen offchain as well as onchain, in exchanges, payment processors, retailers, banks, brokerages, atms and the like. Most coins get just enough infrastructure and struggle to add more. Litecoin has over the past few years kept pace with the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin in terms of additions, without the billionaire support, just with users. Sustained additions suggest there's ample liquidity to make it worth retaining support and adding more.  

Over the last few years, Litecoin has added Paypal, Venmo, Paxos, Verifone, bitpay, AMC, Regal, Newegg, Flexa, Gemini, Interactive Brokers, Coinshares, Wisdom Tree, Grayscale, Shopify, Moneygram, postfinance, bitgo, Wisdomtree, Coinme, EDX, Fidelity and even banks like BBVA, BanColumbia and CBA. It's first US ETF application was filed by Canary Capital late last year. That's above and beyond the table stakes of near universal exchange support.  

Among entities reporting user share, Litecoin has really excelled. Litecoin remains the top altcoin among ATMs worldwide, which you can see at coinatmradar. Litecoin has grown it's share at outlets like Coingate and Bitrefill. Most impressively, Litecoin has done at the oldest crypto payment processor what no alt has ever done and taken the top slot from Bitcoin.  

Bitpay, around since 2011, dragged its feet adding Litecoin for years adding other alts, then in 2021 it finally added LTC. It took LTC 3 months to exceed all other altcoin's share. It took maybe a year to exceed all altcoins combined. Then 2 years in it exceeded Bitcoin's share for the first time and last year exceeded Bitcoin's share the entire year, without interruption.  

Litecoin is the values compatible Medium of Transaction companion to Bitcoin's Store of Value. No other coin combines the no premine, fair distribution, algo dominant PoW, fixed supply, global network effect growth with affordable fees. You don't have to hope the centralized preminers don't rug and kill it, they can't because Litecoin shares Bitcoin's decentralization priority. You can see the substitution over the years whenever Bitcoin fees rise, so it's not my opinion, it's the opinion of Bitcoin users drawn to it for the same values. I'd encourage everyone to follow wlitecoin on Twitter/x to learn more about monetization limits and the onchain stats comparisons.  

Litecoin is the boring financial plumbing that has proven it can't be killed by sustained investor hostility, or even slowed. Negative narratives will persist until they fall apart, and the narratives don't match the adoption. 2025 could be Łit.",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,My thoughts on alt coins.,2025-01-06 17:38:21,"Like many, when I first dove into crypto years ago, I wasn't willing to put any money into BTC due to the price. At the time I was thinking that my small payments wouldn't ever amount to anything considering the minuscule fraction I'd be owning. 

But ironically, I ended up putting in several thousand dollars to alt coins that could've been put towards BTC. Furthermore, I had started buying crypto a while before the major crash a couple years ago. Meaning that I missed out big time because BTC was super low and my portfolio value had vanished.  

~~And so I'm thinking about trading all my coins for BTC while I still have some profit left since these alt coins haven't shown me gains more than a few months of work wages.~~

**Edit:** I mean claim current profits and wait for the next BTC crash to buy in cause here's the crazy thing I found out. Back in the fall of 2023, my wallet had the highest value I've ever seen with a 6k profit. Now me being a hodler I didn't want to sell for such a small gain compared to the much more I originally put in. So I held. 

But what didn't notice at that time was that BTC was around 40k meaning if I had taken my money and that 6k profit to put it into BTC then, I would've gotten almost half a coin.

And we can clearly see what it would be worth now, over a year later. Just another should've, could've, would've moment.

Not going to lie, I feel like I've been duped on the alt coin hype, the ETH to 10k, the Shiba to a penny, and the other alt's ""projects of future vision"", ""the next BTC killer"", etc.

So who's all scratching their head with me?",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Gary Gensler Will Resign as SEC Chairman in 17 Days - This Is Very Bullish for Crypto,2025-01-04 19:54:24,"As you may already know, SEC Chair Gary Gensler will resign on January 20, 2025, in 17 days. For many and maybe all crypto investors this will be a celebration day because we all probably believe that he really made a terrible job ""protecting"" US citizens and ""adopting"" crypto. This will be a big relief and it is going to bring a brighter future because the ""pro"" crypto government in US.

[Gary Gensler Crying](https://preview.redd.it/cseca9gw71be1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ececbf518e8dbabc43043acc994bf87bd90b426)

  
Gary Gensler leaving is very important for crypto because SEC acted very hard on it. You will probably still remember things like ""ETH is a security"" narrative, a lot of lawsuit against crypto companies, enforcement actions, unclear rules, etc. everything under the ""protecting citizens"" flag. Funny thing, all the FTX drama happened in front of their nose and failed again to protect citizens.

All this movements only slowed down crypto and forced many projects to move to other countries because they were scared of regulations. Even Coinbase were facing troubles.

But now, the light is coming and Gary Gensler is leaving and there is room for change. Probably the new chairman will be more open minded for crypto and embrace it in a more positive way instead of being a pain in the ass and fight innovation and the future.

This is really bullish because as you may know US is one of the countries that (for good or bad) moves the economy forward or backwards sometimes. Meaning that a pro crypto policies in US will make an statement to other countries which will probably start a race to adopt crypto ASAP to not be the last one.

This will drive more new projects, more adoption, more everything and I am not only talking about BTC treasuries, I am also talking about Ethereum ecosystem expansion and a lot of other coins evolving.

Bye Gary!

They will manipulate the crypto market.

Just watch them. I guarantee you they will keep pumping and dumping it. I bet you they will create accumulation phases, then distribution phases, and then push a dump. We'll have all these Wyckoff patterns.

And they might even go bigger than that.

They might pump and dump in long multi-year cycles on a bigger scale.

For no fundamental reason. Just because they can, and the volatility is gonna drive the price up like crazy to maximize their profit, and probably even create FOMO.

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

Reddit,crypto,Storing libsodium private keys on disk,2024-12-27 19:31:38,"Hi everyone,

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

Reddit,crypto,How to apply Pohlig Hellman using a very limited set of auxiliary inputs in that case ?,2024-11-04 15:25:21,"So I was reading about [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1321). The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-07 12:19:39.489018
