Here’s What The Charts Say,2025-02-06 00:30:10+00:00,"Dogecoin is still reeling in losses after a crazy 40% decline at the start of the week. Although it has since recovered a bit, Dogecoin is still on a 20% loss in a seven-day timeframe at the time of writing.  However, technical analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s bull run might still be in play, and the meme coin could still reach the $10 price target this cycle. This analysis is based on the time taken for Dogecoin to reach new all-time highs and market peaks in the previous cycles. Dogecoin’s Historical Cycles and Price Peaks Dogecoin’s price movements have historically followed well-defined cycles, and multiple analysts have observed a consistent pattern across the cycles. Notably, Dogecoin is now in its third market cycle, and price dynamics in the current cycle have already shown different repetition signs from the two previous cycles.  Related Reading: Can The Dogecoin Price Rally For 3 Months Straight? 2021 Bull Market Performance Says Yes According to crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL (@DimaPotts36), Dogecoin’s price history has a striking cycle pattern that repeats approximately every 1,442 days. This pattern of 1,442 days is the average time taken for the Dogecoin price to reach its final peak of each cycle when counting from the bear market low.  The first cycle, which spanned between 2013 and 2018, saw DOGE rally by 21,821% from its cycle low to its peak. Back then, Dogecoin was trading for a minuscule price around $0.00009, but it eventually surged to break above $0.01 for the first time. At that time, Dogecoin was still regarded as little more than a joke coin, with only speculative trading from early investors driving its price action.  The bear market low was recorded at $0.00125, but as the crypto market entered a euphoric bull phase in 2021, Dogecoin became one of the biggest winners of the meme coin craze, as it went on a 54,890% increase from its cycle low. The meme coin craze allowed Dogecoin to gain prominence among retail traders during this period, which eventually pushed its price to the current all-time high of $0.7316. With the third cycle now in motion, crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL noted that it might take the same 1,422 days for Dogecoin to reach a new peak. Timeline For New Dogecoin Price Peak Dogecoin’s current market cycle began immediately after its all-time high in 2021, after which the meme coin entered a prolonged bear market. The price low for this cycle was registered sometime in 2022 when Dogecoin corrected to as low as $0.055. Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Play As Price Gears Up For Another 600% Run Above $2 A repeat of the 1442-day cycle means that Dogecoin will reach its market peak on April 14, 2025. In terms of a price target, the predicted target is around $10, which would translate to an 18,000% increase from the 2022 bear market low. Although this percentage gain is notably smaller than the 54,890% rally seen during Dogecoin’s 2021 cycle, the capital required to create such an increase is significantly higher due to the cryptocurrency’s market cap. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2669 and is up by 1.1% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Despite the uncertainty, Solana remains one of the strongest assets in the crypto market, sustaining its bullish momentum that has been in place since 2023. Investors and analysts are closely watching this key level, as maintaining support above $200 is essential to confirm further upside potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin Looks Stronger Compared To Altcoins – Demand Remains Strong As Price Consolidates In A Range Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana’s current position. He noted that SOL is holding the key support level so far and emphasized the importance of a bounce from this region to sustain short-term bullish momentum. According to Jelle, reclaiming $220 is the first mission for bulls, as it would set the stage for another rally toward recent highs. However, failure to hold above $200 could spell trouble, potentially leading to further downside and a more extended consolidation period. With the market experiencing high volatility, this week will be crucial in determining Solana’s short-term trajectory. If bulls defend key support levels and reclaim resistance zones, SOL could be on track for another push higher, continuing its impressive run from last year. Solana at a Critical Juncture: Can Bulls Take Control? Solana has retraced 40% from its all-time high, sparking concerns among investors who fear a prolonged correction. While SOL has been one of the strongest assets in this cycle, recent price action has left market participants uncertain about its short-term direction. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Despite institutional interest and a pro-crypto U.S. administration, the market remains plagued by doubt, with altseason narratives struggling to gain traction. The level of uncertainty surrounding crypto markets is unprecedented compared to past bull runs, leading to increased hesitation among retail investors. However, some analysts remain bullish on Solana’s long-term prospects. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is holding the key support level around $200 so far. He emphasized that for SOL to remain short-term bullish, a bounce from this region is necessary. If bulls step in and defend this level, Jelle expects a surge above $220 in the near future, which could pave the way for a broader recovery. If Solana holds above $200 and reclaims key resistance levels, it would signal renewed strength and confirm a potential rally back toward all-time highs. However, if SOL breaks below support, further downside could follow, reinforcing bearish sentiment across the market. The coming days will be crucial in determining the next phase of Solana’s price action. SOL Price Holds Key Support At $200 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $205, maintaining a crucial support level at $200. This price point is critical for short-term momentum, as holding above it strengthens the bullish case for another leg higher. If bulls can sustain this level and push above $220, a strong breakout could follow, potentially taking SOL back into all-time high (ATH) territory. However, if $200 fails to hold, SOL could face a deeper correction, with the next major demand zone around $180. A drop to this level could signal a longer consolidation phase, delaying the anticipated bullish continuation. For now, Solana remains in a decisive phase, where market structure and buying pressure will determine the next major move. If SOL reclaims $220, a rally back toward $250-$260 becomes increasingly likely. On the other hand, losing $200 would shift sentiment bearish, putting downward pressure on price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Must Hold Above $97K To Sustain Momentum – Metrics With strong fundamentals and bullish long-term momentum, investors are closely watching Solana’s price action. The next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether SOL can resume its uptrend or face further downside pressure.

According to a crypto analyst, this new development could present an attractive buying opportunity for investors, especially as the market consolidates. XRP Price Golden Support Could Trigger Rebound A crypto analyst, known as “ColdBloodedCharter’ on TradingView, has presented a detailed technical chart analysis of XRP, discussing its current position, potential future trends, and key buying levels. The analyst disclosed that XRP is currently inside a Golden Pocket, supported by a 50-day Moving Average (MA) directly below it.  Related Reading: XRP Bulls Shake Off Crash, Target This Major Resistance On The Road To $3.85 The analyst noted that his previous analysis from the day before was playing out exactly as planned, with the new Golden Pocket acting as a resistance level when approached from below. On a short-term outlook, the TradingView crypto expert expects no immediate breakout for the XRP price. This bleak forecast is attributed to the possible selling pressure fueled by the recent 500 million XRP escrow unlocks initiated by Ripple Labs earlier this week.  The analyst also cited XRP’s current consolidation phase, which started 19 days after hitting a cycle high, as a barrier to an immediate bullish price breakout. The last consolidation phase lasted as long as 39 days after XRP had reached $2.91 on December 3, 2024. Looking at the analyst’s price chart, XRP formed a Bullish Pennant pattern, which led to an earlier breakout in 2024 before its consolidation phase. Based on this past trend, the TradingView analyst predicts that XRP could experience another two to three weeks of choppy price action before initiating its next big move. The triangle pattern on the XRP price chart suggests a strong rebound towards a bullish price target at $3.43 if the cryptocurrency can hold its Golden Pocket support.  Key Buy Levels To Watch While ColdBloodedCharter projects a rally to $3.43 for the XRP price, the TradingView analyst has also outlined key buy-the-dip levels investors can watch out for in preparation for this potential surge. The $2.50 level will be a primary support area for XRP, offering investors a 6-7% discount from current low prices. Related Reading: XRP Long Term Potential Remains Extremely Bullish Possibility Of Price At $20 If XRP plunges further, the analyst expects it to reach the support levels between $2.25 and $2.30. He reveals that this price level is a much safer entry point and accumulation zone for investors, especially if Bitcoin (BTC) remains above $95,000. The analyst has also highlighted a steeper support zone between $1.9 and $2.00. This support presents a significant dip-buy opportunity and is expected to occur if Bitcoin experiences a sharp pullback to new lows around $91,000.  While further market declines will serve as a buying opportunity for many investors, they also pose a risk to those who purchased XRP during price highs. The TradingView analyst has revealed that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is cooling down, suggesting weakening market momentum. However, he remains optimistic, predicting a strong reversal soon.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Why Bitcoin Wins No Matter The Outcome Of Trump’s Trade War,2025-02-05 18:30:27+00:00,"In an escalation of global economic friction, President Trump’s imposed tariffs have roiled financial markets this week, cutting across both equities, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Yet a new memo from Bitwise Asset Management suggests that these headwinds might ultimately propel Bitcoin to new heights—regardless of whether Trump’s strategy succeeds or fails. At the beginning of the week, the crypto market witnessed a severe sell-off. Bitcoin declined by about 5%, while Ethereum and XRP suffered even sharper losses—17% and 18%, respectively. The immediate catalyst was Trump’s imposition of a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% tariff on China. In retaliation, those trading partners announced countermeasures of their own. Related Reading: Key Indicator Signals DCA Opportunity Amid Bitcoin Buyer Momentum The US dollar reacted by jumping more than 1% against major currencies. That, combined with lingering weekend illiquidity in crypto markets, triggered a wave of forced liquidations as leveraged traders sold into the downdraft. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, as much as $10 billion in leveraged positions was wiped out in what he described as “the largest liquidation event in crypto’s history.” Despite the dramatic price action, Bitwise’s Head of Alpha Strategies, Jeffrey Park, remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s trajectory. He points to two guiding ideas that shape his bullish thesis: the ‘Triffin Dilemma’ and President Trump’s broader aim to restructure America’s trade dynamics. The Triffin Dilemma highlights the conflict between a currency serving as a global reserve—generating consistent demand and overvaluation—and the need to run persistent trade deficits to supply enough currency abroad. While this status allows the US to borrow cheaply, it also puts sustained pressure on domestic manufacturing and exports. “Trump wants to get rid of the negatives, but keep the positives,” Park explains, suggesting that tariffs may be a negotiating tool to compel other nations to the table—reminiscent of the 1985 Plaza Accord, which devalued the dollar in coordination with other major economies. The Two Scenarios: Bitcoin Wins, Fiat Loses Park argues that Bitcoin stands to benefit under two distinct outcomes of Trump’s current trade policy: Scenario 1: Trump Succeeds in Weakening the Dollar (While Keeping Rates Low) If Trump can maneuver a multilateral agreement—akin to a ‘Plaza Accord 2.0’—to reduce the dollar’s overvaluation without boosting long-term interest rates, risk appetite among US investors could surge. In this environment, a non-sovereign asset like Bitcoin, free from capital controls and dilution, would likely attract additional inflows. Meanwhile, other nations grappling with the fallout of a weaker dollar might deploy fiscal and monetary stimulus to support their economies, potentially driving even more capital toward alternative assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: After The Bitcoin Crash: Will It Rise Or Drop Again? 5 Key Indicators “If Trump can bully his way into the position, there’s no asset better positioned than bitcoin. Lower rates will spark the risk appetite of US investors, sending prices high. Abroad, countries will face weakened economies, and will turn to classic economic stimulus to compensate, leading again to higher bitcoin prices,” Park argues. Scenario 2: A Prolonged Trade War And Massive Money Printing If Trump fails to secure a broad-based deal and the trade war grinds on, global economic weakness would almost certainly invite extensive monetary stimulus from central banks. Historically, such large-scale liquidity injections have been bullish for Bitcoin, as investors seek deflationary and decentralized assets insulated from central bank policies “And what if he fails? What if, instead, we get a sustained tariff war? Our high-conviction view is the resulting economic weakness will lead to money printing on a scale larger than we’ve ever seen. And historically, such stimulus has been extraordinarily good for bitcoin,” Park says.. At press time, BTC traded at $98,557.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum Recovers To $2,800 As Exchange Outflows Near $1 Billion",2025-02-05 17:00:07+00:00,"Ethereum has made a recovery to $2,800 during the past day as on-chain data shows the whales have been making massive withdrawals from exchanges. Ethereum Exchange Outflows Spiked After Price Crash According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, investors reacted to the latest crash in the Ethereum price by making outflows from exchanges. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which keeps track of the net amount of the cryptocurrency that’s entering into or exiting the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Elevated Despite Long Squeeze, Glassnode Says When the value of this metric is positive, it means the holders are depositing a net number of coins into these platforms. As one of the main reasons why investors transfer to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be a bearish sign for the asset’s price. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests the outflows outweigh the inflows and a net number of tokens is moving out of the exchanges. Such a trend can indicate that the investors are accumulating, which is something that can naturally be bullish for ETH. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Exchange Netflow over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum Exchange Netflow observed a massive negative spike yesterday after the crash in the asset’s price took place. In total, the investors withdrew 350,000 ETH (worth around $982 million at the current exchange rate of the token) from the exchanges in this outflow spree. “This is the highest amount of net exchange withdrawals since January 2024!” notes the analytics firm. Given the timing of the outflows, it would appear likely that they were made by whales looking to buy Ethereum at cheap post-crash prices. The accumulation from the investors has in turn helped the cryptocurrency reach a bottom and make some recovery. Related Reading: Indicator That Foreshadowed XRP’s 14% Crash Gives Buy Signal For Solana The Exchange Netflow could now be to keep an eye on in the coming days, as the upcoming trend in it might also influence the ETH price. Naturally, a continuation of the outflows would be a positive sign, while an increase in inflows could spell a bearish outcome. In some other news, the number two stablecoin by market cap, USDC, has seen its transaction count shoot up recently, as IntoTheBlock has pointed out in another X post. “USDC is becoming increasingly popular, with the number of daily transactions increasing by over 119% in the last year!” says the analytics firm. Stablecoins can end up acting as fuel for volatile assets like Ethereum, so increased activity related to them can be a good sign for the market. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,800, down more than 11% over the last seven days.

Can Mind of Pepe Become a Winner in 2025?,2025-02-05 15:33:35+00:00,"Marc Chaikin is a legendary figure on Wall Street, renowned for spotting market trends before they unfold. His insights have accurately predicted major downturns, including the 2012 Priceline collapse, the COVID-19 market crash, and the recent banking crisis. When Chaikin speaks, Wall Street pays attention. This time, he’s sounding the alarm on the AI frenzy sweeping the U.S. stock market. According to Chaikin, investors holding the wrong AI stocks risk devastating financial losses. He stated, “If you’re holding Nvidia (NVDA) or FAANG right now, it’s time to prepare for a massive shift.” However, Chaikin believes there’s still a lot of money to be made in AI stocks, but only the right ones. Unlike before, picking a random trending stock won’t make you a millionaire. The markets are tough, and only accurate stock picking is the key to success. The Growing AI Demand The demand for AI tech and products is growing by the minute. Companies like Palantir Technologies have benefited hugely from this. The stock is up by more than 60% since mid-January. This comes after a huge 340% increase in stock prices in 2024. This surge in prices is backed by a strong 36% year-on-year revenue growth, which now stands at $828M. Alex Karp, Palantir CEO, credits the ‘untamed’ growth of demand in its AI software for the surge. The company now expects to increase revenue by another 54% in 2025. As you can see, picking the right AI stocks is the need of the hour. However, doing so can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Even then, the probability of the stock making you money is less, given the choppy waters in which AI stocks find themselves. This is where AI agents like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) come in. What Is $MIND? MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an autonomous AI agent that cuts through the information overload floating around about the crypto market and produces actionable insights through hive-mind analysis. What this means is that $MIND can interact with influencers and shape conversations and discussions on platforms like X. In the process, it forms a view of its own to produce triggers for all token holders. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this self-evolving AI agent helps investors identify early opportunities in the market by processing information in real time. The problem with crypto investing is that there’s too much information, all of which may or may not be factual. By the time a human can process this information barrage, the opportunity is long gone. $MIND, on the other hand, uses only real-time information (as fresh as a few seconds ago) to form a view of the markets. This adds to your trading efficiency by cutting down on data deviations. Why Can $MIND Be the Next Big AI Token? MIND of Pepe not only looks to take forward the legendary frog meme legacy but also adds real-time utility for all crypto investors. What would investors love more than regular early-opportunity investment ideas in a dicey AI stock market? Plus, $MIND developers have laid out a long-term vision for the project. Out of a total supply of 100B $MIND tokens, 30% has been reserved for innovation and AI agent updates, while 25% has been kept to support the AI agent ecosystem growth. Early $MIND investors can also earn 443% APY staking rewards – 15% of the token supply has been kept for staking and community incentives. No wonder experts believe $MIND can help investors make crazy gains in this bull run. The $MIND presale is currently live, with the project having already raised $5.1M so far. It’s, in fact, one of the best crypto presales going around right now. Available at a price of just $0.0032662 per token, the next price increase will happen in less than 2 days. This means this is the perfect time to buy the best AI agent coin. Simply visit the official $MIND presale page and connect your wallet. You can buy it with ETH, BNB, or USDT or use your card directly to complete the payment. However, it’s important to remember that crypto markets are subject to volatility and news-based risks. That’s why it is important to do your own research before making any purchases.

Based on his analysis, the next thirty days could be a game-changer, with BTC set to witness a significant move to the upside.  Why The Next 30 Days Could Be A Game Changer As The Bitcoin Price Makes its Move In an X post, CryptoCon predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to as high as $160,000 in the next thirty days. This would be a game-changer for the market, especially considering the bearish sentiment in the crypto market at the moment.

On the other hand, the analyst remarked that the Bitcoin price has spent just 175 days, making meaningful price action to the upside. In line with this, he alluded to how patience is key, considering how Bitcoin ranges for most of the cycle. However, CryptoCon is convinced that the next 30-day sprint of great price action that the market is about to witness is worth the wait.  The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could record up to 37 days of expansion on this next leg up. The chart also showed that the flagship crypto could rally to as high as $160,000 in March following this upward trend. This is bullish for the broader crypto market as altcoins are also expected to rally as BTC moves to the upside. Before now, CryptoCon had already assured that the bull cycle wasn’t over despite the crypto market facing the largest liquidation event in this cycle, with over $2 billion wiped out from the market.    BTC’s Trend Remains Uncertain For Now While the Bitcoin price could rally to $160,000 in the next thirty days, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has stated that BTC’s trend direction in the short term remains uncertain. He noted that the flagship crypto is consolidating between $90,900 and $108,500. The analyst added that the trend remains uncertain until there is a clear breakout beyond this range.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Crashes By $4.5 Billion In One Weekend, Spells Doom For Bulls However, crypto analyst Kevin Capital suggested that the Bitcoin price could soon record a massive bounce to as high as $111,000, marking a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto. He noted that all the major liquidity on the monthly heatmap is to the upside towards this $111,000 price level. The analyst added that this cannot be ignored, especially after a massive capitulation. He further remarked that he would be shocked if BTC didn’t grab this liquidity and head lower.  At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,800, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,5 Best Upcoming Meme Coins to Buy as US Could Introduce ‘GENIUS’ Stablecoin Bill,2025-02-05 14:08:18+00:00,"After a somewhat difficult start to the week, stablecoins, meme coins, and the crypto market in general saw a glimmer of light yesterday, with the introduction of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Introduced by US senator Bill Hagerty, the bill aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. If passed into legislation, Tether ($USDT), USD Coin ($USDC), and other stable coins with market caps above the $10B mark would need to adhere to US Federal Reserve regulations. Meanwhile, stablecoins with market caps below the $10B threshold would be regulated by the individual states. Hagerty announced the introduction of GENIUS at yesterday’s White House press conference on digital assets. At the same press meeting, AI and crypto adviser David Sacks noted that ‘Stablecoins have the potential to ensure American dollar dominance internationally to increase the usage of the US dollar digitally as the world’s reserve currency and in the process create potentially trillions of dollars of demand for the US Treasury.’ What Does The GENIUS Act Mean For Stablecoins, Meme Coins, And Other Altcoins The Trump administration being in support of stablecoins – or any type of cryptocurrency for that matter – is good news all the way. And while the market has seen a downturn, the community sentiment is bullish. With prices generally down across the board, now’s a good time to buy the dip. That’s especially true when it comes to meme coins, which exploded last year. If you’re thinking of investing in meme coins, here are five that have high growth potential. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – The First-ever Solana Layer 2 Ecosystem Solaxy ($SOLX) is grabbing a lot of investor attention – and for good reason. This meme coin, currently in presale, will power the world’s first-ever Solana Layer 2 ecosystem. Exciting news indeed. Not only will it incorporate Solana’s outstanding characteristics (good speed and low transaction fees) but it will also get rid of the pain points that plague the Solana blockchain – congestion and failed transactions. If that’s not enough good news, it will add even more speed and scalability to the equation. In all, it means a highly robust platform for meme coins and dApps. $SOLX is also a multi-chain token, yet another reason why we have high hopes for Solaxy. It will exist on both Solana (renowned for the hottest meme coins) and Ethereum, which has a massive DeFi and asset tokenization ecosystem. The Solaxy presale launched in December last year, raising an $5.8M in the first five days alone. That figure now stands at a hefty $18M. A price increase is imminent, but 1 SOLX currently costs $0.001626, with 224% staking rewards. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – A Powerful AI Agent With Valuable Insights For Token Holders Another meme coin we’re keeping a close eye on is MIND of Pepe ($MIND). More than just yet another iteration of Pepe the Frog, this is a powerful AI agent, and the first meme coin of its kind. The Pepes of the crypto world often do very well for themselves. Take Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), for instance – another Pepe-inspired meme coin currently on presale. $WEPU has become a phenomenon, having raised close to $69.5M (yes, you read that figure correctly). And as the presale draws to a close, all eyes will be on $MIND to see if it follows in $WEPE’s footsteps. $MIND will set up autonomous X and other social media accounts, and it’ll use those to amass a follower base and identify upcoming crypto market trends, through the clever use of hive-mind analysis. AI is the driving force behind this meme coin, enabling it to continuously learn and self-evolve. And as $MIND’s influencer status grows, it will shape conversations and gain valuable insights, which MIND of Pepe will share exclusively with $MIND token holders. MIND of Pepe will even have blockchain access and the ability to launch tokens. And, of course, $MIND holders will have exclusive early-bird access to those. The MIND of Pepe presale has already raised more than $5M, and right now 1 $MIND will cost you $0.0032662 (with staking rewards at 444%). To find out more about how you can invest in $MIND using $ETH, $BNB, $USDT, or $USD, take a look at our guide to buying $MIND. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Coin Baskets For Greater Exposure With The Benefit Of Diversified Risk Exposure is the name of the Meme Index ($MEMEX) game. The meme coin market exploded last year, but as even the past week has reminded us, the crypto market is unpredictable. That’s why risk diversification is highly appealing to investors, and $MEMEX does just that. $MEMEX has four meme coin baskets (in another word, indexes) to choose from, each with varying levels of volatility. The Titan Index is the least volatile but with slower rewards. It’s home to $DOGE, $SHIB, $FLOKI, $PEPE, and more of the top and better-established meme coins. Up next is the Moonshot Index, where you’ll find meme coins that are poised to rub shoulders with their counterparts in the Titan basket, but have market caps below $1B. $POPCAT and $PNUT are two of the meme coins in this index. The Midcap Index, meanwhile, is where the risk factor is turned up a notch further. Tokens in this meme coin basket, among them $TURBO and $BOME, have considerable growth potential but, at the same time, are also prone to volatility. Then, there’s the Frenzy Index, which cranks up the heat with high-risk tokens that have potentially explosive rewards. Think $ZEREBRO, for instance. Being Degen territory, however, this index is not for the faint of heart. $MEMEX holders have the additional benefit of community governance, with ability to propose and vote on both the future of the project, as well as which meme coins are in the four indexes. To date, Meme Index has raised close to $3.4M, and 1 $MEMEX costs $0.0159077, with 687% staking rewards. It won’t stay that price for long, though, with a price increase set for less than two days.. 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – A Humor-centric Meme Coin With Lots Of Potential When the market takes a tumble, as it recently has, no one would be blamed for having a good cry. However, a good laugh thanks to Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is another alternative, one that could well pay off in the long term. The premise of Fartcoin is simple – initial tokens could be claimed by submitting fart jokes and memes. Launched in late 2024 on the Solana blockchain, $FARTCOIN also features a ‘Gas Fee’ system, with each transaction accompanied by a digital fart sound. As for utility? There is none. Yet after a CEX listing with a $978M market cap, and reaching the $1B market cap milestone in January, who are we to judge? Like the rest of the market, Fartcoin has been left bruised by the recent downturn.   After an all-time high of $2.61 in mid-January, the price has since plummeted to $0.7015. But with the swings and roundabouts of the crypto market, we think $FARTCOIN could recover, with potential for, forgive the pun, explosive growth. 5. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – The Resilient Meme Coin New To Solana Technically speaking, Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) isn’t exactly new, having been on the Ethereum blockchain since 2021. But in December last year, in a move to extend its community and attract new investors, $PENGU launched on Solana. And it’s been (mostly) onwards and upwards ever since then. Pudgy Penguins is an NFT collection of 8,888 pudgy little cartoon characters – representing love, happiness, empathy, and compassion, among other emotions. But don’t let that ‘awwwww’ factor fool you – $PENGU packs a punch. To be fair, the recent downturn of the crypto market has been less than kind to our little penguin friend. Just under a month ago, for instance, Pudgy Penguins had a $2B+ market cap. That market cap has since dropped to a comparatively dismal $820M.   But – and it’s a big but – $PENGU has historically been a strong performer, and we expect this resilient little meme coin to recover in due course. After an all-time high of $0.05738 in mid December, it hit an all-time low of $0.01015 two days ago. Right now, $PENGU is up +28.59% on that ATL, at $0.01298. And that price is an increase of 159.63% for the year, according to CoinMarketCap. In A Nutshell… The recent ‘trade wars’ have hit the crypto market hard. So it’s a relief that the GENIUS Act and other crypto-focused legislation is being formalized to the market’s benefit. And the current downturn is a good time to buy the dip. As for the best crypto presales, now’s the time to invest at a low private sale price before listing. But remember, it’s important to always DYOR before making any investment decision.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,BNB Chain Defies Expectations With Over 20% Surge To $750 – Details,2025-02-05 14:00:23+00:00,"BNB Chain has been making headlines, setting records, and drawing investors worldwide. With a strong Q4 2024 and a $750 all-time high, its Binance-backed token is proving its mettle in a volatile market. Related Reading: Bitcoin $100K Breakdown Spells Trouble For Short-Term Investors—Study The Market Cap Growth Of BNB Chain Although the last year has been somewhat turbulent for BNB, the fourth quarter of 2024 was a pivotal moment. Recent data shows that BNB’s market capitalization reached a solid $100 billion year-on-year (YoY). Messari’s most recent quarterly report indicates that in Q4 2024, BNB Chain grew significantly. The triumph of US President-elect Donald Trump set off a positive crypto market that enabled the price of the crypto to soar on December 7 to an all-time high of $750. Driven by growing institutional interest and demand for blockchain-based assets, this expansion conforms more to general market trends. Network engagement has also been vital for BNB Chain’s development. By means of continuous improvements of projects and developers under the Binance Smart Chain, its ecosystem is reinforced and its key role among blockchain systems is confirmed. Price Ascent And Market Reactions On December 7, 2024, BNB reached $750 per token, marking a new milestone. Rising demand for Binance’s ecosystem, strategic token burning, and improved macroeconomic conditions supporting the bitcoin market have all contributed to this spike. But, after hitting its peak, BNB faced the expected corrections. BNB is now trading for around $573 as of early February 2025, which is consistent with usual market fluctuations. Despite this, investor mood remains broadly positive, with many experts viewing it as a temporary reversal rather than a sign of a long-term collapse. Price Predictions And Future Outlook Market analysts continue to have high hopes for BNB’s future. While altcoin Investors project a maximum price of $1,000, CoinCodex projects that BNB might rise as high as $732 by March 2025. According to these projections, BNB still has space to develop as a result of ongoing adoption, Binance’s growing clout, and possible regulatory clarity in key areas. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market At Risk If Key $97,000 Support Level Fails To Hold, Analyst Warns Also, regular updates to the network and token incinerations may help keep prices rising. In the past, Binance has worked to keep prices stable and increase long-term value by regularly destroying some of its tokens. What’s Next For BNB? With its past success and strong basics, BNB offers optimism for the future. The bitcoin market is usually unstable, but the altcoin has shown that it can handle challenges and benefit from increases in value. Investors will closely watch changes in laws, the overall market situation, and future updates in the Binance ecosystem. It’s uncertain if BNB will reach a price in the thousands this year, but it remains an important part of the digital asset market.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Can These New Crypto Coins Explode After Travala-Trivago Crypto Integration?,2025-02-05 13:31:30+00:00,"Crypto continues to pave its way into the biggest industries in the world. In a first-of-its-kind move, Travala, which is a web3 platform and a travel website known for accepting crypto payments, has joined hands with Trivago. Over 2.2M Trivago properties now support bookings via crypto thanks to Travala’s integration. Customers will be able to choose from dozens of cryptocurrencies, including $BTC and $ETH. What’s more, Travala will also offer loyalty tokens (in $BTC or $AVA) to hotelgoers who use crypto for hotel bookings on Trivago. It’s also worth noting that Travala had previously launched a Bitcoin and AVA treasury plan in December 2024, so this is not their first rodeo. Overall, with an increasing number of companies embracing crypto, there’s likely going to be a huge spike in investor interest in crypto projects in the coming months. To help you make the most of crypto’s breakthrough into everyday use, here are 5 new crypto coins you can consider investing in in 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Best New Crypto Coin to Buy for 100x Return in 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has proven itself as a worthy descendant of the OG Pepe. It’s easily the best-performing crypto presale right now, with close to $70M in presale funding. Moreover, it’s now within touching distance from the highest ever presale raise before listing, which was by its big brother Pepe Unchained ($73M). What’s the hype, you ask? $WEPE aims to level the playing field by making the unfair dominance of crypto whales a thing of the past. These institutional investors hide behind insider information and use it to manipulate the markets. $WEPE will provide token holders with unique market insights, strategies, and real-time trading calls so that they can flip the script and become profitable. Additionally, the project has set aside an impressive 15% of its total token supply to reward token holders who share their profitable trading tactics. Join the $WEPE army now for just $0.0003665, but hurry up because the presale ends in just 11 days. If you need more assistance, check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First-Ever Layer 2 Solution for Fast & Reliable Throughputs Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, designed with the purpose of elevating Solana to a whole new level. $SOLX, one of the best meme coins, will remove Solana’s critical flaws, including network congestion, limited scalability, and transactions not going through as reliably as they should.  By combining Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s efficiency (Solaxy is a multi-chain crypto), it’ll not only execute transactions super quickly but also at a more affordable rate than any other rival.  Moreover, the potential launch of Solana ETFs, which look very likely, by the way, is also going to send $SOLX prices soaring after its launch. Combined with how insanely popular Solana has become in recent months, Solaxy is looking set to be the next 100x meme coin. The $SOLX presale has raised over $18M so far, and interested investors can get in now for just $0.001626 per token. Here’s how to buy $SOLX. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – A Less Risky Approach to Meme Coins Investments Meme Index ($MEMEX) is undoubtedly a revolutionary project, seeing as it simplifies crypto investment for newbies and conservative traders who want to benefit from what the crypto economy has to offer but without taking on zero-or-hero type trades. Essentially, Meme Index is exactly like your mutual funds provider for the stock market, i.e., it allows you to diversify your risk. $MEMEX offers four different baskets of meme coins, and you can take your pick depending on the amount of risk (and profit potential) you’re willing to carry. For instance, for steadier and safer returns, as well as less volatility during market-wide liquidation (like last week’s), something like the Meme Titan Index will be a perfect pick.  On the contrary, if you want to be more aggressive during a full-blown bull run, consider investing in the Meme Frenzy Index with potential for exponential gains. 1 $MEMEX is currently available for $0.0158443, and early adopters can also utilize the project’s 678% staking rewards to create a nifty passive income source on the side. 4. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – New PolitFi Crypto with the Highest Potential Although it was Donald Trump’s new tariff plan that caused a huge liquidation in the crypto market over the weekend, including his own meme coin, Official Trump ($TRUMP) has jumped over 10% in the last 24 hours, breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern – a major bullish signal. This proves that Trump continues to be a favorite among crypto enthusiasts, who are banking on him to take crypto to the moon.  $TRUMP shot up by over 12,000% immediately after its launch in late January, making mind-boggling returns for early investors.  It’s currently trading at $19.21, which, considering its PolitiFi nature and Trump’s overall bullish stance on crypto, could be a great entry point for both short and long-term investors. Although the token fell after making all-time highs (which is natural, by the way), it’s still the fourth biggest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market capitalization – it has a market cap of over $3.8B. 5. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – Elon Musk’s Sweetheart Poised for Growth With increasing crypto adoption, it’d make sense to invest in a coin like $DOGE that has the potential to break into everyday use. We say this because there have been several reports of Dogecoin becoming a government-backed cryptocurrency. Moreover, Elon Musk could also integrate $DOGE into X Money’s payment platform, which would only result in a massive inflow in the token’s already massive $40B market cap. Despite falling prices, analysts are confident in Dogecoin’s future potential, suggesting that it may actually lead crypto gains this month. You can get 1 $DOGE for just $0.2667 right now. Conclusion These were the 5 best new crypto coins you should consider including in your 2025 portfolio. At the same time, though, beware that the crypto economy, like other markets, is prone to violent ups and downs. This is why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing.

Yes it has a static IP and yes all the UDP ports work, I checked by sending the info to myself.
I must add that right now my server only listens and I send my contact info from my pc. There is no ping/pong or periodic update yet, but for just receiving the first few bytes from ANYONE shouldn‘t require that or am I missing something? Any info is welcome!",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

I’m looking for a way to use a private Solana RPC node without having to write custom code. My main goal is to leverage the speed and reliability of a private node for trading or automation purposes, but I don’t have much experience with programming.

Are there any no-code or low-code platforms that allow users to:

Connect and interact with a private node easily
Execute transactions faster than public RPCs
Automate processes like trading, token interactions, or copy trading
I’ve seen services like QuickNode, Alchemy, Helius, but I’m not sure if they offer tools for non-developers.

Reddit,solana,From being addicted to gambling to meme coins,2025-02-04 17:34:47,"I’m 30 years old, wife, no kid yet. My wife and I make decent salary compared to cost of living. (Midwest, not in a big city, have a home we bought June 2023 that has appreciated $45,000-50,000 since then at least). My wife and I are both government workers who will get a pension and make about $130,000 combined (my pay will max out at over 6 figs eventually) 

My wife is debt free as of a couple months ago and I have about $4,000 credit card debt. (I have a 1.3k tax refund coming so I’m still being positive) 

But I started sports gambling about 2021. It was bad, because back then cost of living was a tad lower, we had an apartment that was under $500 a month so even though I made less at that time I had a paid off 2011 car as well. I made $2600 month take home back then, so a lot of money to throw around (never was good at saving). I got into sports gambling, started with winning $20 parlays to turn into $350 etc. 

I made some decent investments in sports cards etc and made about 8-10k. We used this money to travel Europe where I proposed and I also started a side hustle (inflatable rental business company that I still run in summers, I don’t plan on growing it and only use it for side cash) 

I guess where my addiction was amplified was when i applied to get approved for an IDHA loan through my state (first time home buyer loan), they asked for bank statements. I applied in March of 2023. They denied me at that time saying “we see that up until March you’ve made $1800 sports gambling, we have to be fair with this loan and in our calculations we assume that you will be consistently winning $900 per month throughout the year which would push you over the income limit for the loan”

The lender told me I either need to wait until
June to reapply and not gamble at all till then so they won’t calculate future gambling winnings or to make a very large bet and lose on purpose.. so I made a $1,800 bet - 3 pick parlay on nba. I got lucky and that hit hit and paid me about $7,500. I took that money and used it for a down payment. We got the home inspected and will love our house. But the home inspector fucked us and on day one our ac/furnace wasn’t working which cost us $8500 total. 

I got into a tcg early and went to Gen con in Indiana and made some investments in that game early and made about 8-10k so we could pay it off. Around this time I started getting crazy with bets $300-1000 bets at a time on DraftKings. I’m still technically up, maybe 4k total. But I have recently banned myself from the sports betting apps because although I started betting smaller $25-50 bets I was going on a long losing streak and realized that I was spending more time looking at my parlays and tv to watch the game than not being present with those I love.

About 2 weeks ago I got into meme coins
My wife did warn me that it seems like what I’m doing is just something to replace my sports betting gambling. I started with $600 in SOL and built it into about 1k. My goal was to just build up to $1,200 to double my money and move stuff back into traditional crypto to help me pay off my $4,000 in credit card debt I have. 

About 2 weeks ago my brother (who invested $1,000 usd) and cousin (who invested $500 usd) got in early on a coin on Sol called $Ainti when it was announced at under 1 cent. 2 weeks ago Janice mcafee tweeted and the coin pumped up to $1. My brother (who is kinda already rich) turned his $1,000 into $115,000 usd when he cashed out and my cousin (who’s broke and had debt) turned his $500 into about $75,000 usd. I guess this is what initially gravitated me toward phantom wallet. I tried telling my cousin it was luck and he would get pissed saying it was months of research (he’s only been in crypto since October 2024. 

I figured if they can’t 400x their money why can’t I 2x mine? 

The thing is, they did get lucky.. but I didn’t know it at the time.

I started with $600, turned it into $1,000 slowly. I played safe generally buying into coins wity $30-50 and getting out after making 20-30% increase or so

I also got rugged a couple times and lost money. I got rugged out of $600 yesterday and it.. hurt lol. The thing I didn’t realize is meme coins are way riskier than sports gambling even. It’s not other traders you are going up against. It’s scam artists. People constantly rug pulling 90% of projects and you don’t know when it will happen. 


I had fun with this, I’m not here trashing meme coins. Even though I lost, it was entertaining, but I’m now realizing this was just another scapegoat to replace me banning myself on sports apps. I gotta be done with both though lol. 

I guess some people get lucky and get that 1000x like my brother and cousin and maybe my luck will come later in life in some other way. lol. (I was on a 3 way phone call with them while their money was exploding up to $75,000 and $115,000 within 1.5-2 hours. I was happy for them, but also slightly jealous).

I’ve been putting paying off these credit cards for too long due to me not wanting to address them and pretend as if they’re not there.. so I will lay low and have a boring life until those are paid off now lol. ",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,solana,I want to code a bot and need to know if this strategy is viable.,2025-02-05 05:13:28,"Some backstory: I got really lucky with my Solana investment. I got in ridiculously early and have DCA'd into a really good position, more money than I would ever need to spend really. But now I want my solana to work for me. So I'm coding a simple bot. Thing is, I'm not a greedy man. I don't want to hit 100x on a meme coin or screw around and risk my Solana. I really just want a small, passive income to pay my bills with. So, essentially, my plan is to ""short"" my Solana through the daily ups and downs of the price. The bot I'm coding will simply take the price at the start of the day (4am) and convert my Solana to USDC, then every hour it will check the price, if it dips around 0.5% within that hour, it will convert the whole amount back to Solana, do a little calculation and then transfer the difference into a separate wallet. Leaving my original amount of Solana untouched. It will only do this once a day and only when it has reached its daily threshold of -0.5%. I don't need a lot of money. I live a very cheap existence, so I'm calculating I'd only need about £70-£100 a day to survive comfortably and pay my taxes. But is this viable? I've backtested a few weeks of Solana prices and it's looking doable. But I thought I should run it by you lot, to make sure.

Edit: Staking is not legal in the UK, so please don't point out that I could probably make just as much if I staked the Solana.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,solana,To all newcomers: BE VERY CAREFUL IN WHO YOU TRUST,2025-02-04 20:20:27,"Sooo, I'll start this by saying don't be retarded like me and NEVER, NEVER FUCKING EVER do what I just did. And I'm not a beginner, I'm in crypto since 2017, and in sol I'm a pumpfun dev since july last year. And I FUCKED UP. I FUCKED UP BADLY.

So in the beginning I had no idea what I'm doing, had no budget, managed to take 3 tokens to ray by livestreaming for days in a row, but only got more or less a breakeven on them cuz I spent most of the money on bumps, useless callers, botted kols, and so on. Anyway, at least I learned. I learned how to use a bumpbot, I learned how to set up the telegram bots, like d.raidbot, majorbuybot, safeguard, rose, I learned how to use trojan for buy and sell, how to do better website designs, animated banners, and so on. But most importantly, I met people that were in this game for a way longer time than me. Some of them I became friends with, others tried to scam me, others had a weird vibe, so I stayed away from them, and with some of them I started doing token launches together... What could go wrong, right?

Well, besides 3 real life friends that helped me with the launches (mostly to make profit from them, while I did most of the work... but that's another story) I met a few ok guys and we did some good launches together, they helped me as part of the team, with marketing funds, raiding, modding on tg, and I helped them on their launches too. With them, everything went fine and we're still keeping in touch even tho some of them quit pumpfun/sol because of the toxicity and overall bad nature of the space.

But I also met another guy... He helped a lot, not gonna lie, we talked now and then, he taught me some stuff, we did two great launches, one was a cto done after Ray, the other was an organic launch started on pumpfun, no bundle, nothing but the livestream, bumps and so on. On both of them he managed the marketing and funding (spent over 20 sols on each project, the cto even had a 500x boost), he used Fatality, he spent for trendings, kols, and so on. Meanwhile, I handled the twitter raids, telegram modding, hyping up the people and I also livestreamed on thelaunches. So I started to trust him. He was always the guy willing to do marketing and make a project work, he had the marketing experience and money, while I handled the people interaction and modding aspect, and was the face of the project. There's no way he would scam me, right? Right?

Well, it all started to go downhill in late November I think... He kept talking about launches not working anymore, and using his ""custom made futures bot"" to trade on Binance (I knew the guy works in cybersec and builds his own bots, so I believed him), so I sent him 2 sol so he can trade them, and make me a bit of extra profit to use for future launches and so on. Anyway, left him that money to trade... Then before Christmas, he told me that he made 3 sols profit, so I had 5 sols, but Binance had locked his funds, and showed me screenshots from the discussions with the customer support, etc. Sent him 4 sols to buy presents for family and stuff, cuz he told me his funds are locked and he can't buy anything and he's desperate. That should have been a big red flag (that he still had my 2 sols + asked for more) but I'm retarded, emotional, I trust and try to help people I know sometimes and he seemed desperate... Then I said that maybe, after he fixes the binance stuff, he might trade the other \~10 ish sols I had, to make an x2-x3, and to use the money for some bigger launches... I was greedy, I was retarded, I didn't think straight... He told me he can't use binance, but he can trade with another bot made by him that makes less profit... 

Sent him the money, and kept 0.6 sol for myself, to have for the new years eve and so on. He told me to tell him the exact dates when I need the money+profit back, so he knows when to send them... Told him to send me 3 sols on 3-4 Jan, cuz I had to go to the dentist the week after that, and to send me another 4 or 5 sols on 12 jan, so I can pay my rent and bills on 15... And that's when he started with the bullshit.

  
He kept delaying and delaying, saying that he can't send the money because they're stuck with some other guy, and that guy is busy and will come back in a few days (he sent me screenshots, probably fake ones where he talked to himself on another account...). And he kept delaying... I canceled my dentist appointment. I got left with \~7$, and I had to ask some friends for money to buy food. I had to ask the landlord to postpone my rent for the next week. I had 3 major mental breakdowns, on one of them I went nuts and sent 1370 messages to the guy, while I was crying and swinging between wanting to punch walls or jump off the window and kms :/ He kept saying that he's gonna send the money, soon, it's gonna be fixed, while I was slowly losing my fucking mind.

Eventually I paid the rent using the security deposit from the landlord, but I had to move out cuz I couldn't pay the rent anymore... Some friends helped me with food, a bit of money, and now I moved into a friends place, I'm staying in their living room for a while, until I figure out what to do next. Most likely I'll try to launch a token and try to recover some of the lost money, and then try to slowly climb up the ladder and try to get out of the trenches once again.

Soo yeah, be super careful in who you trust...

Anyway, TL;DR: lost everything cuz I got scammed by a guy that I trusted, I did launches together with him, he always had money, so I didn't think he would go that low and scam me... It's a reason they're called the trenches, everyone is out to get you unfortunately :/

Also, I'll attach some screenshots with the conversations if I can, maybe it will help other people not to fall for scams like these:

I joined the industry a couple of weeks ago and started learning all about crypto and the blockchain technology. Watched some bitcoin educators, Started following some guys on X, invested in some serious crypto projects and eventually got rugged by trump and melania. That’s where I found out about those meme coins and stumbled upon sites like pumpfun, photon, dexscreener. I even let a scam bot login to my telegram (thankfully I didn’t have any wallets connected yet)

Im kinda fascinated by this memecoin trading bots and stuff. Obviously I avoid using any trading sites or bots until now because I don’t want to get scammed. All these bots take fees.
All these sites take fees. And I learned trading with low amounts (like under 0.1 SOL makes you lose more money than make any profit)

So the point of this post is to ask you guys, what are your experiences with memecoin trading?

Since I’m also a coding enthusiast I thought of making my own trading bot and using rpc services like quicknode or geyser. Any tips ?

How can I trade meme coins on blockchain directly to avoid those ridiculous fees ?

Thank you and take care

Reddit,solana,"Issue with Solana, DEC or Token?",2025-02-04 18:41:51,"Edit; meant to say DEX on title


Hey all, have a solana Technical question and seeking some help, as I’m not really aware of how it all works. Will try to keep vague just in case it’s a big issue and rather inform the people privately.

There’s a token that’s not yet available for purchase through exchanges, allegedly. I found the address _somehow_ (it’s easy to be found).

So I basically took the address and searched for the token on Phantom app. It is there. When I first tried to buy, it didn’t allow me. I placed a random $SOL value to exchange and the offer was 0.

I decided to check it out every now and then, and then on one attempt, it allowed me to buy 0.99 tokens. The cost was something like 0.0005 sol for it. Any value above that, provided the same amount of tokens: 0.99, so I tried a bit to see what was the minimum I could afford.

Then when I tried to swap for sol again, it offered back something similar of what I paid. Interestingly, I decided to keep trying that every now and then. 

Eventually, it offered more:

• 0.00001 $token for 0.02SOL
• 0.00001 $token for 0.04SOL
• 0.00001 $token for 0.45SOL 👀

Feels like there’s something wrong in the whole thing and I have no idea if it’s Solana, Phantom, Raydium, Jupiter or the token itself.

I’ve sent an email to Phantom and Raydium to let them know but not sure who’s the right people that need this information.

Any ideas of what should I do next?

TLDR; swapped less than 0.001 $SOL for 0.99 of a token that shouldn’t be available and then I managed to convert a fraction of that into 0.5 Sol. Help on how to move next",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,solana,Need some help with understanding the liquidity pool,2025-02-04 07:32:49,"I’m working on building a utility coin but am a little confused on how to manage the liquidity pool as it relates to my token prices. I want it to be quoted in SOL but have each token worth $1 each. I guess I could use USDT but from a user on-ramp standpoint it seems like just doing it based on a SOL swap is easier. 

I’ve got my token set up and I made an OpenBook market ID as well but am at the point of building the liquidity pool. I’ve made 100mn tokens, but I want to make sure they don’t get sniped when I create the pool. What math do I need to use so that the liquidity i create is based on the amount I initially put in while having it tied to the US dollar?

Do I just hold on to like 99,999,000 tokens, release 1000 of them at $1 a piece? Can I release more to the market in a slow manner? Or do I just release 49% of them so nobody can make a run and liquidate my entire supply of tokens?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

I was searching so hard and thought my wallet got compromised or something. Turns out, when I was putting the take profits and stop losses, the priority fee was set to 0.01 SOL and bribery fee was 0.02 SOL. Please don’t flame me yall but since im new and starting off with a small portfolio, I usually put 0.001 for both priority fee and bribery fee.. Anyways, I’m guessing the take profit order executed right when the coin rugged so then while it was in the process of completing, the stop loss order also triggered at the same time and resulted in 2 transactions.. Newbie mistake but for any newbies like me out there, only put 1 auto sell order, either take profit or sell profit or you can put both if the coin is well established.

Reddit,solana,Looking for Developer to Create Sniper Bot on Solana (Monitoring Instant Drops + Automatic Purchase),2025-02-03 21:07:50,"**Description**:  
I’m looking for a developer with experience in blockchain, preferably with knowledge of Solana and trading bot development, to create a custom sniper bot.

**What I need**:

* A bot that monitors the price of a specific token on Solana (the token I define) in **real time**.
* The bot must identify **instant price drops** relative to the **last recorded price**. For example, if the price drops **20% at once** (the percentage will be configurable by me), the bot should execute an **automatic purchase order** immediately after detecting the drop.
* **Important**: The 20% drop (or another defined percentage) must be **instantaneous**, meaning a sharp price drop, not a gradual decline that accumulates over time.
* The bot must be **extremely fast and efficient**, ensuring the purchase is made at the desired price without significant delays.
* It doesn’t need to operate 24/7 – I want to be able to manually **activate and deactivate** it whenever I want.
* The bot should operate on **only one token at a time**, as I define.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,solana,This is why 99% of Blockchains are complete crap nowadays.,2025-02-02 18:36:48,"No, im not talking about the price of tokens and all that, Im talking about why development of new products seems to have stalled out. Everything thats being released is a rehash of something else. I mean gd how many tamagotchi dapps do you need on one blockchain or snake clones etc...

Its because Devs get punished by the community when we talk about our projects. We are told we are shilling or advertising when we are looking for other devs to help out with some code, or to let them know, ""Hey, I have a tool to do that!""

And the fault is with the Blockchain and uneducated mods who cant tell the difference between a command line app and a trading bot...bot even joking

For instance, I created a post about a WIP solana project. Labeled it Dev. The goal was to try and find other devs to help finish it since its 50% complete and let people know the tool exists.

Its a debian/Ubuntu (I also have a mac apple script and win powershell version in the works) tool that lets devs create tokens on testnet and devnet on the fly with one click. It also walks you through how to create a DAO etc. It also allows devs to create protected tokens on mainnet to test out apps, but they come with a 99% buy, sell and trade tax unless the wallet holds the tax-free token/nft or if trading is done inside the devs app via the contract.

That feature is designed to prevent snipers from taking the $50-$100 in LP devs use when testing their product. I for instance lost 2500 just 2 days ago from bots auto buying the unlisted, unmarked test token I created.

Everytime I put any USDC or Solana in the LP to test their swap functions between their dApp's ecosystem and token, bots instantly sold everything they had, completely draining the pools. Then when it was low, more bots would buy. Rinse and repeat.

Between that and my client refusing to reimburse me as per our contract, ""Because thats just how its supposed to be.""  I cant even afford my rent now. So, I torched the code I wrote for my client and said if you dont pay for my services you dont get my code!

GG Mods. You pissed all over another dev who is trying to improve the Solana ecosystem. I dont even know how you think a Project that is 100% free and fully open-source (its a bash script so no encoded binaries) that is only 50% functional that is advertising.

 The entire thing is command line only. No gui, no web3 or anything like that. Again, purely designed for testing, the everyday user wouldn't know what to do with it. 

It just pisses me off that scammers can sit here post 100000 posts about bots, private groups, pump and dump discord/telegram channels, but they dont get their shit deleted 100% of the time.

Yet I spends hours and hours creating tool over 1k lines of bash script that is open-source, completely free and designed to help new devs just getting into the scene, hopefully to figure out away to get rid of the scammers the have destroyed Solana and yet im the yelled at for SELLING, ADVERTISING AND OFFERING SERVICES LIKE BOTS when my app is not even close to any of those. Im trying to combat bots and scammers.

Next time I hear people whining why no one ever develops anything to fight the bots and scammers, Im just gonna have them message the mods here and have them explain why devs cant talk about their projects they are creating to prevent that bullcrap

And to be clear, NO, POSTING A LINK TO A WIP PROJECT THAT IS 100% FREE IS NOT ADVERTISING because im not selling anything I dont have any projects I do sell. I'll say it again just in case you still haven't understood it's trying to attract other developers and to let the community know their developers working on solutions to the issues such as scammers and bots.

But GG guys, way to get rid of yet another Solana Dev. Now I get why 99% of all the other devs I know said solana isn't worth it, just a bunch of idiots, scammers and skids.

These people may have millions of followers on TikTok, YouTube, and/or Instagram.

They promote a meme coin on their X (Twitter) page, claiming it to be completely legit. However, these accounts will always be **barely used** and have **little to no followers** at all.

You'll usually see them post things at the beginning like ""supply locked"", ""dex paid"", or ""tokens burned"", in order to make the project seem more real.

The way they scam is by having separate wallets or usually **bundled** wallets containing a very large amount of tokens early on. These wallets will **gradually** sell, avoiding a big obvious rug pull (like hawktuah).

After all the wallets sell off their profit the creator will either slowly stop posting about it or quickly delete it to make it look like nothing ever happened.

Not enough people will be affected to make a commotion and hurt their reputation

TLDR;

Big influencers promote meme coins on Twitter accounts that have no followers to scam people and suffer no consequences because there won't be enough people affected or enough people to notice.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?

Reddit,ethereum,🚀 Major Update: Wanchain’s ETH XFlows Now Integrated with Polygon zkEVM! 🚀,2025-02-03 14:56:23,"https://preview.redd.it/mnxzuga2uxge1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=930d2fb712a78a211091fca9262c13d3acd8fdb9

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to encrypt data inside a smart contract on Ethereum?,2025-01-30 22:00:52,"Hello, everyone!

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

So, my question is: is there any way to encrypt data within Ethereum using another person's public key, whether with RSA, ECC, or some other approach? Has anything been developed to achieve this?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

# Issue:

* Funds are stuck, and Polymarket hasn’t returned them

# What I’ve Tried:

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

2. Any way to recover ETH from a centralized platform’s wallet if they don’t respond?
3. Is there any on-chain method to retrieve the funds, or does it depend entirely on Polymarket returning them?

Reddit,ethereum,Optimizing swapping fees with ETH?,2025-01-28 16:59:53,"I've been using Binance for a while, but comparing fees, the problem is that sending to my ledger once the transaction is over, is somewhat expensive (0.0012 ETH flat fee). On the bright side, for me sending USDT (TRC20) to Binance is free because I have enough TRX stacked to have free transactions.

So I wondered if there are better alternatives to swapping cryptos like USDT to ETH to send them to my ledger.

Generally, I like to swap around 200 USDT per month, but it's a ruin (including TRX fees with changelly), the total exchange cost, goes almost the same as Binance which happens to be expensive overall).

The thing is that it doesn't seem a good option overall for small transactions. But still, I'm trying to see which is the most convenient option to operate with ETH comfortably.

I left my job late last year to pursue this dream of becoming a blockchain dev or atleast start a career that is in the realm of cryptocurrency however I am concerned I am wasting my time, that the most basic of features and concepts are taking ""too long"" to comprehend and it is adding both mental stress and financial stress in my life.

Reddit,ethereum,New L2 Capable of supporting World's Population on Ethereum: Intmax,2025-01-27 05:46:19,"Anyone have thoughts or opinions on [Intmax](https://www.intmax.io/plasmanext)?  Found it reading through some of Vitalik's blog posts and has me wondering why I haven't started to invest some time into it. I mean, if Vitalik is posting alpha, why shouldn't I at least be a little curious?



Vitalik [describes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/17/futures2.html#5) it as a hybrid Plasma/Zk-Rollup that could bring us a short-cut to L2s with insane TPS while we continue through the roadmap. They claim they can do **80,000+ TPS.** Vitalik calculates their limit:


>These constructions put a very small amount of data per user onchain (eg. 5 bytes), and by doing so, get properties that are somewhere between plasma and rollups: in the Intmax case, you get a very high level of scalability and privacy, though even in the 16 MB world capacity is theoretically capped to roughly 16,000,000 / 12 / 5 = 266,667 TPS.


They claim they are the world's ""first Stateless Layer2 payment solution **with enough processing capacity to support the entire global population on Ethereum**""


>The platform delivers unprecedented scalability without compromising decentration, keeps transaction costs consistently below 0.5 cents regardless of network congestion, and offers strong privacy features through zero-knowledge proof systems. 


Reading through their [site blog](https://medium.com/intmax), it looks like they already have some interesting startups that appear to be progressing well. They have partnerships with a leading Japanese AI company and some Nigerian Banks



Intmax is currently in TestNet mode and has an option for you to operate on a network account and begin [mining](https://docs.network.intmax.io/faq-and-trouble-shooting) their token if you'd like to experience it first-hand.

Reddit,ethereum,Question about the difference between wBTC on Ethereum vs Cardano,2025-01-27 19:23:23,"Both Cardano and Ethereum allow Bitcoin to participate in DeFi ecosystems via Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC).

A key difference is in transaction fees: on Cardano, you can pay network fees using wBTC (so called ""babel fees""), whereas on Ethereum, fees must be paid in ETH. This flexibility on Cardano could be more user-friendly for those holding Bitcoin.

Aside from maybe lower transaction costs/scalability, which could make wBTC transactions more efficient and cost-effective on Cardano compared to Ethereum, are there any other advantages?

Short story short: What are main advantages of wBTC on Cardano, compared to Ethereum? Why would someone choose to wrap their BTC on Cardano instead of Ethereum?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,"Been 100% in for 7 years, when does it end?",2025-02-05 11:01:51,"So yeah as the title suggests I've been 100% allocated to Bitcoin for 7 years essentially.

The original goal was to make money so I didn't have to work anymore and retire early.

Well exceeded that goal, the funny thing is I can't bring myself to sell any of it because the more I've learned about Bitcoin and the traditional fiat debt slave inflationary system, the more I've realised that selling out of Bitcoin for fiat currencies or any other traditional asset is a losing game against inflation..

But when does it end? You can't earn a yield or an income from Bitcoin. You are sitting there with amazing numbers on the screen and still live like a peasant. I've considered selling up to 50% of my stack but obviously timing would be hard in this bull run. Ladder selling would be the best way.

I've run the numbers on selling Bitcoin and diversifying into other assets vs 100% holding Bitcoin and honestly nothing beats BTC.

If you earn even a 5% yield on another asset it still loses out to true inflation which is minimum 7% a year.

What do you guys think? It doesn't make sense to sell. But you gotta live your life too right? Otherwise what's the point?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

So despite encouraging support continuing for US governments willingness to explore a national BTC reserve, the markets are reacting negatively, also partly due to the current global trade tensions. 

  
nowadays, I think its becoming clear how any weak hands are in the game, Possibly due to modern society habitually chasing instant gratification. Realistically, this is bullish news, but the fact that nothing was mentioned to indicate that this is happening RIGHT THIS SECOND, people grow impatient and sell.

Just wanted to share a small but meaningful step in empowering the local community in Lesotho. During my medical humanitarian trip, I had the chance to help a longtime friend set up his Bitcoin wallet for his bar. He’s now the first business in the country to accept Bitcoin!

We started with Wallet of Satoshi (for ease of use) and a non-custodial Phoenix wallet (for self-sovereignty). Now that this first step is done, I’ll be focusing on onboarding more business owners and even running some courses for students. The average salary here is around $300, so giving people access to better financial tools could be life-changing.

Bitcoin isn’t just an investment here—it’s a way to bypass banking issues, store value, and eventually gain more financial independence. The goal is to make Bitcoin practical for everyday transactions.

Here’s a video of this first step: https://x.com/bitcoinlesotho/status/1887090632625459337?t=qNb6RYS5YD1TCHGNhs7lNQ&s=19

Seizing cash is straightforward for authorities, and the same applies to property because it's just a note in a public registry. The seizure of bank accounts is also relatively easy having the bank obey the authorities. But I'm curious how an individual is forced to provide his cryptocurrency's private keys. The authority can prove that a public address belongs to a suspected person but when asked for private keys to that person one can just say I forgot, I don't remember, it's not mine, etc... Most likely, such cases are resolved through a deal, in which the private keys are exchanged for a milder punishment.

This topic leads me to another question, although not very inherent to the main topic here: in the case of a BTC national reserve, Who would be responsible for holding the keys? I guess that at least it has to be a multi-sig 2 of 3 account, but who those 3 will be? Perhaps it would be better to entrust them to a custodial institution?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

So instead of maxing out the roth I've contemplated just doing half into it and half into bitcoin. But that takes me to my initial statement of what's the point if bitcoin is going to outperform said account so why not dump all I can into it. I guess the tax benefits of the roth is also something I think about. 

I'm just curious to hear what you guys think or do as far as traditional retirement accounts are concerned. Do you fund in addition to accumulating bitcoin? Do you do a certain allocation percentage? Or are you all in on bitcoin and don't bother with anything else.

Reddit,bitcoin,Question About Multi-Sig Wallet Setup with Unchained Using Ledger & Trezor,2025-02-05 18:03:31,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking into setting up a multi-sig vault with Unchained and could use some guidance. Right now, I have a Ledger wallet where I store Bitcoin. I’m planning to buy a Trezor wallet and use both devices as keys for my multi-sig setup.

Once the multi-sig is set up, I plan to move my Bitcoin from my Ledger wallet to the Unchained vault. My questions are:

  
1.	Do I need to first move my Bitcoin to a different address before I can use my existing Ledger wallet as one of the keys in the multi-sig setup? I want to confirm that it should be an issue to move Bitcoin after a multi-sig setup.  
  
2.	Can the same Ledger and Trezor wallets also be used as keys for another multi-sig wallet at the same time?

Appreciate any insights from those who have gone through this process. Thanks!",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

I dabble in P2P trading now and then and always come across big players who seem to have unlimited capital for buying BTC at around market price or just below and their profiles don't have any listings for selling BTC to other users. They only buy. How is this profitable for them?

I understand they might be playing a long-term game and accumulating BTC as an investment, but they can't all be doing that can they? For me, the whole point of P2P is to make some profit, ideally on a daily basis or as soon as funds end up in my wallet.

Are they selling anywhere else like exchanges? If so, how do they profit in that way, given the fees for moving BTC around and trading fees as well?

I’m super new to the game. I started buying on strike a few months ago and now have more money in bitcoin than I do fiat.

Are you all planning on holding onto your bitcoin til it theoretically is able to actually buy goods and services? And is that a main goal of the currency ultimately? Also what percentage of people out there do you think are just buying and selling in order to make fiat profits? Also have some of you sold some of your bitcoin for a fiat profit in order to purchase things but still are playing the long game and holding it for a distant future when it could be legal tender? Since I’m a lowly postman I just buy relatively small chunks every pay check and I’m treating it like a savings account for a loooong way down the road, but I sometimes find myself thinking what if it never becomes like legal tender?

My question is, would you pay the extra fee and interest payments and sell my BTC in December at the height of the bull run as opposed to April? Alternatively, I could stop buying Bitcoin during the parabolic phase and save USD for the tax bill and minimizing the December Sale.

I am Belgian and a novice. I am on both of these platforms currently to buy and hold Bitcoin. I know it's not optimal but I like how easy they are to use for a beginner like me.

However, I can't find out the bittack fees for each scheduled purchase? The fees on a purchase are very clear (1% from 250€ invested) but not clear on the schedule (rounding or weekly purchase). I know, however, that they do not charge fees when you withdraw your bitcoins to put them in your wallet (unlike some platforms). At the same time, Trade Republic only charges €1 for purchases and €0 for purchases, but you cannot take your Bitcoin out of the platform. So I'm wondering which of the two to invest in, knowing that I don't want to release them at the moment but perhaps one day I will find it essential...

In case the tax-exemption of bitcoins after a 1 year holding period is cancled, do you think it will change to a 10 year holding period, or will be cancled completly? I'm asking because I have a small amount of crypto, that will reach the 10 year holding period next year. I'm wondering if I should sell and rebuy them now to realise the profit now, while I don't have to pay taxes for it, or keep them, to benefit from the 10 year holding period later.

If i sell/rebuy them now, I will probably not reach the 10 year holding period before I want to sell them.

Cut losses or wait?,2025-02-05 21:20:41,"I entered the market in the 2021 bull run, split my portfolio roughly 50/50 between BTC and top 10 alts (you know the usual suspects). Held everything through the bear market (it sucked), hoping to sell at or above their ATH next cycle.

Now it's 4 years later and Bitcoin is well past its 2021 ATH, but most of my alts are still 70-80% down. Now it feels like the cycles has ended before it even started. At this point, I’m wondering if I should:

A) Salvage what’s left and rotate into BTC/stocks?

B) Hold out and hope they eventually recover

During the bear market I originally hoped for profit after 4 years, but that seems unlikely now.

What’s your strategy in this situation? Should I take the L and reallocate, or is there still hope for these coins to rebound?

Very safe bet. It performed less than ALGO now. Needless to say LINK surged like crazy after I sold it the first time and ALGO is now doing better than LINK. 

to sum it up. If you don't stick to your plan, you will loose. If you have no patience you will lose. If you switch back and forth you loose and pay extra fees every time. If you chase pumps you loose. I look at 2000 hard earned $ that are gone now. Learn from my mistakes.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,BTC Dominance,2025-02-05 09:38:32,"BTC & Chainlink are the only cryptos up in my portfolio. BTC average is around 63k. BTC is my second biggest holding after ETH. 

My alt bags are down heavily between 15%-60%. They were up a similar amount in November and I didn't take profits. 

Does it make sense to use extra cash to average up on BTC in 90-94k range or to cut losses on some of the alts until QT ends. Or just wait.

ETH bag is 17% down.. Literally bought some more ETH at the worst time before last weekend... I know. 

I treat BTC as an investment. The BTC I own is basically in an ETF (which I know, a lot of people on this sub will say what's the point if you don't have it on your own wallet?). I get that, I get the risks, but I came into BTC a lot later and I treat it as any other asset class. 

I'm planning to sell the BTC this bull cycle by the end of year. As well as selling all other cryptos too.

The question is: wait and hold the alt bags until QT ends. Who knows when this could happen, and alts could bleed a lot more until then. 

Or just cut some of the smaller losses alts and go all in on BTC. I haven't sold any BTC since I bought in August, so I would be averaging up. 

Anyone else in a similar situation as me? Too premature on the alt season? ",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Inverse Cramer? Last week, Cramer turned bullish on crypto and we saw the largest crypto liquidation within days",2025-02-05 01:21:08,"A week ago, Cramer was telling everyone to hold Bitcoin out of the blue: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ibw8mq/jim\_cramer\_says\_hold\_bitcoin\_not\_microstrategy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ibw8mq/jim_cramer_says_hold_bitcoin_not_microstrategy/)

Within days, BTC got to its lowest price of the year of 91.5k - which was close to a 3 month low since November of last year.

Altcoins got even more badly rekted, with many major alts losing close to 1/3 of their value on the daily chart. Shitcoins got rekted even worse.

This was the largest crypto liquidation ever (2 billion was wiped out), and this isn't the only major event Inverse Cramer has predicted. Let's look at other crazy accurate Inverse Cramer calls for each year which would have helped you to make a killing:

* Flipping totally bullish on BTC in 2021 at the 69k peak - that was also the crypto market peak for the cycle.
* After the FTX crash, screaming that Solana would go to zero when the price was at the bottom below $10 (if you bought then, 20-30x returns in less than 24 months)
* Being bearish on BTC and crypto just right before we had the run up to 100k late last year

When Cramer is bearish, we are rightfully bullish.

And when Cramer is bullish, I see comments always saying ""This time Inverse Cramer will fail"" - but heck the hopium always fails. Cramer shoots, and he will miss the target 100% of the time!

I'm convinced that the only reason that the Inverse Cramer ETF didn't take off is because he himself started buying the ETF in the first place.

How Inverse Cramer so accurate with such astonishing accuracy? What are your thoughts on this?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,How Movement is revolutionizing DeFi's scalability and security on Ethereum with Move.,2025-02-05 15:54:08,"Movement contributes to the scalability and security of DeFi applications on Ethereum through a number of technical and architectural innovations, primarily by integrating the Move programming language and its virtual machine (MoveVM) with Ethereum's liquidity and ecosystem.

  
Here are Movement's main contributions to the scalability and security of DeFi applications on Ethereum:

**Enhanced Security with Move:**

* Resource-Oriented Programming: The Move language uses a resource-oriented programming model, where digital assets are managed as resources with strict rules about their creation and transfer. This significantly reduces common vulnerabilities in Solidity, such as re-entry, overflows, and underflows.
* Formal Verification: Move includes Move Prover, a formal verification tool that mathematically analyzes code to ensure correctness and detect vulnerabilities before execution. This process provides a higher level of security than Solidity, where vulnerabilities are common and have resulted in billions of dollars in losses.
* Common Attack Prevention: Move is designed to inherently prevent common attacks on Solidity, providing an additional layer of security for DeFi applications.

**Escalabilidad a Través de la Paralelización:**

* Block-STM Engine: The MoveVM implements Block-STM, a parallel execution engine that allows multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously. This results in higher throughput and scalability, reaching up to 180,000 TPS, compared to the limitations of the EVM. The ability to execute transactions in parallel is crucial for DeFi applications that require high throughput and low latency.
* App-Specific Rollups: Movement allows the creation of application-specific rollups, isolating the transactions of one application from others on the network. This avoids congestion and bottlenecks, allowing high-activity DeFi applications (such as gaming and trading) to operate without affecting the performance of other applications on the same network.

**Interoperability and Liquidity:**

* EVM support - Movement offers EVM support through the Fractal interpreter, allowing developers to deploy existing Solidity contracts on MoveVM. This makes it easy to migrate Ethereum DeFi applications to Movement without rewriting code, preserving the original logic and functionality and leveraging Move's security. In addition, Movement connects the MoveVM and Ethereum ecosystems, allowing applications to run on multiple blockchains.
* Liquidity Access: Movement enables DeFi applications to access liquidity in both Ethereum and the Move ecosystem. By connecting to these two worlds, DeFi apps can take advantage of existing liquidity in Ethereum, while benefiting from the security and performance of Move.
* Secure Bridges: Movement uses an Ethereum JSON RPC endpoint to process EVM requests and convert them into MoveVM-compliant calls, eliminating the need for third-party bridges and their associated vulnerabilities.

**Modular and Customizable Infrastructure:**

* Move Stack: Movement uses a modular architecture called Move Stack that allows developers to choose the most appropriate components for their applications, such as sequencers, data availability and settlement mechanisms. This modularity allows developers to optimize the performance, cost and security of their DeFi applications.
* Decentralized Shared Sequencer (DSS): Movement uses a shared decentralized sequencer that improves censorship resistance and reliability. The DSS facilitates atomic transactions between chains and shared liquidity between rollups, improving the efficiency and security of the ecosystem.

**Examples of DeFi applications in Movement:**

* VCRED: An AI-enhanced liquidity management platform, uses Movement to increase capital efficiency by up to 160x. VCRED leverages the security of Move and the scalability of Movement to optimize staking strategies and deliver better returns.
* Meridian and Echelon: Lending protocols that have raised capital and are building in the Movement ecosystem.
* Raga Finance: A platform for managing assets in a multi-chain world, offering native yields and secure transactions.

Movement not only provides a more secure environment for DeFi applications through the Move language, but also improves scalability through parallelization and modular architecture. The combination of security, performance and EVM compatibility make Movement a promising solution to drive growth and innovation in the DeFi space on Ethereum.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

For anyone not familiar with them, a major service they provide is allowing people to remit money with relative ease, especially in underbanked or under-served communities. To me their business represents a huge area that crypto solves.  

If we all knew how to store and use crypto overnight their business wouldn’t be necessary. However, they are much simpler than crypto, and I think they fill a niche that will always exist. I don’t often listen to their earnings calls, but someone essentially asked how they will deal with competition from things such as cryptocurrency.  

Their response was effectively that they are exploring ways to legally and effectively settle funds via crypto. This will reduce float in the system, and speed up inefficiencies of using the traditional swift based banking system to move money and settle transactions. Those are their words. The answer was very well thought out IMO and it makes me excited.  

It could very well be that this particular company doesn’t figure out how to implement this, but I see them as a dinosaur company, and the fact that they are interested in this is just nice to hear I guess.

At the beginning it seemed that Cryptocurrencies could be a place where even us poors could compete with the rich and make a lot of money. Now it looks like it has become another instrument for them to transfer money from the middle class to the upper class. This recent events aren't the natural ebb and flow of the market, but a deliberate attack to bankrupt small investors and newbies.

Do you think the crypto space will be different in a few years? Will it be an upper class only space? Where do the small fish go in this pond? Are we all gonna get eaten alive by sharks?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Lost bnb,2025-02-05 19:49:55,"Hello everyone 👋

I have a question that I can't quite figure out and I’m hoping someone can help me out. Recently, I transferred 0.4 BNB from Bilaxy Exchange to Bybit Exchange. Unfortunately, I haven’t received this amount in my Bybit account. 😕

After contacting Bybit, I was told that the transaction was sent via the wrong chain (ETH) and that they can’t do anything about it. The funds would therefore be lost. But when I looked further into the transaction (a couple weeks later), I noticed that the 0.4 BNB was subsequently transferred again to another adres. 🤔

How is this possible? Am I being fooled by Bybit? Or is there something else going on that I haven’t considered? I’m curious if anyone has experience with something like this or has tips on what I should do now.

Thanks in advance for your help! 🙏

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,At what point do you walk away? Would not being close to cutting even to losing your life savings after 5 years be it?,2025-02-05 21:34:31,"I've been with Crypto for a while, but I never have gotten into meme coins or anything like that. I remember BTC at 8k, that sorta time around in 2020. 

That was when I first intially bought. I threw a few thousand in, said whatever. I made a lot back, and yes I took some profit and I have taken some profit. I don't keep record of it. 

When 2021 came, I got caught in the Luna craze and through 15k into it. That was my life savings. Yes. I know that was stupid. From my memory I took the crypto I had pulled out right before Celsius crashed into BTC and ETH, maybe some polygon and called it quits for a while.

I am  in a few other alts, AVAX is one. I recently put a few more thousand into AVAX at $6 a year ago, its been nice and a week or two ago I was JUST at cutting even at making my entire life savings lost back.

At what point, is this the point where I cut even and just walk away?

I put more into Chainlink when it hit $16 two days ago and I got this feeling I was at the roulette machine again. Instead of $20s, it's now thousands. Sure, I'm actually not a loss over the years. I never have sold the Luna that crashed, it just sits there, and now everytime I do my taxes I'm always reminded I'm still thousands down.

It helps me not pay taxes on my crypto gains, but also it's a reminder that even after 5 years I'm not even. And if we get another top, I can say I got out with no money lost. But it's like, 5 years for that? Just coming out where I started? Does that make me an idiot? The amount of time lost, time spent researching projects and buying into this whole thing, thinking it was the future?

Not just that, I learned since Luna, I only buy coins with capped max supplies, usually only US based cryptos, and stick to that. That is called learning from your mistakes. So it's like, do I make a decision to cut even or keep grinding? Is crypto trying to tell me I'm a loser after 5 years, what's the point if you are barely where you started?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"As Bitcoin becomes a tool of institutions and governments, the time to get rich in crypto is over - true or false?",2025-02-04 22:28:32,"People tend to look at previous bull runs to predict the current bull run. And going by that logic, we are only at the beginning. BTC should at least go to 150k, ETH has been far below expectations and alt season is nowhere to be found. That's why everyone believes that the big gains are still to come.

But what if something significant happened since 2020? Something that makes this bull run and every future bull run very different from the previous ones? 

I can't pin-point it and I don't have the evidence. But I think there has been a major shift between 2020 and 2025. It feels like in every previous bull run, it was mostly private individuals that were investing and fighting against each other to time the best point to take profits and get out. But ever since 2020, the richest people and institutions in the world have started to take crypto seriously, because they saw how much money one can make, and that it does happen repeatedly in cycles.

This might change the dynamic of how the entire crypto market works. The crypto market swings in whichever direction BTC goes, and the people who can influence BTC the most are the ones with the most money and the most insider knowledge. Yes, this has always been the case. But I feel like the big new investors (which are literally the most powerful forces on the planet) have these resources available to such an amount, that it dwarfs even the other conventional whales.

If such investors and institutions have the power to manipulate the BTC course at will, why do you still think that another BTC rise to 150k - 180k will come? They can just dump BTC by 10k and make you FUD out, then buy your lost coins, pump it till you are optimistic enough to invest again, and repeat this spiel indefinitely.

No more super crashes that make you pull out entirely. Just regular dumps that just keep you on the edge of hoping that the next retrace will be different. And very slowly but steadily, more and more crypto will travel from the average joe's wallet to the richest.

Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but this feels nothing like 2020 or 2017. It feels like this time, crypto has become so influential that it attracted the institutions that are powerful enough to rig the system. What do you think?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Recently, I had a post pop-up about user having BTC deposited to their wallet and obviously it was bullshit. I commented as much. Out of curiosity I decided to check my old AW account.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Reddit,crypto,Probability of randomly generating an EC public key,2025-01-29 15:06:22,"From what I understand the size of a secp256k1 EC public key is 65 bytes (out of which one is a prefix byte so lets ignore that). The private key is any 256-bit number in [0, N] where N is the order of the curve. So if I have a random 64-byte stream, the probability of it being a valid EC public key on the curve is `N / 2^512 = 2^256 / 2^512 = 2^{-256}`. Does this sound right?

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"". So then how would I find the probabilty of a random 32-byte stream being a valid EC public key on the (secp256k1) curve? Does the probability remain the same?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

It then says that:

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Reddit,crypto,Ciphered file,2024-12-05 19:03:13,"Hello everyone.

Im relatively in the cryptography field and im facing a problem for wich i cant find a solution.  
I have recieved some homeworks at my university where they gave me a ciphered file and some clues to get the password. I think I have the pass or atleast i have the bases to find the real one but muy problem is that i dont actually know what cipher method is used so i have no way to apply the password, wich haves one of the next forms:  
1CCD8A4  
1CCD8A41CCD8A4  
1CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A41CCD8A4  
or the same ones but with lowercases.

Is there any way to know wich cypher is being used? or is there any way to set a password to a file so it opens deciphered?

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

  
Thanks! (:",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566
Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

    # NOTE: No concerns are made for timing safety
    # These two functions are just plain CTR mode with key commitment enhancement

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-02-06 00:52:31.496566

Reddit,crypto,Scheme for long lived auth,2024-11-24 13:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.
