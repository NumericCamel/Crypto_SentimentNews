This recovery going into the new month plays into the high expectations for the meme coin, especially in Q4, when the altcoin’s price is expected to more than double. Using historical data, this report elaborates on why the expectations for the Shiba Inu price are high going into the last quarter of the year 2024. The Most Bullish Month Of The Year For Shiba Inu According to historical performance, the end of September is about to usher in the most bullish quarter of the year 2024 for Shiba Inu. This is especially true for the month of October which has never ended in the red for the meme coin. If this trend holds, then the SHIB price could continue to rise from here. Related Reading: ETH Rally Pushes Profitability To Nearly 70%: More To Come This Week? Data from the CryptoRank website shows that the Shiba Inu price has seen an average return of +283.4% in the month of October. This average return could mean that the Shiba Inu price could triple by the time the month of October is over. Such a rise would put the SHIB price around the $0.00006 level this month. Additionally, if the recovery continues through the end of the year as expected, then the meme coin’s price could be seeing a new all-time high price before the year is over. Also, the last time that SHIB ended the month of September in the green was 2021, and the month of October went on to see an 833% increase in the space of one month. Now, 2024 is about to be the first in three years when the SHIB price is ending in the green again. A repeat of the 2021 trend would also send SHIB toward a new all-time high. Will Q4 End In Green Or Red? While the crypto market has often seen a good turn in Q4, the Shiba Inu price has not been very lucky after the month of October. According to CryptoRank, the average returns for November and December are in the negative with -15.9% and -6.12%, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Could Catapult Price To New All-Time High – Here’s Why This doesn’t bode well for the Shiba Inu price and could suggest a good time to sell for investors. If this follows, then October could be a good time to move out of the altcoin and move back in in December. However, if the Bitcoin uptrend continues into the end of the year, it could see the SHIB price rise into the new year.

Bradford’s Bullish Take On BTC Price In an interview with research and brokerage firm Bernstein, CleanSpark’s CEO noted that historically, post-halving periods have led to several positive adjustments for BTC’s price.  It should be recalled that Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving in April 2024, when its block confirmation rewards were slashed from 6.250 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In a note to clients shared today, Bradford remarked: Based on my current analysis, I believe we could see bitcoin peak just under $200,000, sometime in the next 18 months. That’ll likely be a peak. But I do think we’ll see a rapid jump, and then hopefully, an extended elongated period of it being up before we revisit a bear cycle. Related Reading: Historical Trends Put Bitcoin At $400,000 With Shocking Timeline Bradford stressed that he sees Bitcoin’s “extended flat period” as a positive sign. It indicates that a sustained rally to the upside may last longer than usual. However, he cautions that this depends on macroeconomic events and other relevant factors. Adding to his comments, Bradford said he expects a considerable push in BTC price post-election through January 2025. Subsequently, this could help Bitcoin miners with efficient cost structures expand their profit margins. Interestingly, the CleanSpark CEO doesn’t think it’s important who wins the US presidential elections in November 2024. Rather, the reduction in electoral uncertainty after the elections will help investors place more confidence in risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. Bradford opined that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) was late in cutting interest rates after hiking them over the past two years. He concluded that to correct its delayed action, the Fed might cut rates more aggressively in the next 15 to 16 months, leading to further BTC price appreciation. Bitcoin Price Looks For Further Upside, But Challenges Remain After hitting a low of nearly $53,900 on September 6, Bitcoin has rebounded by nearly 10% on the back of multiple positive developments, such as the Fed cutting interest rates by 50 basis points (bps), and increased net daily inflows to ETFs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Biggest September Gains In A Decade: Here’s Why Crypto analysts believe that there is room for further upside in Bitcoin price. For instance, analysts from 10x Research predict that BTC may reach $70,000 in the coming two weeks, followed by a new all-time high (ATH) price. However, there are reasons to temper this optimism. For example, the recent Bitcoin rally has been accompanied by a rapid increase in open interest, indicating the possibility of high price volatility in the near term. Similarly, another analyst highlighted the greater increase in derivatives trading compared to spot trading as a cause for concern regarding a healthy Bitcoin price trajectory to the upside. Bitcoin trades at $63,710 at press time, down 3.2% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart Tradingview.com",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Faces Network Shakeup: These Key Trends Point to Market Shifts,2024-09-30 20:30:59+00:00,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently shown signs of a shifting market sentiment and momentum, according to an analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst named Percival. The analyst disclosed that various market conditions and technological developments have impacted Ethereum’s momentum and have led to mixed views on its future growth trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Trims Gains: Is the Rally Losing Steam? Ethereum’s Market Sees Shift Percival, highlighted that Ethereum has faced a decline in activity due to the rise of other blockchains with greater accessibility, more advanced technology, and faster update cycles. According to the analyst, “the positive Momentum sentiment is far below expectations.” So far, the open interest in Ethereum futures—a measure of capital flowing into derivative contracts—reached $9.2 billion, with a notable inflow of $2.12 billion in August 2024. This represents a 30% rise but pales compared to the $6 billion inflow observed between April and May, reflecting only half of that previous momentum. Another major observation of the analysis was the “Coinbase Premium Gap,” indicating the differential between the price of Ethereum on Coinbase and other global exchanges. A slowdown in selling pressure from US-based investors suggests a possible positive shift in market sentiment. However, the market is still waiting for a significant influx of capital to drive a strong rally for Ethereum. The analyst pointed out that any future price recovery would depend on substantial investment inflows, which have yet to materialize. Furthermore, after the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) announcements, Ethereum’s gas fees surged, hinting at a possible shift of capital from traditional treasuries into decentralized finance (DeFi). The analyst mentioned an instance: the DeFi lending platform Aave, which operates on the ETH network, has seen a moderate rise in fee collection, from $42 million in March to $43 million in August. Ethereum Network Lags Behind While Percival noted that from an economic perspective, Ethereum needs to revert to its max fee pass gas mean, aligning its growth with its intrinsic value, the analyst also suggests that Ethereum currently faces several internal gaps. Although the technology ecosystem around Ethereum is expanding, the network seems to be lagging behind the competition, according to Percival. The CryptoQuant analyst reveals that this disconnect between Ethereum’s capabilities and its technological rivals has led to a significant shortfall in investment. Moreover, the limited inflow of small capital and lack of consistent use suggest that even minor investments are not being sustained over time. Related Reading: Ethereum Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Is Rising Again — What It Means For ETH Price The analyst’s take is further validated by the fact that Ethereum’s network has faced increased competition from alternative blockchains like Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and others that boast higher transaction speeds and lower fees.

Driven by its recent bullish momentum, XRP has succeeded in breaking a key bullish pattern, as a result, a crypto analyst has predicted that it could potentially jump 4X to new highs of $2.6.  XRP Price Set Sights On Midterm Target At $2.3 After experiencing slow growth and bearish momentum in the past few weeks, XRP has sparked renewed confidence amongst investors with its latest price surge. Over the last seven days, XRP has skyrocketed by 8.93% and is showing signs of more gains in the future.  Related Reading: PEPE Confirms Breakout From Symmetrical Triangle: How Far Can It Go? This bullish outlook is shared by prominent crypto analyst, Captain Faibik, who disclosed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on September 28, that XRP has just broken a unique bullish pattern, indicating a potential for a major price rally.  In Faibik’s XRP price chart, a multi-year bullish symmetrical triangle pattern can be seen. This triangle pattern began forming in October 2021 and has extended through to September 2024, with XRP undergoing significant price fluctuations throughout this period.  After experiencing its first substantial price surge in weeks, XRP successfully broke out of this bullish triangle pattern. The extent of XRP’s recent price increase is evident in CoinMarketCap’s data, which indicates that the cryptocurrency has jumped by 4.73% in the last 24 hours.  This significant price increase suggests that XRP may be aiming to push significantly above its previous consolidation levels of around $0.5. As of writing, XRP is trading at $0.64, underscoring a possible rise in investor interest and demand for the cryptocurrency.  By breaking out of this bullish triangle pattern, Faibik believes that XRP could be on track for a massive rally that could push its price by 4X. The analyst has declared that XRP is currently heating up for a massive breakout to mid-term targets at $2.3.  XRP Breaks Critical Trendline A crypto and Elliott Wave analyst, identified as ‘XForceGlobal’ on X has highlighted a unique trendline in XRP’s price chart. According to the analyst, XRP has just broken the “multilayer BD trendline,’ and may be heading towards a price increase.  Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC Battle Far From Over As Regulator Opposes Court’s Decision XForceGlobal has suggested that if XRP can maintain a price above this trendline for a few more weeks, it could witness a price increase between $7 to $10.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"EigenLayer Founder Reiterates Support For Ethereum, Why Is ETH Struggling?",2024-09-30 17:30:26+00:00,"Despite scalability and high gas fees facing Ethereum, the founder of EigenLayer, a liquidity restaking platform, insists the network is superior, especially against Solana. Solana is the third most valuable smart contracts platform, trailing Ethereum and the BNB Chain. Over the years since launching, it has been gulping up more market share from Ethereum, cementing its position. Is Ethereum Superior To Solana? While the prominence of Solana is evident, Sreeram Kannan, the founder of EigenLayer, argued in a post on X that Solana prioritizes low latency and global node synchronization over other core features. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Could Go Parabolic’ Once It Breaks $200 Resistance – Analyst On the other hand, Ethereum took a different approach, emphasizing the need for stability and decentralization. Accordingly, in Kannan’s view, the first smart contracts platform offers a more comprehensive solution than its competitor. Currently, EigenLayer manages over $12 billion worth of assets on Ethereum, according to DeFiLlama. Although Kannan acknowledges the efficiency of Solana, the founder nonetheless picks out some limitations now that the platform is building a global state machine. At the top of the list is the blockchain’s sacrifice of programmability and verifiability.   Meanwhile, the EigenLayer lead thinks Ethereum is excelling, especially on performance, thanks in part to the success of rollups and the resulting wild adoption. This off-chain solution provides instant confirmation and is more performant than web2 applications. At the same time, Ethereum is programmable, enabling EigenLayer to add more features like an arbitrary decentralization of verifiable tasks. As a result, the liquidity restaking platform, Kannan adds, has enabled cloud-scale programmability. Layer-2 Platforms Thriving: Why Is ETH Struggling? The co-founder of Celestia, Mustafa Al-Bassam, also appreciates what Ethereum brings to the table and is absent or underdeveloped in other networks. In a post on X, Al-Bassam said the first smart contracts platform is “underrated.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets 81% In One Day, Are The Bulls Back? Specifically, the co-founder lauded the thriving rollup ecosystem in Ethereum, saying it is “by far the largest and most successful.” As of September 30, L2Beat data shows that the layer-2 ecosystem in Ethereum manages over $38 billion, with Arbitrum and Base among the largest platforms. Even as Base and other Ethereum layer-2 platforms draw activity, ETH, the native currency, is struggling for momentum. The daily chart shows bulls have yet to break above $2,800, although support remains at $2,400. Dwindling upside momentum has been partly blamed on the proliferation of layer-2 scaling solutions. The network becomes inflationary as more activity is re-routed off-chain, and enhancements like Dencun are activated to make layer-2 transactions even cheaper.

In his latest video, Pal, who has long advocated for an understanding of what he calls the “exponential age,” claims that the coming years will bring about the largest changes humanity has ever experienced, due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. According to Pal, we are nearing what he terms the “economic singularity,” a point beyond which current economic, market, and business frameworks will no longer be applicable. “By about 2030, things are going to become not understandable by using the existing frameworks of economics, financial analysis, markets, and that kind of stuff,” Pal explains. Pal He asserts that AI and robotics are advancing at a pace that will soon outstrip human capacity to adapt under current economic systems. Falling birth rates and aging populations across developed nations are leading to a decline in the traditional economic drivers of GDP growth. Moreover, Pal notes that productivity has not kept up with technological capability, and most new debt is simply servicing old debts, not creating new economic value. Related Reading: Grayscale’s Bullish Forecast: The Top 20 Crypto To Watch In Q4 The most significant aspect of Pal’s warning concerns the role of AI in the economy. He believes that AI will reach and surpass human levels of intelligence across all areas of knowledge, fundamentally altering the landscape of labor and productivity. “AI is basically infinite human knowledge now […] As these models scale, the breakthroughs come through, and the average IQ of AI goes from 100 to 400, and then on to a million times the intelligence of a human,” Pal states. This immense growth in AI capabilities is expected to lead to what Pal describes as infinite productivity and a near-zero marginal cost of electricity, primarily due to advances in renewable energy technologies. He argues that these factors will lead to massive deflationary pressures as goods and services become increasingly inexpensive to produce. The Key Role Of Crypto Pal is particularly bullish on the transformative power of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in this context. He describes a future economic model where “AI agents” perform tasks and transact autonomously using cryptocurrencies, given their ability to operate independently of traditional banking systems. Related Reading: VP Kamala Harris’s First Speech On Crypto Sparks 7% Rise In This Memecoin “Obviously, we’ll probably need crypto payments to pay you. […] I think we’ll use cryptocurrency to do that because last thing I checked, AI can’t get a bank account – it’s never going to transfer money over SWIFT, never going to happen,” Pal remarks. Pal urges viewers to recognize the urgency of investing in cryptocurrencies. He advises that the window for capitalizing on these technologies is closing fast, with only about six years left to make substantial gains before traditional economic and market structures transform irreversibly. “We’re going to have to go through this together and we have to be smart and try and figure it out as we go but I do know that this idea of 6 years to make as much money as possible is really important and I do think that the real answer to this, as far as I can see, is cryptocurrency because it is the best performing asset in the world and of all time. So I think that’s the one thing we can lean in, it has a huge future,” Pal says. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $63,588.

This has led to a large stash of BTC by these issuers as BlackRock leads the charge. Given their buying spree so far, the number of BTC being held by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been rising and is almost at the 1 million mark, Spot Bitcoin ETFs Now Hold 924,768 BTC The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a total of 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading back in January 2024.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,BNB Rally Fades As Price Dips Under $600: Is A Correction Looming?,2024-09-30 13:00:57+00:00,"BNB‘s recent rally appears to be losing steam, as the price has dipped below the crucial $600 mark. After a strong upward surge that reignited bullish sentiment, the momentum is now showing signs of cooling off. This dip raises concerns about whether the rally can sustain itself or if a broader correction is on the horizon. As selling pressure increases and the market cools, this article seeks to explore whether BNB’s rally is losing steam after dipping below the key $600 level. By analyzing technical indicators, market sentiment, and price action, we aim to evaluate the potential for a deeper correction or a renewed bullish push. Current Market Conditions: Analyzing The Position Of BNB Recently, BNB has taken a bearish turn on the 4-hour chart after struggling to break above the significant resistance level of $605. This failure to maintain upward movement has led to a decline, bringing the asset down to the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Furthermore, a breach below this moving average could intensify selling pressure, while a bounce back might indicate a possible reversal. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests bullish momentum may wane. Currently, the RSI has fallen to around 36%, indicating that the buying pressure is diminishing. An RSI below 40 can signal that an asset is entering oversold territory, which often precedes further declines or the possibility of a price correction. Related Reading: BNB Price Surge Eyes $550 Breakout: Can It Push Higher? Also, on the daily chart, BNB is exhibiting significant negative movement, as reflected by a series of bearish candlesticks. This ongoing downward trend highlights a prevailing selling pressure within the market. Although BNB is currently trading above the 100-day SMA, which is typically seen as a bullish indicator, the strength of the bearish candlesticks suggests that upward momentum may be limited. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a closer examination of the RSI formation reveals that the RSI signal line has dipped to 53%, approaching the crucial 50% threshold. As the RSI approaches this level, it may heighten the risk of additional declines if it falls below 50, reinforcing the bearish sentiment in the market. Will The 100-Day SMA Hold? Currently, BNB is trading just above the 100-day SMA, which has historically served as a strong indicator of market sentiment. If the price breaks below the 100-day SMA, it could trigger increased selling pressure, leading to an extended drop toward the $531 support level. Related Reading: BNB Price Struggles to Hold $500: Is a Breakout Coming? In the event that BNB maintains its position above the 100-day SMA, it may indicate a potential rebound and restore bullish sentiment, allowing the price to begin climbing back toward the $605 resistance level. A successful breakout above this mark could pave the way for more price growth toward other resistance levels, increasing optimism among traders and signaling a more sustained upward trend.

Reddit,solana,Player pumps player memecoins ,2024-09-30 21:52:08,"Who’s building this? I have a few ideas. 

One of them, 


Memecoins are solely created with the motive of merging with other memecoins and garnering a bigger community. 
Every memecoin bonded on the platform will be deployed on raydium with 500k in liquidity. 

Memecoins merge with other memecoins. 
Communities merge with other communities. 
Bigger cult. Bigger pump. 

Memecoins are created in tranches, each memecoin has to reach a threshold to merge with other ones.
Everytime a memecoin is created a parallel telegram chat is spawned. 
Everytime a memecoin is about to merge. A new telegram chat is formed with a new name. Where community members are redirected and can now chat. Increasing the size of the community and number of holders. 
The name can be bid on by the community and names can be decided on the fly. Community V community. 

Once a memecoin reaches a threshold supply is added for more buyers to come in. 
It repeats itself till we have 500k in mc.

Reddit,solana,Blockchain Vending Platform powered by Solana,2024-10-01 00:17:27,"Hey Solana Community,

I'm Will Okojie, co-founder of chebeMCHN, and I wanted to share something that’s been in the works for a while now. We’re building a smart vending platform that goes beyond just convenience — we’re leveraging the power of the Solana ecosystem to completely reimagine how vending machines operate. 🚀

Our vision? Imagine walking up to a vending machine, paying with your favorite stablecoins, and getting more than just a snack or a drink — you get an NFT receipt tied to your purchase, unlocking rewards, discounts, and some pretty cool perks down the line. 🌟 Not only that, but we’re aiming to integrate loyalty programs where members can actually earn from staking the funds we keep on-chain. It’s about giving back to the community and creating a platform that’s rewarding in more ways than one.

We’ve launched our first machine in Denver and are rolling out new locations soon, and we’re pumped to start integrating Solana’s fast, secure, and low-cost network to make all this possible.

It’s still early days for us, but Solana’s tech is giving us the flexibility to offer everything from stablecoin payments to NFTs and staking rewards—all through a vending machine! Who would’ve thought?

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any advice as we work toward bringing this project to life. Excited to be part of this community and can’t wait to see where this journey with Solana takes us.

Reddit,solana,SOL RPC Nodes Management Tools,2024-09-30 10:10:15,"Hey, Solana Fam!  
Today I’d like to tell you how to manage your RPC nodes to get the best performance and the lowest downtimes possible. We will take the GetBlock RPC node provider as an example as they support *SOL RPC nodes* on Mainnet and Testnet. We are gonna learn how they manage their high-speed RPC, and discover some services for node management, handy tools, tips, and tricks  
Let’s jump right into it!

***How GetBlock - RPC Provider Works***

When running an RPC node it’s crucial to be always aware of the consistency and availability of your node. To do so, you have to utilize some robust management and monitoring tools. Here’s an example of the tools GetBlock is using:

* Prometheus open-source monitoring system
* Grafana observability platform; (the latter sources data from the first one.)
* The health sidecar
* Alertmanager service in Slack
* Loadservice
* Auto-switching system

Prometheus gathers metrics and databases to display in Grafana. Prometheus is also bonded to Alertmanager service to inform the team in Slack about all events regarding infrastructure status. The health sidecar helps GetBlock monitor the current height and health of the nodes. To get immediate notifications from the monitoring tool GetBlock connected it to the Alertmanager service in Slack. It helps to get the fastest notification if some issue occurs and always double-check when it’s resolved. The health sidecar is also connected to the auto-switching system. So if the block deviation occurs, the unhealthy node is instantly switched to a healthy one. Last but not least, the node must be updated to the latest versions. This way GetBlock constantly monitors blockchains’ GitHub repositories and social media to find out about the upcoming updates first in hand.  
**All of that helps GetBlock to reach the highest node availability of 99%!**

If you don’t wanna experience all the hustles associated with running and maintaining your own SOL RPC node. You can simply connect to RPC nodes for 50+ blockchains with GetBlock. It’s now even available with 30% OFF your first shared node subscription.",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915
Reddit,solana,How ​​to properly create meme coins and ensure fair profits as a developer,2024-09-30 14:40:08,"Hello,

I am creating a small team to develop my well-structured idea for a meme coin. We have allocated some SOL for the LP and for the development of the website, graphics, etc.

Theoretically, the idea could generate profits, but I want to make sure that I can withdraw my money fairly and keep the project active, ensuring that the team also receives its benefits.

If I lock up 90% of the LP, how can I withdraw the remaining 10% for myself and the investors? Are there other ways to divide the LP that you would recommend?

Reddit,solana,Why you must go to Breakpoint!,2024-09-27 08:03:25,"I just got back from Token2049 / Breakpoint in Singapore a few days ago, and honestly, if you're even slightly into Solana or the broader crypto space, you have to go. It was my first time hitting up a major event like this, and as a designer within web3, I didn’t realize how crucial these in-person events are for really getting plugged into the community. 

I skipped the main Token2049 conference (slight fomo), but the real magic was in the side events and Breakpoint. There were meetups and parties happening all over Singapore, from rooftop bars to hawker centers, and that’s where I got to really connect with the Solana crowd. It wasn’t just about making contacts—it was about feeling the energy of the ecosystem. You could be grabbing drinks and end up in a deep convo with someone from Phantom, Solana, or Jupiter. It’s surreal when you realize you’re chatting with people who are building the stuff you use every day.

What made it even better? The whole city was buzzing because Formula 1 was happening at the same time. Crypto + F1 fans everywhere made it feel like Singapore was the place to be. The vibe was so open, too—everyone’s there to share ideas, swap stories, and just genuinely connect. It didn’t feel forced at all. I met so many people from different projects and protocols. Putting faces to the PFPs and building real relationships was the best part.

If you’re a Solana fan, Breakpoint was next-level. Solana’s ecosystem has this unique energy to it that’s hard to explain until you’re actually in the room with the people behind it. The talks were solid, with Toly and the team laying out big visions, especially for mobile. The best part, though, was how easy it was to connect with others. Everything was in one venue, so you could jump from talks to grabbing coffee with the Solana dev you just met, without missing a beat.

The after-parties were, of course, insane. Shoutout to Solana and Solflare for organizing an epic one—think massive warehouse, food trucks, DJs, airdrops flying around, and even a giant inflatable Bonk mascot outside. These aren’t just parties—they’re prime networking opportunities where you can get to know people in a chill, fun setting.

For me, the big takeaway was this: if you want to get in tune with the Solana community (or crypto in general), events like these are a must. You can read all the threads and hop on all the calls you want, but nothing beats in-person convos for building real relationships. Plus, the Solana ecosystem is growing fast, and being there, you can feel the momentum behind it. Whether you’re a dev, an investor, or just a fan, being part of this community in person is next-level.

So yeah, if you ever get the chance, make sure to hit up Breakpoint, or any other big Solana event. You’ll walk away with real connections, fresh insights, and a whole lot of inspiration. Plus, you know, maybe a few free drinks and some killer swag. 

See you all Abu Dhabi 2025! LFG!

Breakpoint has come to a close, and sadly I was watching along from home feeling some serious FOMO!

The biggest note from this year's Breakpoint was a focus on products vs. infrastructure/tooling. Don't worry, there were plenty of goodies for devs too!

Some of the main themes, as noted by [0xrwu of Tensor](https://x.com/0xrwu/status/1838202305713242319?ref=blog.colosseum.org), were cross-chain swaps, stablecoins & payments, embedded wallets, and DePIN. There was also a lot of big news around Mobile and real-world apps. 

Overall, the sentiment around Breakpoint is excitement about the future of Solana!

Here's the rest of the news for Solana developers…

### 🌟 Metaplex Aura

Metaplex has launched Aura, a decentralized indexing and data availability network designed to extend the Solana ecosystem and SVM.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4xzkja681ard1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f886e329c0402ff612cf44679b6e0a84906920)

Aura provides developers with enhanced tools for building dApps by solving key challenges like data retrieval and scalability.

Aura is powered by $MPLX and operates through a network of decentralized nodes that handle indexing and data storage in real-time.

It features three core components:

1. **Data Availability for Digital Assets:** Ensures that assets and media are accessible at all times, even when compressed, using decentralized storage solutions to eliminate reliance on a single point of failure.
2. **Multi-Program Consistent Indexing:** Offers high-performance indexing across the Solana network and SVM, improving how data is retrieved and displayed across multiple programs.
3. **Elastic State Management:** Developers can compress and decompress asset data efficiently, transitioning assets between SVM account space and different levels of state compression. This optimizes performance and reduces costs, especially when managing high transaction volumes.

One of the primary advantages of Metaplex Aura is its ability to improve scalability. Developers can manage millions of assets with far fewer transactions, thanks to Aura's compressed state management.

This reduction in transaction volume not only reduces network traffic, but also lowers costs, making it easier for developers to build applications to handle large-scale user bases without compromising on performance.

With elastic state management, developers can transition assets between SVM account space and various levels of state compression, letting data adapt to the changing needs of their apps.

Aura is a community-driven project that was developed with feedback from over 25 different projects, including NFT marketplaces, infrastructure providers, and game developers.

Launch partners for Aura include some of the top Solana-based platforms and services such as Magic Eden, Tensor, Solflare, QuickNode, and many more.

By open-sourcing the platform (see ⚙️Tools for link to repo), Metaplex invites developers to contribute to its development and help shape and improve the Solana ecosystem.

### 👛 Phantom Embedded Wallets

Phantom has introduced a new [embedded wallet feature](https://phantom.app/learn/crypto-101/embedded-wallets?ref=blog.colosseum.org), making user onboarding easier for developers building on Solana.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QcGq2ikOLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QcGq2ikOLo)

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qtcy89lc1ard1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ab9b37293b53b1c8335613f95220181c3a6b82a)

With seedless sign-in, users can create self-custodial accounts using just an email and a four-digit PIN, removing the need for complicated seed phrases. 

This reduces friction for new users, allowing them to access crypto without app downloads or browser extensions.

The embedded wallet features a full UI within the app, enabling users to swap tokens, view balances, and monitor transactions, all while developers focus on building their core products. 

Additionally, the universal Phantom account ensures seamless access across mobile, embedded, and browser extension versions.

For developers, this simplifies wallet integration, streamlining onboarding and enhancing the user experience. 

Phantom's launch partners include Jupiter Exchange, Raydium, Orca, Drift Protocol, Kamino Finance, and Lulo.

Developers can [apply for early access](https://boo.phantom.app/?ref=blog.colosseum.org).

### 🚅 Bullet L2

Bullet is a new Solana Layer 2 scaling solution being developed on Solana by Zeta Markets, known for its work in creating on-chain derivatives, and Sovereign Labs, a leader in building secure zk-rollups 

It aims to drastically improve the performance of dApps on Solana by using an architecture that combines Solana’s powerful L1 for settlement and data availability with a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that operates off-chain. 

This combination allows Bullet to offer fast transactions and scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security.

The Solana community has long prided itself on being able to scale without the need for an L2. 

Unlike Ethereum, which relies heavily on L2s to handle congestion, Solana has aimed to be a “single giant world computer” capable of processing transactions rapidly on its L1. 

This has made L2 solutions somewhat controversial within the Solana community. 

However, the developers behind Bullet have leveraged Solana’s existing strengths while introducing additional layers to improve performance in specific, high-demand use cases.

For Solana developers, Bullet offers several benefits:

* **Speed and Scalability:** Bullet will allow developers to build dApps that can operate at much higher speeds and larger scales than was previously possible, with a user experience that rivals centralized platforms.
* **Customizability:** By using a modular approach that separates execution and settlement, Bullet gives developers more flexibility in how they design their applications, enabling innovations that are not possible on L1 alone.
* **Seamless Integration:** Since Bullet uses Solana L1 for settlement and data availability, developers can easily integrate their applications with the rest of the Solana ecosystem while benefiting from the enhanced performance of an L2.

Bullet’s testnet is scheduled for Q4 2024, with a full mainnet launch expected in early 2025.

### 👼 Frankendancer... It's aliiiiiiiive!

Jump CSO Kevin Bowers announced during Breakpoint that the Frankendancer client is now live on mainnet, while the much-anticipated Firedancer upgrade has launched on the testnet.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&v=8sl3RcN2Rdk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLilwLeBwGuK7YY8igEkLeFcpdoFRJAa0L&v=8sl3RcN2Rdk)

I presume these are bots, but even in that scenario, how do they manage to submit transactions so fast?

When inspecting via solscan, I see almost all of them spam the network, tho even doing so, getting buy tx landed in the next block should be tough.

Another thing that comes to my mind is perhaps they send directly to leader's TPU, but afaik validators primarily accept transactions from high-staked validators.

>  
>Introducing: Steel  
>  
>Steel is a new modular framework for building smart contracts on Solana. Write programs with minimum boilerplate and maximum flexibility.  
>  
>🧵

&#x200B;

>**Background**  
>  
>While developing ORE, I decided not to use Anchor, the most popular smart contract framework on Solana, and instead wrote our contract in vanilla Rust. I made this decision partly for the learning experience, but also to optimize contract performance.  
>  
>**/2**

&#x200B;

>**Utils**  
>  
>As the codebase evolved, I began refactoring out various helper functions and macros into a utils folder. This folder has since become the bedrock of every new program we are developing at Regolith Labs (pools, boosts, and others).  
>  
>**/3**

&#x200B;

>**Formalization**  
>  
>Through conversations with [@cavemanloverboy](https://x.com/cavemanloverboy) [@Eliascm17](https://x.com/Eliascm17) [@NotDeGhost](https://x.com/NotDeGhost) and others, I came to realize this utils folder could form the foundation of a new modular program framework. So today I'm excited to formally release it as Steel.  
>  
>[https://crates.io/crates/steel](https://crates.io/crates/steel)  
>  
>**/4**

 

>**Modularity**  
>  
>While ""modularity"" is kind of a meme in our industry, we like to call Steel modular because, unlike Anchor, you can use just the bits and pieces that are helpful to you without being forced to adopt everything it has to offer.  
>  
>**/6**

&#x200B;

>**Accounts**  
>  
>For accounts, we use a single enum to manage discriminators and a struct for each account type. The account! macro helps link these types and implement basic serialization logic.  
>  
>**/7**

&#x200B;

>**Instructions**  
>  
>For instructions, we similarly use a single enum to manage discriminators and a struct for each instruction args type. The instruction! macro helps link these types and implement basic serialization logic.  
>  
>**/8**

&#x200B;

>**Entrypoint**  
>  
>Inside the program, Steel offers helper functions for removing entrypoint boilerplate and parsing instructions before dispatching to the implementation logic.  
>  
>**/9**

&#x200B;

>**Loaders**  
>  
>In instructions, Steel offers ""loaders"" for parsing and validating account data. This is currently the area that needs the most work. In a future version, these loaders should return mutable/readonly references to the inner account data.

Reddit,solana,Creating landing pages for meme coins,2024-09-25 14:16:35,"Hey all,

  
So recently, I read about people launching thousands of coins in platforms like [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) and dexscreener moonshot. So, as I was thinking of joining them, I thought it's better maybe for me to offer them my services.

Being a developer with 13 years of experience, I've created a simple landing page which I can replicate over and over again with different meme coins, creating custom landing pages for each of the coins. My problem is, since the market is filled with scammers, how do I prove I'm not one of them.  
  
I've started leaving comments in pump fun forums, expalining my services, but I can understand why people would hesitate to reach out to me because of the market they are in (creating meme coins) and how untrustworthy it is.",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915
Reddit,solana,Solana mainnet coming to WanBridge soon!,2024-09-25 10:02:23,"Wanchain is currently building cross-chain bridges that will connect Solana to several other blockchain networks. Soon, users will be able to transfer their USDC using Wanchain’s XFlows and Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP).

So, what does this mean?

XFlows is Wanchain’s decentralized cross-chain solution, enabling seamless USDC transfers across multiple networks. The CCTP, developed by Circle (the issuer of USDC), plays a key role in this process by allowing USDC to be natively minted on the destination chain. This ensures that cross-chain transactions are:

Native-to-native
Fully decentralized
Free from slippage
Fast
Cost-effective

By combining the power of Wanchain’s XFlows and Circle’s CCTP, users can expect secure, efficient, and seamless cross-chain transactions for their USDC holdings!",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

(I dont want to hold a significant amount of coins on the dev wallet cause I once bought a frozen coin and dont know how bad that actually is ) second question is can any adress pay the ray fee and launch the coin if reaching 100% bonding curve? if yes, does it make sense to hold with no dev wallet? Im not planning any shit just want it to send it to ray, im not interested in actively engaging with the coin as a dev once it reached ray. So does it make sense to make new adress and buy coin and send it to ray with no dev wallet? or is the dev wallet somehow required? If so, would you use the dev wallet wich once got scammed from frozen coin? Is there somehow a backdoor for the wallet that once scammed me to scam me again? thanks for taking ur time. I look forward to get some informations or solutions cause I really want to push this forward but dont want to end up reaching my goal just to realize that some SOL pro farmed my wallet",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

But what would happen if it would be the cases as it’s happening on some implementation that use the Ethereum’s ᴇɪᴘ‐197 precompile ?

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

Reddit,ethereum,Account Abstraction: Crypto Beyond Private Keys,2024-09-18 14:46:04,"Chances are, you have come across the term “account abstraction,” but you don’t know what it means. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

https://preview.redd.it/uliy7j98ykpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab67cd97bb20fc124f47e8b6b274325d3462423

Let’s dive into this fascinating topic and see how it can transform your understanding of cryptocurrency.

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

https://preview.redd.it/d6l81mocxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af084112a700012423b3838f16662eb37501dbcd

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cio8hwgfxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20a3703848b92783e55ea0dfd73e806dba78490

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/iegallxsxkpd1.png?width=2751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb0b8618ebf50cb583ad8fddacc7bedd411d7b3

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Are you staking solo? What’s your take on his proposal?

I've never really understood or been passionate about ETH like I am with bitcoin so, up until now, I've just kept it in case it shoots up in value, whereas with my BTC I never plan to sell.

My question for the ETH community, what would be the reasons for keeping it?

I'm inclined to just buy more BTC with it and forget about ETH altogether but if there's a compelling argument to keep it, then I'm open ears.

Reddit,ethereum,Can KYC Add Security Without Compromising Decentralization? 🤔 ,2024-09-16 19:18:52,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

These were all little bumps in the road to BULLTARD heaven. A simple test from god to see who had the conviction to stay, and the lack of cum in there ball sack to leave.

Fink,diamond,Fidelity,Ark, and the whole gang is buying Bitcoin like your mothers on the block and giving a discount for slop jobs.

For centuries, the Catholic Church controlled the Word of God. Rarely could people read, so they relied on the church for salvation. Even owning a Bible was futile without literacy. The printing press changed this, making the Word of God accessible. This key technology facilitated the Protestant Reformation by spreading new ideas and theological material. One technology shifted centuries of thinking, granting individuals sovereignty, including salvation. Similarly, the internet enabled mass communication, followed by Bitcoin, which introduced absolute scarcity through a decentralized public ledger, disincentivizing violence and theft. On the Bitcoin Standard, prices would decrease over time due to technological advancements. Without money printing, endless wars would cease, and government would truly serve the people, as it did under the gold standard. The printing press separated church and state; Bitcoin separates money and state, as money is just an idea, dangerous to those in power, with narrative control being the ultimate prize.  #Bitcoin",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,bitcoin,If you’re tempted to take out “some profit” check this:,2024-09-30 20:11:50,"Okay I asked chat gpt the following and I know it’s bad at math but I think this looks right:


Say I bought $1000 worth of bitcoin when it was worth $.25 a bitcoin then every time I doubled my money I took out $1000 and kept my original $1000 invested in bitcoin then as bitcoin goes up in Price again and again and again each time I get to 2000 I take out 1000 and I’m left with 1000.How much money would I have now? Given that bitcoin’s current price is $65,000


Let’s break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Purchase**: 
   - You bought $1,000 worth of Bitcoin when the price was $0.25 per Bitcoin.
   - Number of Bitcoins you own initially = $1,000 / $0.25 = **4,000 Bitcoins**.

2. **Doubling Strategy**: 
   - Every time your investment doubles, you take out $1,000 but leave $1,000 invested.
   - For this, we need to track each time the price of Bitcoin doubles, how many Bitcoins you withdraw, and how many you keep invested.

Let’s walk through the price doubling steps, starting at $0.25 and doubling up to $65,000.

### Step-by-Step Doubling:
- **$0.25 to $0.50**: 
  - Value of 4,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (2,000 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$0.50 to $1.00**: 
  - Value of 2,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (1,000 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$1.00 to $2.00**: 
  - Value of 1,000 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (500 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$2.00 to $4.00**: 
  - Value of 500 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (250 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$4.00 to $8.00**: 
  - Value of 250 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$8.00 to $16.00**: 
  - Value of 125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (62.5 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$16.00 to $32.00**: 
  - Value of 62.5 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (31.25 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$32.00 to $64.00**: 
  - Value of 31.25 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (15.625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$64.00 to $128.00**: 
  - Value of 15.625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (7.8125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$128.00 to $256.00**: 
  - Value of 7.8125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (3.90625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$256.00 to $512.00**: 
  - Value of 3.90625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (1.953125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$512.00 to $1,024.00**: 
  - Value of 1.953125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.9765625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$1,024.00 to $2,048.00**: 
  - Value of 0.9765625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.48828125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$2,048.00 to $4,096.00**: 
  - Value of 0.48828125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.244140625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$4,096.00 to $8,192.00**: 
  - Value of 0.244140625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.1220703125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$8,192.00 to $16,384.00**: 
  - Value of 0.1220703125 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.06103515625 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$16,384.00 to $32,768.00**: 
  - Value of 0.06103515625 Bitcoins = $2,000.
  - You take out $1,000 (0.030517578125 Bitcoins remain).
  
- **$32,768.00 to $65,536.00**: 
  - Value of 0.030517578125 Bitcoins = ~$2,000.
  - You take out $1,000, leaving **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins**.

### Final Calculation:
- Now, at a Bitcoin price of **$65,000**, your remaining **0.0152587890625 Bitcoins** are worth:
  - **0.0152587890625 BTC × $65,000 = $991.82**.

So, after taking out $1,000 repeatedly whenever the value doubled, you would now have about **$991.82 worth of Bitcoin** remaining. However, along the way, you would have already withdrawn **$19,000 in total** (since you took out $1,000 each time your investment doubled).

### Total Money:
- Total withdrawals: **$19,000**.
- Remaining Bitcoin value: **$991.82**.
- **Total = $19,991.82**.


So a great outcome but not life changing.

In order to interact with the blockchain with that seed you’ll have to have software to broadcast transactions, and that software requires your private key.

The software can either be in the hardware wallet (ledger, etc.) or software wallet (hot wallet), but at some point a piece of code is going to require your seed phrase.

If that’s the case, you always have to trust the person who created the software for your wallet. If they have any malicious code your seed can be compromised.

What’s the best piece of software for taking an input seed phrase that you created by hand and allow you to interact with the blockchain and DeFi?

But several months later I find that the same message is getting repeated in the same channels, i.e. Saylor, Mallers, Alden, etc. on the typical Bitcoiner channels and it just stays there. It would be great to see the major thought leaders go on other people's platforms and reach a broader audience. Like, it would be great to see Saif or Saylor go on Sam Harris', Maher's, or Rogan's shows. Or, even get two history buffs like Saylor and Dan Carlin together to discuss the issues and how they have played out time and time again amongst past empires and their decline...

1. Is it possible to pay my bond if I do not have a lightning channel?

My parents helped me a lot in my early 30's with money, such as a deposit on a place to buy and i realised a few years ago that I may well struggle to do the same for my kids, which scared me a bit to be honest. 

I reckon they'll be ok. All hail Satoshi! ",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin helped bring our coffee to a worldwide audience. ,2024-09-28 21:48:22,"Hi from El Salvador!

For close to two centuries now El Salvador, and basically every other country who exports coffee has exported green (unroasted) coffee. A couple of hundred years ago it was really the only way to do things since coffee stales and if you put it on a boat and ship it across the world by the time it'd reach the final consumer the quality would suffer too much. Nowadays with modern logistics networks it opens a door to doing things differently. 

In my experience a fair amount of people outside of producing countries do not know how coffee is made, but basically you plant the tree (it's a 5-8 ft tall tree depending on the variety), wait about 3-4 years for that first harvest and then process and dry the coffee. Once it's dried it's shipped across the world. Every year after that you get one harvest a year. Then, traditionally, when it reaches its destination is roasted and sold to the public. 

Like banking, coffee right now is RIDDLED with intermediaries:

A grower sells the coffee cherries to a mill, a mill processes them and sells them to an exporter, an exporter sells them to an importer, an importer sells them to a distributor, a distributor sells them to a roaster, who sells them to a retailer, who sells them to you.

So we figured there's got to be a better way so we went peer to peer. We're in El Salvador, we buy coffee from growers we know and pay them exactly what they ask for their coffee, roast it, and ship it directly to you bypassing tons of intermediaries in worldwide markets and finance all paid for in bitcoin (mostly over lightning). 

We can get you coffee directly from our roastery in San Salvador to your door in 3-5 days depending on where you are in the world. This peer-to-peer model has allowed us to offer top-tier specialty coffee at a better price while cutting out unnecessary layers of the supply chain.

If you're attending the Adopting Bitcoin conference this year in San Salvador, I’ll be speaking about our journey. You can also learn more on our blog at [thegoodbeans.com](http://www.thegoodbeans.com/), or ask me anything here.

Reddit,bitcoin,Oracle-enforced PIN protection vs Secure chip,2024-09-29 14:47:00,"Hi everyone,

I was researching the implementation of the Blockstream Jade's hardware wallet and first I noticed that they don't use the traditional secure element that other popular wallets use. However, what they came up with as a fully open source solution I find it actually pretty clever on top of all the other benefits (not being able to crack the chip directly; making the security layer decentralized; allowing you to run your own Oracle PIN node etc).

I would really love to hear other opinions about this protection design and Jade's wallet in particular. Any users to share their experience and pros/cons?",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,US Congressmen destroy Gary Gensler and call him a liar in 5-hour House Committee hearing,2024-09-30 15:39:27,"Hat tip to Bankless for highlighting the best parts of the 5-hour long House Financial Services Committee hearing with the SEC.

A dozen congressmen intensely grilled the SEC commissioners about all their shady and lawless practices. These are the best parts: https://x.com/BanklessHQ/status/1838602054115512769

Gary Gensler was unable to respond to most of the responses and kept waffling. There were multiple times where congressmen got so pissed off with Gensler that they interrupted him and let SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce respond. Pierce kept agreeing with the congressmen and seemed like she was secretly happy the congressmen finally gave her a voice.

**TL;DW**:

* House representatives got the SEC to admit again that cryptocurrencies are not securities
* Got the SEC to admit that they have been purposefully been ambiguous about regulations, which caused malicious damage to the crypto industry, both to exchanges like Coinbase and to banks that serviced those exchanges like Silvergate which would done fine had the regulations not changed overnight.
* Gensler and Crenshaw were roasted multiple times
* House Majority Whip Emmer basically called Gensler a fat liar and said he lied in court. He was so pissed off at Gensler. Emmer said that the SEC broke the law and lied multiple times.
* Torres used Pokemon and sports cards to show how Gensler regulations would classify sales of collectible cards as securities. Gensler was unable to answer why sales of a Yankee's ticket are not securities and again avoids answering the question, which he immediately got called out for.
* Congressmen said that the SEC's treatment of NFTs as securities instead of as collectibles was ridiculous and a 1st-amendment violation.
* Multiple congressmen talked about Operation Choke Point 2.0 and the SEC's role in it and harming the financial industry

I've also thought it is time for the existing coins to start designing and planning, at a minimum. It's plainly obvious major companies like Apple and Google are already implementing changes, so crypto should be at the forefront of this new era.  
  
This will require major work and there will be impacts and tradeoffs that require consensus.

This is probably why there is such resistance to acknowledging this. I fear we will be left with rushed solutions creating unnecessary disruption, or worse.

Vitalik at least considered an emergency plan. But we should be demanding building/ testing of viable solutions ahead of an emergency.

It will be a full rewrite of how we digitally sign our transactions- not backward compatible- and likely require users to take actions such as transferring to wallets that are signing with the new cryptography.

If you are looking beyond the next 6 months for your portfolio, you'll need to start considering the impacts and which projects are genuinely prepared, not just claims it will be easy to add in.

Quantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype

So, back in June the White House announced that UCLA would host a binational US/India workshop, for national security officials from both countries to learn about the current status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. It fell to my friend and colleague Rafail Ostrovsky to organize the workshop, which ended up being held last week. When Rafi invited me to give the opening talk, I knew he’d keep emailing until I said yes. So, on the 3-hour flight to LAX, I wrote the following talk in a spiral notebook, which I then delivered the next morning with no slides. I called it “Quantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype.” I thought Shtetl-Optimized readers might be interested too, since it contains my reflections on a quarter-century in quantum computing, and prognostications on what I expect soon. Enjoy, and let me know what you think!



Quantum Computing: Between Hope and Hype

by Scott Aaronson

September 16, 2024



When Rafi invited me to open this event, it sounded like he wanted big-picture pontification more than technical results, which is just as well, since I’m getting old for the latter. Also, I’m just now getting back into quantum computing after a two-year leave at OpenAI to think about the theoretical foundations of AI safety. Luckily for me, that was a relaxing experience, since not much happened in AI these past two years. \[Pause for laughs\] So then, did anything happen in quantum computing while I was away?



This, of course, has been an extraordinary time for both quantum computing and AI, and not only because the two fields were mentioned for the first time in an American presidential debate (along with, I think, the problem of immigrants eating pets). But it’s extraordinary for quantum computing and for AI in very different ways. In AI, practice is wildly ahead of theory, and there’s a race for scientific understanding to catch up to where we’ve gotten via the pure scaling of neural nets and the compute and data used to train them. In quantum computing, it’s just the opposite: there’s right now a race for practice to catch up to where theory has been since the mid-1990s.



I started in quantum computing around 1998, which is not quite as long as some people here, but which does cover most of the time since Shor’s algorithm and the rest were discovered. So I can say: this past year or two is the first time I’ve felt like the race to build a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer is actually underway. Like people are no longer merely giving talks about the race or warming up for the race, but running the race.



Within just the last few weeks, we saw the group at Google announce that they’d used the Kitaev surface code, with distance 7, to encode one logical qubit using 100 or so physical qubits, in superconducting architecture. They got a net gain: their logical qubit stays alive for maybe twice as long as the underlying physical qubits do. And crucially, they find that their logical coherence time increases as they pass to larger codes, with higher distance, on more physical qubits. With superconducting, there are still limits to how many physical qubits you can stuff onto a chip, and eventually you’ll need communication of qubits between chips, which has yet to be demonstrated. But if you could scale Google’s current experiment even to 1500 physical qubits, you’d probably be below the threshold where you could use that as a building block for a future scalable fault-tolerant device.



Then, just last week, a collaboration between Microsoft and Quantinuum announced that, in the trapped-ion architecture, they applied pretty substantial circuits to logically-encoded qubits—-again in a way that gets a net gain in fidelity over not doing error-correction, modulo a debate about whether they’re relying too much on postselection. So, they made a GHZ state, which is basically like a Schrödinger cat, out of 12 logically encoded qubits. They also did a “quantum chemistry simulation,” which had only two logical qubits, but which required three logical non-Clifford gates—which is the hard kind of gate when you’re doing error-correction.



Because of these advances, as well as others—what QuEra is doing with neutral atoms, what PsiQuantum and Xanadu are doing with photonics, etc.—I’m now more optimistic than I’ve ever been that, if things continue at the current rate, either there are useful fault-tolerant QCs in the next decade, or else something surprising happens to stop that. Plausibly we’ll get there not just with one hardware architecture, but with multiple ones, much like the Manhattan Project got a uranium bomb and a plutonium bomb around the same time, so the question will become which one is most economic.



If someone asks me why I’m now so optimistic, the core of the argument is 2-qubit gate fidelities. We’ve known for years that, at least on paper, quantum fault-tolerance becomes a net win (that is, you sustainably correct errors faster than you introduce new ones) once you have physical 2-qubit gates that are \~99.99% reliable. The problem has “merely” been how far we were from that. When I entered the field, in the late 1990s, it would’ve been like a Science or Nature paper to do a 2-qubit gate with 50% fidelity. But then at some point the 50% became 90%, became 95%, became 99%, and within the past year, multiple groups have reported 99.9%. So, if you just plot the log of the infidelity as a function of year and stare at it—yeah, you’d feel pretty optimistic about the next decade too!



Or pessimistic, as the case may be! To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, maybe, eventually, someone will need to start thinking about migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack. I think today that message needs to change. I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.



So, I think this moment is a good one for reflection. We’re used to quantum computing having this air of unreality about it. Like sure, we go to conferences, we prove theorems about these complexity classes like BQP and QMA, the experimenters do little toy demos that don’t scale. But if this will ever be practical at all, then for all we know, not for another 200 years. It feels really different to think of this as something plausibly imminent. So what I want to do for the rest of this talk is to step back and ask, what are the main reasons why people regarded this as not entirely real? And what can we say about those reasons in light of where we are today?



Reason #1



For the general public, maybe the overriding reason not to take QC seriously has just been that it sounded too good to be true. Like, great, you’ll have this magic machine that’s gonna exponentially speed up every problem in optimization and machine learning and finance by trying out every possible solution simultaneously, in different parallel universes. Does it also dice peppers?



For this objection, I’d say that our response hasn’t changed at all in 30 years, and it’s simply, “No, that’s not what it will do and not how it will work.” We should acknowledge that laypeople and journalists and unfortunately even some investors and government officials have been misled by the people whose job it was to explain this stuff to them.



I think it’s important to tell people that the only hope of getting a speedup from a QC is to exploit the way that QM works differently from classical probability theory — in particular, that it involves these numbers called amplitudes, which can be positive, negative, or even complex. With every quantum algorithm, what you’re trying to do is choreograph a pattern of interference where for each wrong answer, the contributions to its amplitude cancel each other out, whereas the contributions to the amplitude of the right answer reinforce each other. The trouble is, it’s only for a few practical problems that we know how to do that in a way that vastly outperforms the best known classical algorithms.



What are those problems? Here, for all the theoretical progress that’s been made in these past decades, I’m going to give the same answer in 2024 that I would’ve given in 1998. Namely, there’s the simulation of chemistry, materials, nuclear physics, or anything else where many-body quantum effects matter. This was Feynman’s original application from 1981, but probably still the most important one commercially. It could plausibly help with batteries, drugs, solar cells, high-temperature superconductors, all kinds of other things, maybe even in the next few years.



And then there’s breaking public-key cryptography, which is not commercially important, but is important for other reasons well-known to everyone here.



And then there’s everything else. For problems in optimization, machine learning, finance, and so on, there’s typically a Grover’s speedup, but that of course is “only” a square root and not an exponential, which means that it will take much longer before it’s relevant in practice. And one of the earliest things we learned in quantum computing theory is that there’s no “black-box” way to beat the Grover speedup. By the way, that’s also relevant to breaking cryptography — other than the subset of cryptography that’s based on abelian groups and can be broken by Shor’s algorithm or the like. The centerpiece of my PhD thesis, twenty years ago, was the theorem that you can’t get more than a Grover-type polynomial speedup for the black-box problem of finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions.



So then what remains? Well, there are all sorts heuristic quantum algorithms for classical optimization and machine learning problems — QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), quantum annealing, and so on — and we can hope that sometimes they’ll beat the best classical heuristics for the same problems, but it will be trench warfare, not just magically speeding up everything. There are lots of quantum algorithms somehow inspired by the HHL (Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd) algorithm for solving linear systems, and we can hope that some of those algorithms will get exponential speedups for end-to-end problems that matter, as opposed to problems of transforming one quantum state to another quantum state. We can of course hope that new quantum algorithms will be discovered. And most of all, we can look for entirely new problem domains, where people hadn’t even considered using quantum computers before—new orchards in which to pick low-hanging fruit. Recently, Shih-Han Hung and I, along with others, have proposed using current QCs to generate cryptographically certified random numbers, which could be used in post-state cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. I’m hopeful that people will find other protocol applications of QC like that one — “proof of quantum work.” \[Another major potential protocol application, which Dan Boneh brought up after my talk, is quantum one-shot signatures.\]



Anyway, taken together, I don’t think any of this is too good to be true. I think it’s genuinely good and probably true!



Reason #2



A second reason people didn’t take seriously that QC was actually going to happen was the general thesis of technological stagnation, at least in the physical world. You know, maybe in the 40s and 50s, humans built entirely new types of machines, but nowadays what do we do? We issue press releases. We make promises. We argue on social media.



Nowadays, of course, pessimism about technological progress seems hard to square with the revolution that’s happening in AI, another field that spent decades being ridiculed for unfulfilled promises and that’s now fulfilling the promises. I’d also speculate that, to the extent there is technological stagnation, most of it is simply that it’s become really hard to build new infrastructure—high-speed rail, nuclear power plants, futuristic cities—for legal reasons and NIMBY reasons and environmental review reasons and Baumol’s cost disease reasons. But none of that really applies to QC, just like it hasn’t applied so far to AI.



Reason #3



A third reason people didn’t take this seriously was the sense of “It’s been 20 years already, where’s my quantum computer?” QC is often compared to fusion power, another technology that’s “eternally just over the horizon.” (Except, I’m no expert, but there seems to be dramatic progress these days in fusion power too!)



My response to the people who make that complaint was always, like, how much do you know about the history of technology? It took more than a century for heavier-than-air flight to go from correct statements of the basic principle to reality. Universal programmable classical computers surely seemed more fantastical from the standpoint of 1920 than quantum computers seem today, but then a few decades later they were built. Today, AI provides a particularly dramatic example where ideas were proposed a long time ago—neural nets, backpropagation—those ideas were then written off as failures, but no, we now know that the ideas were perfectly sound; it just took a few decades for the scaling of hardware to catch up to the ideas. That’s why this objection never had much purchase by me, even before the dramatic advances in experimental quantum error-correction of the last year or two.



Reason #4



A fourth reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is that, a century after the discovery of QM, some people still harbor doubts about quantum mechanics itself. Either they explicitly doubt it, like Leonid Levin, Roger Penrose, or Gerard ‘t Hooft. Or they say things like, “complex Hilbert space in 2n dimensions is a nice mathematical formalism, but mathematical formalism is not reality”—the kind of thing you say when you want to doubt, but not take full intellectual responsibility for your doubts.



I think the only thing for us to say in response, as quantum computing researchers—and the thing I consistently have said—is man, we welcome that confrontation! Let’s test quantum mechanics in this new regime. And if, instead of building a QC, we have to settle for “merely” overthrowing quantum mechanics and opening up a new era in physics—well then, I guess we’ll have to find some way to live with that.



Reason #5



My final reason why people didn’t take QC seriously is the only technical one I’ll discuss here. Namely, maybe quantum mechanics is fine but fault-tolerant quantum computing is fundamentally “screened off” or “censored” by decoherence or noise—and maybe the theory of quantum fault-tolerance, which seemed to indicate the opposite, makes unjustified assumptions. This has been the position of Gil Kalai, for example.



The challenge for that position has always been to articulate, what is true about the world instead? Can every realistic quantum system be simulated efficiently by a classical computer? If so, how? What is a model of correlated noise that kills QC without also killing scalable classical computing?—which turns out to be a hard problem.



In any case, I think this position has been dealt a severe blow by the Random Circuit Sampling quantum supremacy experiments of the past five years. Scientifically, the most important thing we’ve learned from these experiments is that the fidelity seems to decay exponentially with the number of qubits, but “only” exponentially — as it would if the errors were independent from one gate to the next, precisely as the theory of quantum fault-tolerance assumes. So for anyone who believes this objection, I’d say that the ball is now firmly in their court.



So, if we accept that QC is on the threshold of becoming real, what are the next steps? There are the obvious ones: push forward with building better hardware and using it to demonstrate logical qubits and fault-tolerant operations on them. Continue developing better error-correction methods. Continue looking for new quantum algorithms and new problems for those algorithms to solve.



But there’s also a less obvious decision right now. Namely, do we put everything into fault-tolerant qubits, or do we continue trying to demonstrate quantum advantage in the NISQ (pre-fault-tolerant) era? There’s a case to be made that fault-tolerance will ultimately be needed for scaling, and anything you do without fault-tolerance is some variety of non-scalable circus trick, so we might as well get over the hump now.



But I’d like to advocate putting at least some thought into how to demonstrate a quantum advantage in the near-term. Thay could be via cryptographic protocols, like those that Kahanamoku-Meyer et al. have proposed. It could be via pseudorandom peaked quantum circuits, a recent proposal by me and Yuxuan Zhang—if we can figure out an efficient way to generate the circuits. Or we could try to demonstrate what William Kretschmer, Harry Buhrman, and I have called “quantum information supremacy,” where, instead of computational advantage, you try to do an experiment that directly shows the vastness of Hilbert space, via exponential advantages for quantum communication complexity, for example. I’m optimistic that that might be doable in the very near future, and have been working with Quantinuum to try to do it.



On the one hand, when I started in quantum computing 25 years ago, I reconciled myself to the prospect that I’m going to study what fundamental physics implies about the limits of computation, and maybe I’ll never live to see any of it experimentally tested, and that’s fine. On the other hand, once you tell me that there is a serious prospect of testing it soon, then I become kind of impatient. Some part of me says, let’s do this! Let’s try to achieve forthwith what I’ve always regarded as the #1 application of quantum computers, more important than codebreaking or even quantum simulation: namely, disproving the people who said that scalable quantum computing was impossible.",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

1. **Kim Kardashian – EthereumMax (EMAX)** 

Kim Kardashian was one of several celebrities, including Floyd Mayweather and Paul Pierce, involved in promoting a cryptocurrency called EthereumMax (EMAX). The project was accused of being a ""pump and dump"" scheme, where the price was artificially inflated before the creators and insiders cashed out.

**Amount Lost**: Investors claimed losses of millions, though the exact figure is debated. Kardashian settled with the SEC in 2022 by paying a $1.26 million fine for failing to disclose that she was paid $250,000 for promoting EMAX on her Instagram account.

# 2. Floyd Mayweather – Centra Tech & EMAX

Floyd Mayweather promoted both the Centra Tech ICO and EthereumMax. Centra Tech was later revealed as a fraudulent ICO, and its founders were arrested for defrauding investors.

**Amount Stolen**: Centra Tech raised $25 million in its fraudulent ICO. Mayweather was fined $600,000 by the SEC for his involvement in the Centra Tech promotion and $400,000 in connection with EthereumMax.

# 3. Jake Paul, Nick Carter, Soulja Boy, Lil Yachty – SafeMoon

All were part of a promotion for SafeMoon, a cryptocurrency that faced allegations of being a pump-and-dump scheme. The founders and influencers allegedly hyped the coin, sold their tokens at high prices, and left investors with worthless tokens.

The total losses associated with SafeMoon are difficult to quantify, but the market cap reportedly dropped by billions at one point. Several lawsuits followed, accusing influencers of profiting while regular investors were left with steep losses.

# 4. FaZe Clan Members – Save the Kids Token

 Several members of the gaming group FaZe Clan, including FaZe Kay, FaZe Jarvis, FaZe Nikan, and FaZe Teeqo, were involved in promoting a token called ""Save the Kids,"" which was purportedly created to donate to charity. However, it turned out to be a pump-and-dump scam, and the coin lost nearly all of its value shortly after launch.

It's estimated that the scam resulted in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, in losses. The exact amount is unclear due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency wallets, but the project collapsed soon after launch.

**5. Logan Paul – Dink Doink, CryptoZoo**

Logan Paul promoted the cryptocurrency Dink Doink, which was created as a meme coin. It was marketed heavily on social media but quickly lost almost all of its value, with investors accusing Paul of misleading them for personal gain.  
Paul was also involved in the CryptoZoo project, which was promoted as a blockchain game with NFT eggs that would hatch into animals. However, the game never materialized as promised, leading to accusations of fraud and a backlash from investors. Paul later apologized and offered a refund to some of the investors.  


The total loss for investors was substantial, especially in CryptoZoo, where millions were lost, though the exact figures for both projects are unclear.

6. **Tana Mongeau – Titscoin**

Tana Mongeau promoted a coin called ""Titscoin,"" which was part of the larger wave of meme coins. While the project did not lead to major legal action, it quickly faded from existence, and many investors lost money after its value crashed.  
Amount Lost: There’s no clear figure on how much investors lost, but the project was relatively short-lived and associated with significant value decline.

7. **Adin Ross – MILF Token**

Adin Ross, a popular Twitch streamer, was involved in promoting the MILF Token in a livestream, encouraging his followers to invest in the cryptocurrency. However, after the promotion, the token's value plummeted, and Ross later admitted on stream that he had no idea what MILF Token was and that he had been paid to promote it without much investigation. The quick price crash led many to believe the project was a pump-and-dump scheme.  
Amount Lost: While the exact amount lost is unclear, investors were left with worthless tokens shortly after the promotion.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Introducing: The DogeList (Beta) - List for free and find others near you for in-person peer-to-peer crypto transactions anywhere in the world,2024-09-29 15:24:38,"Hi fellow Crypto Enthusiasts,

We are proud to announce the launch of [The DogeList](https://thedogelist.com/). This site is designed to allow buyers and sellers to post a meeting location anywhere on the map where a person would like to transact using Dogecoin as the currency. This could be a public meetup location like a local bank, or coffee shop, or anywhere you would meet to sell a good or service.

Why Dogecoin? With a high speed, low transaction cost, transferring payment doesn't have to break the bank. Plus, Doge is very fun - much wow!

Key features:

* This site does NOT interact with your wallet or escrow transactions in any way. It is simply a way for people to find locally ""for sale"" and ""wanted"" listings, services, and brick-and-mortar locations that accept Dogecoin for payment.
* You enter the item you want to buy or sell or the service you offer and include one (or more) picture(s). You put the amount of currency you would like to receive for the item i.e. $50 USD. The site then posts the item for $50 USD and the equal amount of Dogecoin which adjusts based on the market.
* Map based searches. Instead of looking through just a list of items, you get a map-based view as well to see exactly where everything is for sale. Pin drops on the map can be anywhere in your town - choose a local coffee shop or bank as your pin drop to meet up for safety and privacy!
* You can choose to be a personal seller where you can sell goods (like used video games, cars, clothes etc) or services (like cell phone repair, dog walking, etc) and meet up at locations of your choice or you can choose to be a business account for brick-and-mortar storefronts. Business accounts have DMs turned off but includes store hours and you can direct people to your store that accepts Dogecoin as payment.

Again, we don't handle any payments or transactions. Buyers and sellers use wallets of their choice in person and don't enter any information like that into the site.

We appreciate any and all feedback! Please feel free to put any feedback here or through our profile links.

Thanks! The DogeList Team",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,NSA cryptanalysis in the 90's,2024-09-30 13:46:51,"I was reading an old NSA internal publication about their reliance on HPC for cryptanalytic efforts: [https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/29/2002751648/-1/-1/0/NSA_AND_THE_SUPERCOMPUTER.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/29/2002751648/-1/-1/0/NSA_AND_THE_SUPERCOMPUTER.PDF).

  My guess is it's from around 1995, as it mentions Cray Computers going bankrupt and Convex purchase by HP.

  On page 5 it mentions that embarrassingly parallel problems *form only a small fraction of the problem set at NSA.*


  They prefer vector computers with a single large memory over (new at the time) MPP machines with thousands of processors and distributed memory.  
  


  It made me wonder what they were working on. Isn't most cryptanalysis embarrassingly parallel? Or maybe they focused on problems that don't scale well without a fast interconnect e.g. linear algebra?",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,crypto,Concern for Speed and Scalability of NIST PQC?,2024-09-25 21:23:42,"While I am glad that the NIST announced support for Post-Quantum Algorithms I am concerned about their performance.

Speed and scalability matters in the business world because all organizations are constrained by a budget.

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past. And asking them to train their infosec and opsec teams to learn how to deal with these algorithms that slow down performance will be a difficult task.",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,crypto,device-to-device encryption protocol,2024-09-23 11:06:09,"Hello,  
I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI  
[https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ\_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg](https://mega.nz/file/d5VyFB6L#lSnTkJ_IxlmLaxVsWeySML0X3mF5uqKlFlh9NAgQJvg)

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

Reddit,crypto,Secure and Private Encrypted P2P Chat in Javascript,2024-09-22 09:03:15,"im working on a decentralized p2p chat app where it handles all the important cryptographic functions in browser-based javascript. 

the crypto functionality can be seen [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/.github/blob/main/cryptography/Cryptography.js) (it is used as a micro frontend and loaded into the main app at runtime). the main chat app is open source for transparency [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat).

i think the approach on security in this app is unique and i would like to know which vulnerabilities i haven't considered. i try to answer all concerns in [this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityAdvice/comments/1ev5kqn/is_this_a_secure_messaging_app/).

i think if i stick to the principle of avoiding using any kind of ""required"" service provider (myself included) and allowing the frontend and the peerjs-server to be hosted independently, im on track for creating a chat system with the ""fewest moving parts"". im hope you will agree this is true p2p and i hope i can use this as a step towards unparalleled privacy and security.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-10-01 00:56:41.127915

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

        return record;

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?
