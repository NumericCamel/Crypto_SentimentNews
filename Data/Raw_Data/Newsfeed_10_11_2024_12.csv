Over 100% increase in value drove the token’s market capitalization above $5 billion. But as is always the case with cryptocurrencies, what rises must fall at least momentarily. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Cardano Surges In Strength—Now 10x More Powerful, Analyst Says The coin’s surge is exhibiting indications of stalling after weeks of increasing momentum. Traders are now closely observing what can happen next for this once-red-hot asset. According to crypto price prediction site CoinCheckup, SUI is selling 220% below its expected price for next month, suggesting a possible undervaluation. Price Slips And Declining Market Activity SUI was trading at $1.84 at press time after losing 5% of its value within only 24 hours. Based on CoinMarketCap, trading volumes have likewise dropped by 4%. This decline in activity suggests, at least for the time being, a decreasing interest in the token. The technical signs hardly seem much better. Tracking money flow into and out of an asset, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has also been on a downward slope in the last seven days. This is an indication that money is fleeing SUI, usually leading to issues for price stability. Moreover, the CMF has entered negative territory, suggesting that purchasing interest is currently subordinated to selling pressure. SUI: Slowing Momentum But Potential Bounce The token started to sell off as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped below a key signal line, indicating declining momentum. Still, there is a positive aspect here. Should the RSI show a positive turn once more, it may indicate a buying chance for those who think SUI has long-term promise. If selling keeps on, analysts say SUI might test support at $1.70; this might not be a negative outcome. Strong support levels draw buyers who see value at lower levels, thereby acting as a basis for the price to increase once again. SUI will have to barrel its way past the resistance at $2, a fundamental psychological and technical barrier, if it is to break out from its present downturn. Cooling Interest Meanwhile, SUI, which has lately been seeing explosive growth, also seem to be cooling off. From an all-time high of $560 million to $450 million, open interest declined 10% over the past 24 hours. This implies that traders are closing positions as excitement declines, thus helping to explain the general sell pressure on the coin. Some traders would see the drop in open interest as a sign of opportunity even with this cooling off. Prices falling always mean that buyers will re-enter the market, particularly if they feel SUI is underpriced.

The meme coin has caught the attention of analysts and traders, with mixed opinions about its next move. Some believe Dogecoin is preparing for a rally, while others suggest further declines could be ahead. Key data from IntoTheBlock highlights the importance of short-term traders in driving liquidity for meme coins like DOGE. This cohort of traders remains a significant source of activity, often influencing rapid price fluctuations. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat Dogecoin is holding strong above the critical $0.10 level, a key psychological support for the asset. If the price maintains momentum, the next bullish target is around $0.11, which could spark more excitement and buying interest in the market. As speculation continues, all eyes are on whether Dogecoin can sustain its recent strength or if it will face another wave of selling pressure. The coming days determine the meme coin’s direction in the weeks ahead. Dogecoin Price Driven By Speculation  Dogecoin faces intense speculation as investors and analysts express differing views about its future price action. After several weeks of ups and downs, the meme coin has been subjected to massive volatility, reflecting the overall market’s erratic behavior. The uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin has led to heated debates about whether it will rally or continue to fall. Key data from IntoTheBlock reveals the pivotal role of short-term traders in driving meme coins, particularly Dogecoin. These tokens thrive on hype and speculative trading activity, and DOGE leads the pack with the highest number of active short-term traders. Over the past week, Dogecoin has seen approximately 113,000 short-term traders, underscoring its dominant position in the meme coin space. Interestingly, DEGEN, a much smaller token, has also attracted around 23,000 short-term traders—similar to Shiba Inu’s, despite DEGEN’s market cap being only 10% of Shiba Inu’s size. This highlights the speculative frenzy within the meme coin ecosystem, where even lesser-known assets garner significant trading activity. Most mid-sized meme coins, in comparison, show only around 4,000 active short-term traders, illustrating Dogecoin’s continued strength. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details Despite the speculative nature of these assets, Dogecoin’s ability to attract the most active traders signifies resilience and hints at a potential for future rallies, even amid broader market uncertainty. DOGE Holding Above $0.10 Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.108, testing the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) as resistance. Bulls aiming to maintain momentum must reclaim this key indicator to increase prices. The 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) also sits at $0.1088, just under 1% above the current price. This creates a crucial resistance zone for DOGE. A clear break above the 200 MA and 200 EMA and the psychological $0.11 mark would likely trigger a rally, pushing the price higher as bullish momentum takes hold. However, failure to reclaim these indicators could lead to a more significant correction. In this case, DOGE could face a drop to $0.088, a key lower demand level, signaling further downside in the coming days.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Top Analyst Predicts What’s Next For Crypto,2024-10-11 08:00:35+00:00,"Crypto analyst Bob Loukas has released a new video analysis titled “No Bull.” In the video, Loukas delves into the current state of the Bitcoin market, addressing growing concerns about the possibility of a canceled bull run. Loukas begins by acknowledging the prolonged period of consolidation for the Bitcoin price. He senses that “there is now some fear creeping into the market,” partly due to factors such as the Bitcoin ETF being “out for quite some time” and the halving having “come and go,” without leading to significant upward price movement. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Loukas observes that while traditional markets are performing robustly—with “the stock market making all-time highs seemingly every week” and “even gold making big all-time highs”—Bitcoin continues to “languish,” and altcoins are “pretty much dying a slow death.” He notes that “the only thing out there that’s really working is the really speculative memecoins,” contributing to negative sentiment in the crypto space. However, he considers this development to be “kind of normal,” emphasizing that despite these challenges, Bitcoin remains “close to the all-time highs from the prior cycle.” Discussing the eight months of consolidation in Bitcoin’s price, Loukas interprets this period as a bullish sign. “Eight months of consolidation is actually pretty bullish if the timing is right in the four-year cycle. Sentiment is right, it’s been reset; fundamentals, macro, I think they all look right,” he states. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Path To $80,000 “Melt-Up” In Q4 2024 – Details Inside Loukas further highlights that the market is “23 months in” since the lows of the last cycle in November 2022, “just shy of a 24-month or 2-year anniversary of this cycle,” which is due to conclude around November-December 2026. He acknowledges the “quite a bit of fear that’s sort of crept into this market” following a “very bullish, very frothy period” from the ETF approval leak in September-October 2023 up to the peak in March 2024. One of the main fears, according to Loukas, is that Bitcoin made its last all-time high seven months ago in March, and since then, “we’ve been forming these lower highs on the monthly and also to some extent a lower low structure.” This has created anxiety among investors who “entered the market way too late, waiting for confirmation,” only to find themselves “locked out when the market went on this five straight months move,” without providing an opportunity to buy during a dip. He points out that many investors have “rolled into a bunch of altcoins in this later period that are now down 50, 60, 70%,” leading to a situation where, despite Bitcoin being “still up around 3x off the lows,” a lot of people feel they haven’t “extracted any sort of value out of this cycle” or have even “lost money over this period.” Loukas considers this scenario to be “quite normal from a cycle structure perspective.” He emphasizes that during this bullish phase, the market didn’t experience a “typical 30% decline at any given point,” with the “biggest declines” being “mostly time-based and were only around about 20% from peak to trough before making a new high.” This atypical behavior “threw a lot of people off” and “made it difficult for people to get in,” as they were “looking to buy on a dip which never really eventuated.” Loukas suggests that the current consolidation is a necessary phase to “completely reset sentiment in order to prepare for the next phase of this four-year cycle.” He finds it significant that Bitcoin is “sitting here 23 months, just around 20% or so off the all-time highs of the last four-year cycle high back in 2021,” which makes it feel “more primed for the next phase of the four-year cycle than anything else.” He also draws parallels with previous cycles, noting that from the cycle low in December 2018 to the first point where Bitcoin made a new high, “it took 23 months to get to the price four-year cycle high to exceed that.” Similar patterns were observed in earlier cycles, with timeframes of “around 25 months” and “around 22 months” to reach new all-time highs. In contrast, the current cycle achieved this milestone “in just 16 months, much sooner,” which he attributes largely to the ETF news that “forced buyers in earlier in the cycle than normal.” Loukas believes that this accelerated timeline has created a dynamic where “we now have to rotate a lot of coins,” allowing “a lot of whales, a lot of old-timers” to “unlock” and “exit and rotate,” while “institutional players, larger account players have been accumulating those coins in this period.” He views this as “a matter of time more than anything else,” interpreting the current period as a process where the market “ends up erasing all that bullish sentiment” from the previous phase, thus allowing “a complete separation from one phase of the cycle to this phase of the cycle”—essentially a “mid-cycle decline.” When Will BTC Price Break Out? Overall, Loukas remains largely optimistic: “So far in this four-year cycle, I see nothing that has changed that trajectory, nothing in the profile or the structure that tells me that this cycle is any different to the last cycles.” He cites several factors supporting his bullish outlook, including “massive inflows into Bitcoin, mostly institutional players,” and the absorption of large sell-offs by entities like “the German government” and “the US government,” which have not significantly impacted the price. Loukas emphasizes that “price is down only 20%; it’s held up well.” He also mentions that “the ETF is still there; it’s going to be pushed through the independent advisor channels,” and “the timing is there; the macro, the fundamentals are there.” Loukas is particularly excited about the cyclical patterns, noting that “the third year of each of these four cycles is where the magic happens.” He explains that “the first year surprises everybody, that makes up a lot of ground. The second year seems like it stalls because it consolidates that first year of gains. And the third year is the mania year. And right now, beginning next month, we have the mania year that is on deck.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hope: Mt. Gox Delays Repayment Plan Until October 2025 He predicts that “within the next 90 days… we’re going to break out of this consolidating range; we’re going to break to the upside.” Once this happens, he believes Bitcoin “isn’t going to look back,” anticipating a period that “may only see one or two red monthly candles and mostly green candles.” While he refrains from providing specific price targets, he acknowledges that reaching “somewhere between $120,000 and $180,000 also seems very reasonable.” Loukas emphasizes that the focus should be on “time and sentiment,” aiming for a move “in the range where prior cycles have peaked,” which has been “very consistent at around month 35 since the last low.” This timing would place the projected peak around “October of 2025,” giving “another 12 months to an expected or projected peak.” He notes that this is not set in stone and that the peak could come “three, four, five months earlier,” as market movements “can come in many different flavors.” Turning to the immediate future, Loukas admits that the next two months are “a little murky,” with “a lot of factors still at play right now.” He brings up the upcoming US election on November 4th, mentioning that “Trump and the GOP have really been pushing crypto and Bitcoin,” and that “the market is certainly going to respond very, very favorably to an election win by the GOP purely because of their stance on crypto.” However, he clarifies that he doesn’t think “it matters one bit” who wins, as Bitcoin has thrived even when “governments have been very hostile towards it.” Loukas speculates that the market might “trend sideways into that period in November,” and that a significant move might not occur until after the election concludes. He suggests that “we still have around three to four weeks of some trending sideways action,” and he would be “highly surprised if this market can push into the $70,000s before the election here in the US.” At press time, BTC traded at $60,699.

Gox Delays Repayment Plan Until October 2025,2024-10-11 06:30:26+00:00,"In a development that could offer relief for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto ecosystem, Mt. Gox, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange that was hacked in 2014, has announced a significant delay in its repayment plan for affected creditors. Originally set for October 31, 2024, the new deadline for repayments has been pushed to October 31, 2025. Mt. Gox Trustee Announces New Repayment Timeline This delay is particularly notable given that the repayment of approximately 200,000 BTC to creditors could have exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Had the repayments proceeded as scheduled, there was concern that many affected investors might liquidate their holdings en masse, potentially exacerbating Bitcoin’s existing downtrend and leading to a sharp price decline. Related Reading: SEC Strikes Again: Cumberland DRW Charged For ‘Unregistered Crypto Operations’ In a statement released on Thursday, the Rehabilitation Trustee outlined the current status of the repayment efforts. It noted that while significant progress has been made in processing repayments, many creditors have yet to receive their funds due to incomplete procedures or issues encountered during the repayment process. The Trustee stated: With the exception of certain types of repayments, the Rehabilitation Trustee has largely completed the Base Repayment, Early Lump-Sum Repayment, and Intermediate Repayment for rehabilitation creditors who have completed the necessary procedures. However, the statement highlighted that a considerable number of rehabilitation creditors still await their repayments. In light of these challenges, and with permission from the court, the Trustee determined it was in the best interest of all parties to extend the deadline for repayments. Key Levels To Watch For Bitcoin Amid Ongoing Fluctuations Despite recent optimism surrounding the Bitcoin market, the cryptocurrency has once again fallen below the critical $60,000 mark. This decline follows a brief uptrend triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut interest rates on September 18, which initially boosted confidence among crypto investors. Bitcoin had rallied to approximately $66,500 on September 27, marking its best September performance in over a decade. However, the cryptocurrency has since faced a sell-off, resulting in losses exceeding 2% in the last 24 hours and nearly 9% over the past two weeks. Related Reading: XRP Could Surge To $60 Overnight Using SWIFT Model, Expert Says Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has pointed out that Bitcoin is currently down around 6% for October. Historically, the cryptocurrency has experienced downturns in October only twice: in 2014, when it fell by 12.95%, and in 2018, with a decline of 3.83%.  Both years were characterized by bear market conditions. With the current year being a Halving year—an event that historically has led to price increases—there is a prevailing sentiment that Bitcoin may avoid a negative monthly close this October, according to Rekt’s analysis. Rekt Capital also noted that Bitcoin is currently testing the Weekly Re-Accumulation Range Low, which is around $60,600. This level serves as crucial support, and maintaining a weekly close above it could set the stage for a potential upward movement. Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to hold this support, the analyst warns that it could lead to further declines, potentially pushing the price below $55,000. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $59,650, as seen in the daily BTC/USDT chart below.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

ETH is now correcting losses and might aim for a fresh increase above the $2,420 resistance. Ethereum remained in a bearish zone and traded below the $2,360 zone. The price is trading below $2,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must stay above the $2,350 support level to start decent increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Upside Break Ethereum price failed to start a fresh increase above the $2,450 resistance zone. ETH remained in a bearish zone like Bitcoin and traded below the $2,365 support zone. There was also a move below the $2,350 level. The price tested the $2,320 support zone. A low was formed at $2,329 and the price is now rising. There was a move above the $2,350 and $2,365 levels.

The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,468 swing high to the $2,329 low. A clear move above the $2,420 resistance might send the price toward the $2,450 resistance. An upside break above the $2,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions.

As ADA’s price falls 2.9%, some analysts warn of the next key level to watch out for. Related Reading: Worldcoin Drops 6% Amid Alameda Research 1.5 Million Token Sale, Will WLD Price Hold? Charles Hoskinson Defends Cardano On Thursday, Charles Hoskinson addressed the adverse response towards Cardano in an X post. Hoskinson noted that the crypto community’s sentiment about the project has lately been more negative than usual. However, he argued that Twitter’s sentiment change isn’t a reflection of the project failing “but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” Cardano’s “Voltaire” era is set to turn the network into “the most advanced blockchain governance system,” focusing on decentralized governance and its future sustainability. Hoskinson believes that Cardano’s collaborative efforts and the transparency of the network is what sets it apart from the rest of the crypto space. “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others. Their backroom deals and dirty tricks can’t be hidden because there is no one to ask to do it under the table,” he added. In the post, the project’s founder also underscored Cardano’s “passion” for integrity and long-term vision for growth and progress: Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here. That’s the difference that makes a difference. Lastly, Hoskinson remarked that the project is not dying but “thriving and growing.” He that ADA is one of the last cryptocurrencies still wanting to be a real crypto instead of “the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences.” ADA Could See A 10% Drop Soon The crypto community reacted to Hoskinson’s message, with many arguing that, regardless of the developments, the Network’s “lack of volume” and “limited” ecosystem growth remains a problem for its community. Meanwhile, part of ADA’s community agreed with Hoskinson, concurring that “it is the only chain that has truly built what I can only see as the groundwork to deliver on the promise of crypto.” Despite the ongoing criticism, some market watchers remain bullish about ADA’s future price action. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that the cryptocurrency will “easily” reclaim the $1 mark before year’s end. To Gambardello, the exponential surge “could happen fast” and leave many “flabbergasted.” Additionally, he stated that after the 200% surge, ADA’s potential targets of $5 and $10 would “look more realistic.” Related Reading: Experts Discuss What Made Solana Memecoins The Cycle’s Top Narrative Conversely, crypto analyst Sebastian warned about a key level to watch for following ADA’s recent performance. Earlier this week, the analyst highlighted that ADA showed signs of a breakout after retesting the trendline it had recently broken above $0.35. However, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped 2.9% in the last 24 hours, falling below the $0.34 mark. The analyst signaled that ADA must hold the current levels as failing to bounce from the $0.335 level could send the token to a retest of the $0.30 support level. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.337, a 1.95% and 2% decline in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin On The Brink: Will $60K Hold Or Is A Major Correction Coming?,2024-10-11 02:00:44+00:00,"After briefly rising above $63,000 in recent days, renewing investor’s hope on “uptober,” Bitcoin has once again dampened this excitement by decreasing to as low as the $60,000 region today. This unappealing performance has led to a CryptoQuant analyst, Aytekin, raising and sharing insight on an important question: “Is it reasonable to expect a final shakeout before the next big move?” Related Reading: Is The Worst Over For Bitcoin? Analyst Suggests Local Bottom May Be Here Bitcoin Next Move: Major Correction Looming? In a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is currently in a high open interest zone, having exceeded the critical $18 billion level. Historically, when open interest levels reached this point, major corrections followed. The analyst mentioned that the current market sentiment appears divided, noting: The market seems indecisive in many aspects, with some believing that the next big upside move is on the horizon, while others think BTC’s downward trend remains strong. A common belief is that BTC may need a final shakeout before surging to a new all-time high (ATH). Aytekin added that funding rates, though slightly above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), suggest that long traders are still dominant. However, significant price corrections in the past often occurred when funding rates turned negative, which hasn’t happened yet. Aytekin concluded that, while a final shakeout might occur, the depth of the correction may not be as severe given the relatively moderate funding rates. BTC Price Outlook As Bitcoin has struggled to break through key resistance levels, its recent price action reflects ongoing market indecision. Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin maintained stability above the $60,000 mark, but failed to make a major move to reclaim $70,000. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has slipped by 2.9%, currently trading at $60,485. This decline follows the asset’s brief surge to $63,774 earlier in the week, which sparked optimism for a possible move toward the $65,000 and then $70,000 mark. Prominent crypto analyst Ali recently commented on Bitcoin’s price action, noting that Bitcoin is still trading within a “descending parallel channel.” According to Ali, the asset was rejected at the upper boundary of this channel, signalling the potential for further downside. “We might see a drop to the middle boundary at $58,000 or even the lower boundary at $52,000,” Ali noted in a post on X. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Path To $80,000 “Melt-Up” In Q4 2024 – Details Inside He emphasized that a bullish breakout is unlikely unless Bitcoin clears the $66,000 level, a price point that has acted as a significant resistance point in recent weeks. #Bitcoin remains stuck in a descending parallel channel. After the recent rejection at the upper boundary, we might see a drop to the middle boundary at $58,000 or even the lower boundary at $52,000.

You can see their Cubik page here: [https://www.cubik.so/p/open-cardinal](https://www.cubik.so/p/open-cardinal) 

  
Or you can go directly to their website in [https://opencardinal.com](https://opencardinal.com)

Anyways, thought it was worth sharing what some chads open-sourced for the rest of us looking for a staking contract that's reliable and trustworthy.

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-10-11 02:25:45,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Long story short, the launch didn’t go well and the project didn’t take off at all. I am a noob in the field and I just ended up selling all my coins and called it a day after an hour. In between time, some random guy with a big account on twitter (<100k followers) reached to me via the twitter account I had made for the project. He asked me if I wanted to relaunch it with his support. He says he likes the meme and thinks it could do well (I tend to agree). He says he has a specific strat in place regarding the launch itself and that he can help promote and market the project for free and that he is ready to work for his bag. I am supposed to have a call with the guy tomorrow but what do you guys think of this? I find this approach a bit sus myself and would appreciate your opinion on this.

That's all folks! The Solana 📡 Radar Hackathon has come to an end.

The Colosseum team is organizing all the submissions and preparing to start the judging process, which should take 3-4 weeks.

The total number of submissions and a public directory will be published soon.

Here's the rest of the news...

### 📜 State of Solana: Breakpoint Edition

At Breakpoint 2024 the Solana Foundation released its first-ever **State of the Solana Ecosystem** report outlining major milestones and exciting developments.

Some of the highlights include:

**Institutional Adoption and Tokenization:** Solana is seeing accelerated adoption by institutional players, with new tokenization projects from Franklin Templeton, Securitize (partnering with BlackRock’s BUIDL), and Societe Generale. 

**Mobile App Development:** 2024 is a breakthrough year for mobile app development on Solana.

Major new mobile apps include:

* Jupiter: A leading DeFi aggregator expanding to mobile.
* DRiP: A social app built on Solana.
* PhotoFinish LIVE: A mobile-based horse racing game.

Solana’s mobile focus is also growing with the release of [Solana Mobile’s Seeker](https://blog.colosseum.org/solana-seeker-encode-bootcamp-worldid/) phone and Jambo’s JamboPhone. These devices and apps are creating opportunities for developers to build mobile-first experiences.

**Cross-Border Payments and Stablecoins:** The Solana payments ecosystem continues to expand, with launches such as Sling for cross-border payments, PayFi, and debit cards powered by Solana-based stablecoins.

**Decentralized Energy Sector (DePIN):** The DePIN sector is still growing on Solana, focusing on solutions for the energy crisis. 

Notable projects like Project Zero (a decentralized renewable energy network) and Powerledger migrating to Solana, highlight the intersection of blockchain and renewable energy. 

**Funding and Hackathons:** Solana projects raised $173 million in Q3 2024, the highest since Q2 2022, signaling a strong commitment to early-stage development. 

Additionally, participation in developer events like Colosseum’s hackathons has surged, with a 36% increase in registrations for the Radar hackathon compared to Arena. 

With increasing funding, hackathon participation, and new opportunities, Solana continues to give developers a dynamic ecosystem to build the future of Web3.

### 🖇️ Blinks Action Chaining

Dialect has rolled out new Blinks capabilities, including Action Chaining, Advanced Input Types, and Multichain Compatibility across major wallets like Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, OKX, ByBit, and more.

Action Chaining is the star feature of this update, letting developers create multi-step processes within a single Blink.

For example, you can now guide users through filling in shipping details, making a purchase, and entering a follow-up email, all in one streamlined flow.

Developers just need to add a next attribute in the links section of the *ActionPostResponse*. This small change unlocks the power to build complex user experiences across any app or service, such as voting on governance, making purchases, or engaging in DeFi actions anywhere the link is shared.

For more technical details and a step-by-step guide, check out [Dialect's documentation](https://docs.dialect.to/documentation/actions/actions/action-chaining?ref=blog.colosseum.org).

[**Action Chaining (& More) Now Available Everywhere**](https://medium.com/dialect-labs/action-chaining-more-now-available-everywhere-ae761e9b995f?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

### 🌐 Spherenet

Sphere has unveiled Spherenet, a permissioned, privacy-focused distributed ledger built using a modified SVM.

It's designed to provide a bridge between traditional finance systems and blockchains for financial institutions that must comply with regulatory frameworks.

By integrating compliance features directly into its architecture, Spherenet allows developers to create DeFi solutions that meet stringent global financial regulations, including KYC and AML requirements.

Another advantage for developers is the ability to build privacy-preserving apps, thanks to Spherenet’s integration of ZK proofs and other cryptographic technologies.

Spherenet also provides integration of fiat funding through stablecoin bridging mechanisms, allowing developers to create solutions that facilitate cross-border payments and settlements, and fiat on/off ramps that work with traditional systems in a compliant way.

For DeFi developers looking to build applications that bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, Spherenet provides the regulatory compliance, privacy, and stability required to attract institutional users.

Reddit,solana,Phantom Wallet  - Alert to Users -,2024-10-10 23:09:49,"This is for the Phantom Wallet users.  My Phantom wallet was hacked and I believe I discovered a big hole in that wallet's security.

\*\* I'm alerting users that have a Phantom Wallet to change the password immediately to something unique (a new password never used before). Apparently, PW is more important than your ""seed words"".

I contacted Phantom about the hack, and their technical team responded with a ton of typical questions about where I shared my seed words, who I shared them with... They also try to insinuate in these questions that my computer was hacked and the seed words were stolen that way. My seed words were on a piece of paper in my safe.

What got me was that one question they ask: ""Where do you store the seed words where someone could access them?""  

My answer was the Phantom Wallet.  The wallet itself. 

Please correct me if I'm off on the science. If you know about Sol blockchain code, put it on the chopping block.   But I think I was able to piece together how this hack was done.

I narrowed it down to two things ---> 1. An Inside Job or 2. A Password Hole.

The Hack:  My wallet fell prey to that scam we've seen on reddit b4, where the wallet gets hacked and they drain any sol that's in the account or sent to it. All sol deposits immediately get resent to the hacker's wallet address.  Since the sol balance always stays empty, any tokens on that wallet are stuck forever (or until the hacker gets around to it).  Luckily I only lost about $40 on this wallet.

The Password Hole: Since my seed words are in cold storage, the only way to access the wallet was using the password login. What I discovered is you can access your seed words and your private key in the wallet's settings.  You just need to re-enter the password.

The Method: I have hypothesized that hackers are buying PW lists off the black market (these are those stolen password breaches we hear in the news frequently). They initiate a crawl algo that runs every stolen password against every SOL address in the blockchain.  All they need is your stolen pw and the wallet address. If a hacker crawls millions of addresses, it could add up quite a bit. That then allows them to add the automated botcode/extensions/scripts to the wallet.

Stealing my password was the only way this could have happened. It could have happened through a Dapp, which is a possibility. 

To protect myself from this, I do things a little different. I now disconnect when not in use. Once I do my business, I immediately disconnect and ""unallow"" the Dapp access in the phantom settings.

Is it normal to have access to your seed words from the digital wallet's settings? I dunno, Davey.

I told Phantom this. I asked them to look into removing the seed words from settings in the wallet.  I also told them I now anticipate a 50/50 chance of my Phantom wallet getting hacked. They haven't responded since.  I think they might've got offended by my possible ""inside job"" theory.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,solana,My crypto were stolen from my phantom wallet. Please help,2024-10-08 19:33:21,"Good afternoon community

A couple of hours ago today I had 36000 Hammy tokens stolen from a phantom wallet. I never interacted with any malicious site or signed contracts from strangers. I also never opened any scam nft. So I can't understand how I was robbed and I am afraid that I will be emptied of more accounts from the same seed phrase. Although I already moved most of my funds to binance. I think it might have been through TG since 3 hours ago I decided to invest in the NOW token. Going to the Pumpfun website. I saw among the comments that someone posted the TG link of a supposed CTO of the coin, so I opened it to take a look.

[That is the comment](https://preview.redd.it/hmtmhpa81ltd1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=08a76a8615a422e5cbfc388505b275997a6567fc)

When I opened it, it asked me to do a verification like most TG groups, with the difference that in this one it asked me to scan a QR code, I was stupid and scanned it and I didn't get into any group, so I forgot about it. Half an hour later I started to check my wallets and saw that I was missing 36000 Hammy tokens and I feared the worst...so I checked my transaction history and realized that indeed they had been stolen.I couldn't explain it because as I explained before I always avoid misusing my wallet. So I guess it had to be because of the qr code I scanned from TG. When I checked the sessions I realized from telegram that I had an open session on a device in Paris, France (I am from Mexico). So I guess that's how they managed to steal my tokens, since the theft happened a few minutes after I foolishly scanned that QR code.

[This is the unknown session in telegram. Opened a few minutes before the robbery](https://preview.redd.it/ofvdbbbj3ltd1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5b615984c94348471949e0b73bbfd3e4d4f062)

I know it is impossible to recover the tokens. I just want to ask for help to know if the theft was as I believe it was done, or by some malicious software that slipped in without me realizing it. Right now I don't know whether to format my pc, delete my TG account. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,solana,How to Trade Memecoins SUCCESSFULLY,2024-10-07 23:11:50,"So with every bull run there’s an influx here of newbies (and veterans) crying about losing their solana ports on memecoin trading. Wanted to make a post with some BASIC tips on how to be successful in this space. 

When you feel like everyone’s bags are pumping, and yours aren’t, it’s because:

1) You’re a low cap trader
You flip low caps all day. Most of the low cap coins are down bad the past couple of days. Also, if you’re doing this all thru Phantom or Solflare, you’re likely WAY too slow to make money on quick pump and dump low cap coins. You need to be using a bot (DM me for my ref link to the bot I use ;) )

2) You have no conviction bags
You don’t invest in long term holds / “cult” coins ie mini, manifest, tremp etc

What you should NOT do:

- chase green candles

Why the fuck would you chase mini at 30m when it was just at 12m mc - explain that to me

- dump ur current bags for the ones that are pumping

Just wait for a retrace

A lot of these kols arent nteresting enough to do content outside of their memecoin success, which is fine but its irritating when their cringe content gets pushed to the front because of the idea that somewhere somehow theres money on the table by giving attention to their posts.

summary ↓

an exploration of the commons scale goods that make Ethereum (network, asset, media), what underpins their integrity, and how [u/ProtocolGuild](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild) can help with that

*Thanks to* [*Barnabé*](https://x.com/barnabemonnot)*,* [*John*](https://x.com/jszcz_)*,* [*Josh*](https://x.com/TBSocialist)*,* [*Paul*](https://x.com/post_polar_)*, and* [*Tim*](https://x.com/TimBeiko) *for review.*

Ethereum is a commons like the natural + digital ones that precede it: fisheries, forests, the internet, Linux, etc. Commons are productive systems which create resources for collective benefit

https://preview.redd.it/fn8akvk03ytd1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0513922a6950641fdbb2763d2c5eeb9c9b51a31

Ethereum's three shared resources: network, asset, media

their confluence produces what we call Ethereum mainnet: they are deeply interdependent here, but altered forms make the edges of the broader commons

https://preview.redd.it/wktng23d3ytd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a330236f940f4d34094b83689d6f2d7acba69f1

these resources are produced through protocols: technical, legal, economic, social, political

complete ownership of each resource is not desirable, as it destroys their integrity. therefore, actors engage in production for influence extraction

https://preview.redd.it/4k9pd6hf3ytd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba7f5b53ba8a1e0c722c38529fab0fc78bf35936

Protocol Guild gives us a transparent, legible, sustainable and accountable funding allocation mechanism for software media production. there are 5 main threads which make it unique:

1. narrow mandate
2. broad self-curation
3. members are individuals
4. 4yr onchain vesting contract
5. designed with time in mind

it holistically funds stewardship of the entire watershed - not rivers in isolation

Commons have had a rough go under capitalism - but there is hope in long-lived natural precedents: irrigation, fisheries, farming.

blossoming digital commons should practice the posture and develop the mechanisms necessary to ensure uncaptured longevity

“Hello Sir, Ethereum is the main network for ETH and is independent of any platform. You should be able to pay from any wallet but choose the Network -> Ethereum.

I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses and I was unable to really see what he’s doing because I was really feeling ill for the past month.

The story goes like this. Some guys scam him to invest in crypto and to withdraw the money he had to keep adding. I reported them to the police but they did nothing.

Fast forward he found a lawyer on facebook and the guy said he will help him out in return of 8% of the money he will get back. Same thing, he fooled him into investing into crypto, then he said he needed to invest another 1000$ because the money had to go into a mixer. My dad did. 

I got better and I did some research on this guy, he uses a fake name and a picture of a lawyer from canada but pretends he’s from the UK. 

Now he’s asking for another 1200$ for this mixer thing which I am sure is a scam. He left my dad broke and in debt and my dad is in a war zone, things are hard enough. 

I did some research but it is truly out of my area of expertise, I don’t know how trust wallet works, but I am not stupid.

The guy claims that revolut refused the money because they were dirty, but we were using my mom’s account which he couldn’t have had access to. So how would he know that? Except that it is a lie to scam my dad?

I am sure that the money that went into the mixer went into his wallet in fact. He also told my dad that he won 18000 $ somehow which is a far strech so he would invest more.

Please help me out here.

Reddit,ethereum,Plans to reduce block rewards or raise the the burn rate?,2024-10-08 06:00:30,"Hey all,
Since blobs got introduced and regular users moved to L2s, there are way lower gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem. Time to celebrate, right?
The downside of this is a constantly increasing ETH supply and the fear, that ETH isn't seen as a good investment anymore. I know that inflation of Bitcoin is still higher rn but Bitcoins supply is capped, while ETHs is infinite.

Imo it is important for ETH to be seen as a store of value (besides all it's functionality) to attract new users. There is also the risk of the old users slowly fading away, because they feel this spiral of: less new users > more supply > falling price.

I am interested in the thoughts and discussions around this topic from the community, but especially the devs pov.

This is a follow-up to my post from about a month ago.

First, I want to clarify that I'm still bullish on Ethereum. I continue to dollar-cost average (DCA) into ETH, and I'm very close to setting up my own Ethereum node to help support the Ethereum blockchain.

My previous inquiry was about the number of developers building on the Ethereum platform. According to data from 2023, Ethereum is far ahead of other platforms in terms of developer activity, which is great news:

Read this: [https://www.developerreport.com/](https://www.developerreport.com/)

(Please let me know where I can find more up-to-date data for 2024). 

However, this leads me to a new question: While having numerous developers is positive, what tangible benefits will these developers bring to the ecosystem? In your opinion, what types of applications and use cases will they produce for the future of the project?

Reddit,ethereum,"When using Groth16 on Ethereum through ᴇɪᴘ‒197, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-05 21:22:04,"First remember Ethereum only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result… Otherwise I recognize this is more a mathematical problem but the place where I’m the most likely to find someone who do understand it remains on Ethereum as it’s partly cryptocurrency math specific.

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

We had already started developing the tool and I knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online).

About 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and I downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (I know it’s dumb I don’t need to be lectured about it I know). That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money. I don’t know what I’m gonna do from there, I’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and I was supposed to go to University next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone.

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/33gtnpdf7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=42da675ea3e71c74f71a7b294b547888e8219be3

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

🔗 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,ethereum,Dissection of an ERC-20 StableCoin: Understanding the stablecoin smart contract,2024-10-04 19:01:56,"Feeling Great!!! Just completed the Five part article on ""Dissection of an ERC-20 StableCoin: Understanding the stablecoin smart contract"".

The article dives deep into the structure of a stablecoin and discovers the hidden integral relationship between the functions and the variables.

This guide will help you understand an ERC-20 token stablecoin smart contract in depth. The article describes each function of the smart contract's intertwined contracts and shows you the dependencies among them. The dissected smart contract establishes strong security measures against prevailing smart contract vulnerabilities that can guide you to build your own ERC-20 token.

Please feel free to leave feedback after you read them!

If not, how to rework the Groth16 protocol in order to let verifier ditching a pairing e(C,vk) when calling the precompile as a gas saving measure ?",2024-09-29 13:08:58,"The non degeneracy criteria is there’s no bilinear pairing resulting in the finite field element 1 equivalent.

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

But what would happen if it would be the cases as it’s happening on some implementation that use the Ethereum’s ᴇɪᴘ‐197 precompile ?

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

I've confirmed the issues are not related to my JWT and it is not a network/port forwarding related issue.

Does anyone else have this problem with Geth? I'm ready to throw in the towel and switch to a Besu/Teku setup but damn I hate walking away from something like this without understanding why it isn't working

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

Reddit,ethereum,Account Abstraction: Crypto Beyond Private Keys,2024-09-18 14:46:04,"Chances are, you have come across the term “account abstraction,” but you don’t know what it means. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

https://preview.redd.it/uliy7j98ykpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab67cd97bb20fc124f47e8b6b274325d3462423

Let’s dive into this fascinating topic and see how it can transform your understanding of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cryhfe1bxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c156583b63dfe1fa0fbb46ca88fe2e33573ec4

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

https://preview.redd.it/d6l81mocxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af084112a700012423b3838f16662eb37501dbcd

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cio8hwgfxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20a3703848b92783e55ea0dfd73e806dba78490

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/iegallxsxkpd1.png?width=2751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb0b8618ebf50cb583ad8fddacc7bedd411d7b3

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,A bit frustrated right now.,2024-10-10 18:15:16,"Good news are not making effect, bad news are taking the price down.

Been patiently waiting and buying for 4 years since 2020. 

Finally we are supposed to be entering the phase where good news take the price upwards and bad news are somewhat ignored.

Quantitative easing and dovish fed approach, presidential candidate saying he will add Bitcoin to US strategic reserves, countries mining Bitcoin, money printing, faith in dollar declining. Still the price is doing nothing for 8 months, even doing lower highs.

But when Iran launches an attack, a bad CPI print, one government sells or has permission to sell, we instantly erase what took us weeks to recover.

When S&P 500 dumps, we dump accordingly, but when it pumps, we are left behind.

October is where previous cycles started to climb, yet here we are unable to pass 64k.

Hashrate is at ATH, ETFs been buying like crazy, all bitcoiners I know are HODLING. What I am missing?

I know elections puts uncertainty, but we are being so easily manipulated to the downside that it's quite frustrating.

Everyone is screaming ""we are about to"", ""are you ready?"", ""Soon"", ""last time we go under"".

How crazy I am to expect the ""Soon"" finally arrives?

I won't sell, I've been waiting for 4 years and willing to wait more, but anyone else is having this same frustration?

It's so obvious Bitcoin is the solution to our broken monetary system, yet the price doesn't reflect that. I don't even mind the US dollar parity, I'm talking about straight purchasing power, which today is around 55k in 2021 dollars.

How irrational can the market stay? Longer than everyone can stay solvent?

Reddit,bitcoin,Time in the market is better than timing the market ,2024-10-10 16:20:56,"I see videos of Plan B talking about how the best returns would have come from buying 6 months before the halving, selling 18 months after the halving, and then repeating that over and over again.

He claims doing this leads to far greater returns than just holding.

Here is why he is wrong and why holding is the superior strategy.

1) He doesnt take into account capital gains tax consequences from selling. When you sell you lose around 20% to 30% of all your gains on average depending on what country you live in.

2) Very smart investors have said after you take profits it becomes psychologically very hard to reinvest those profits back in again. No one wants to let go of profits they have locked in. This means most people would not be able to reinvest all the proceeds from selling their bitcoin, at best they might put half back in.

3) What happens when hyperbitcoinization and the bitcoin super cycle kicks in and there is no retracement? You would have sold what you thought was the top, but it kept on rising and you wont be able to make yourself buy back in at a higher price until its obvious the price is never going back down to where you sold, so to rebuy would mean getting half the bitcoin you once had.

For all these reasons combined simply holding is far more profitable than selling 18 months after the halving and rebuying again 6 months before the halving.

TLDR; at the end of the day you will have far more bitcoin if you just hold through all the volatility instead of trying to buy and sell based on the halving.

It's weird because I was basically a kid and never really looked into it but for some reason I saw value in it, but I didn't dare buy with my parents' money without them knowing. I wasn't curious enough to go any further and forgot about its existence until I think the beginning of 2020 where I made a first purchase and it became an interest until today. 

In fact, now that I'm thinking back, I thought about telling my parents about bitcoin and the little I knew in case they would let me buy a little, but I was embarrassed to do so because I thought they wouldn't take me seriously. I just got down on myself, felt guilty and forgot about bitcoin completely without being even a bit curious which is weird. Maybe I just should have done it.

Maybe I should have bought some on the sly, because it would definitely have been worth it today. The thing is, I don't remember what year this was to estimate if it would have been worth much. It might have been in or before 2013. I was planning on buying probably $10 or $20 worth of bitcoin. It must have been pretty early. Damn. 

The truth is that I didn't do it and that's okay. I was just a kid, but the most amazing thing is that I had the intention without really knowing or understanding bitcoin. I remember it like that. Pretty cool, huh?

My only other option was to buy some second life videogame currency and convert them to bitcoin? But again the website looked like a 90's notepad written HTML page and it was 2013, so I thought it was a scam too. 

Looking back not transferring funds to mtgox was a wise choice, but I regret abandoning afterwards and not looking harder for ways to buy bitcoin.

 I really wanted bitcoin just to have an amount in my core wallet lol.

Reddit,bitcoin,EFTs vs Self Custody (They do serve a purpose even for BTC maxis),2024-10-10 15:43:32,"Some Pros and Cons


Buying BTC and withdrawing to hold your own keys -

Pros: anonymity, and free from censorship

Cons: selling for emergencies is a taxable event. (It will likely be decades before it is accepted more freely as currency and this changes)

Buying BTC ETFs via Roth IRA -

Pros: selling is not a taxable event

Cons: Max you can buy per year is $7k. If you need to sell for emergencies, any profits over that $7k per year are subject to penalties and taxes. (Unless you are 59 1/2 and the account is 5 years old)

Buying BTC EFTs via an investment account:

Pros: exposure to BTC, without risk of losing your keys. (Generally the best choice for: the elderly, people who have a hard time learning about technology in general, those who can’t grasp the concept of self custody, people who don’t care about censorship or anonymity, or believe that BTC will ever be treated as currency)

Cons: selling is a taxable event, and no pros of BTC self custody.

Buying BTC EFTs via a company 401k:

Pros: lowers your taxable income, so more to spend on self custody, and IRA. Heavily discounted DCA due to company match

Cons: no pros of BTC self custody, no pros of Roth IRA

My personal priority order:

Max 401K company match

Max IRA

Buy BTC and self custody.

Reddit,bitcoin,On the Importance of Running a Bitcoin Core Node,2024-10-09 11:02:58,"There’s a popular saying in the Bitcoin space: “Every Bitcoiner should aim to run their own Bitcoin node.”

It sounds cool, right? But what does that really mean, and why is it so important? Let’s dive in and break it down.

To truly understand why every Bitcoiner should run their own node, we need to rewind to the very essence of what Bitcoin is.

At its core, Bitcoin is a decentralized and secure digital ledger, known as the “blockchain.” The blockchain is like a record book that keeps track of every single Bitcoin transaction since inception.

Every 10 minutes approximately, new transactions get added to this blockchain.

Now, while Bitcoin is a lot more than just a ledger (there are miners, wallets, and all sorts of exciting tech behind it), at its heart, Bitcoin is really about **decentralization and security**.

Ans where is this ledger actually stored? You guessed it—**in the Bitcoin nodes.** Every Bitcoin node runs an exact replica of the blockchain. The more Bitcoin nodes there are, the more decentralized and secure the Bitcoin network becomes. In other words, **every node makes Bitcoin stronger.**

Now, you might be thinking: ""That sounds pretty important... but isn’t running a node super hard?""

Actually, **running a Bitcoin node is easier than you think!** Here’s why:

1. **You don’t need fancy hardware**: You can run a Bitcoin node on a simple computer or even a Raspberry Pi. If it can browse the web, it can probably run a node.
2. **No need to be a tech wizard**: There’s plenty of user-friendly software out there that guides you step-by-step. If you’ve ever installed an app, you’ve got this!
3. **It’s a hands-off process**: Once you’ve got your node set up, it runs quietly in the background, doing its thing while you live your life.
4. **You stay in control**: When you run a node, you’re verifying transactions directly from the source. You don’t have to trust anyone else’s copy of the blockchain. It’s like having VIP access to the Bitcoin ledger—no middlemen, no nonsense.
5. **Support the network**: Every node you run contributes to the overall health of the Bitcoin ecosystem. You’re actively helping to keep Bitcoin censorship-resistant, decentralized, and thriving for everyone. **You’re literally a part of Bitcoin’s backbone!**

And let’s not forget the bragging rights. Being able to say “I run my own Bitcoin node” is like telling people you built your own house, but in the digital world.

Running a Bitcoin core node isn’t just for hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts—it’s for anyone who cares about decentralization, privacy, and keeping Bitcoin true to its roots. Plus, it’s easier and more fun than you might think. So why not take the plunge and become a part of the Bitcoin revolution? You’ll be helping to secure the future of money, one block at a time.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,bitcoin,Are The Crypto Centralized Exchanges Running Dry of #bitcoin?,2024-10-09 06:09:48,"A historical decline in Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchange platforms is signaling a significant market shift. Glassnode data reveals reserves have plummeted to about 2.58 million BTC, a level unseen since 2018. This trend coincides with Bitcoin's price doubling this year, prompting questions about the rationale behind this movement.

Analysts speculate that investors are increasingly transferring their assets off exchanges to safeguard their crypto holdings instead of selling. This shift hints at a growing expectation of a substantial price upswing and a desire to protect against centralized platform volatility.

The ongoing outflows of Bitcoin from exchanges not only hint at a potential surge in demand but also underscore a broader transition towards off-exchange transactions. This shift reflects a changing mindset among Bitcoin holders, prioritizing autonomy and secure asset management in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.

I'm convinced about the utility and value of Bitcoin and the importance of HODLing  but like any asset you need the ability to get in AND OUT of any asset for it to be adopted and be truly useful. For instance, I would never buy a stock or asset if I knew I was locked in for life or forbidden from selling no matter how lucrative it may be. My question is this, Can't the U.S. Government just block any exchange or customer trying to convert BTC to USD for example? What's to stop them from shutting down a RIVER or Strike or imposing a ridiculously low sell limit like 200 bucks a day or a week or something like that?  I'm already hearing stories of people trying to cash out more than 10k of BTC and getting Flagged in the process (although to be fair this occurs with FIAT transactions as well). How would selling large amounts of BTC to fiat work? (tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of BTC in USD for example) I'm concerned about this.

Reddit,bitcoin,Creating a small bitcoin mining farm in Argentina/Paraguay,2024-10-09 21:59:11,"Hi, I was wondering if I could get some of you guy's advice on this matter. So I wanted to start mining bitcoin but with my electricity rates, I don't think that that will be possible. 

So what im trying to do now, is to buy mining equipment that is really not expensive, not profitable in my area, and I want to set them up in Argentina/Paraguay, where they would be doing really well because of the cheap electricity rates.

Right now I think the electricity rates in Argentina/Paraguay are about 0.038 cents/kwh, and I have a supplier who can provide me with some s17+. He can do about 4500$ for about 120 units. With that electricity rate, each unit would make about 1400$ a year. Of course the shipping fee would be be high between 3000-6000 according to what I've seen. And there are a lot more expenses such as rent, etc.

But for the profit,  with a rate of 0.04c each miner would make approximately 1000$ a year. For 120 miners, the annual net profit, not gross, would be around 110 000$. 

So I need your guy's advice on my idea. I'm pretty excited which I understand can make me see things not clearly. I need some ideas on where I could run the miners. Should I host them, should I build a shed and run it there, should I rent a storage room and run them there, I don't know any idea is appreciated. I also need help with customs, if some people have experience with mining in other countries, what do I have to do to be able to do this legally in Argentina or Paraguay. 

Thank you very much for those who read the whole thing. The idea is still just in development so please understand that a lot of details are probably going to be missing.

  
Right now, my biggest questions are what can I do to run them over there. And how can I feel with customs (Do I have to register my business in the country, do I need a tax ID, etc).

Every idea is helpful. Please leave a message if you can, I'm taking every suggestion.

Have a good day :)",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Translated to english:



Pays daily wages in bitcoin: ""Why do we only get paid once a month?""



The developers wanted to test a new salary model. Now employees can choose to receive wages daily—in bitcoin. ""A tax risk,"" says a BI professor.



Salary models in Norwegian companies are relatively standardized today.



You do your job, and you get your salary deposited into your account once a month.



Now, the developers at the IT consulting company Snøkam are testing a new model they believe is fairer for employees.



“Why should you be paid for work you did three weeks ago?” asks senior consultant Simen Johnsrud.



The new model allows employees who wish to receive part of their monthly salary daily, in bitcoin, based on how many hours they worked that day.



Here’s how the arrangement works:



Employees can choose a percentage of their total monthly salary to be paid out daily throughout the month, instead of receiving the entire amount at the end of the month as usual.

The daily amount to be paid to the employees' accounts is converted into bitcoin before being sent.



“We asked ourselves: ‘Why do we only get paid once a month?’ and we couldn’t find any good answers—quite the opposite. It’s just always been that way, and it’s tailored to current routines,” says Johnsrud.



“One answer might be that running payroll has typically been a large manual process. We want to spend as little time as possible on manual tasks, so we’ve implemented automation wherever possible,” he adds.



Johnsrud provides an example to better explain the model.



“If an employee in the company earns 20,000 kroner a month, and there are 20 working days in the month, they will earn 1,000 kroner per day. If they choose to get 10% paid in bitcoin, that amounts to 100 kroner a day.”



Currently, seven out of eleven employees at the company have chosen to receive part of their salary in this way.



For now, Snøkam has set a maximum limit of 10% that can be paid out daily while testing the model. However, they aim to increase the limit over time.



The average percentage chosen so far is around 8%.



A bit ""unfair""



""But doesn't this just create a lot of hassle in accounting and more work than necessary for payroll?""



""As consultants, we work by the hour, so it’s very easy to see what our daily wage should be when we go home for the day. It’s also a bit 'unfair' for the employee that the company can withhold wages and earn money from it, as opposed to paying immediately for the work that’s been done. From that theory to payout in practice, the transition was not difficult for us,” says Johnsrud.



He explains that the daily amounts are automatically registered as an advance payment on the payslip.



At the end of the month, the advance payments are summed up and subtracted from the total amount.



“These amounts are deducted from what we calculate to be the employee’s exact monthly salary, so there are no errors, either in taxes or in the paid salary. The monthly reconciliation becomes the control for the entire system,” Johnsrud explains.



“So why pay out part of the salary in bitcoin?”



“Some of us are interested in crypto and wanted to explore the advantages of paying daily wages in bitcoin versus a regular payroll system,” he says.



Bitcoin is known for being a risky investment because its prices fluctuate greatly. As a result, many well-known investors and fund managers have warned against investing in cryptocurrency.



What do you and the other employees think about the volatility of bitcoin prices?



“As long as you can choose the risk you want to take by adjusting the daily rate, it’s easier to accept a fluctuating rate,” Johnsrud says.



“It’s completely voluntary for employees to participate in the bitcoin arrangement or not. We also understand the issue with paying 100% of wages in bitcoin, since it can’t be used everywhere. So, it’s good that you can choose how much you want to commit,” he adds.



A tax risk



Espen Ekberg is a professor of economic history at BI Norwegian Business School.



“This is interesting, and they are free to create the payroll system they want, but it’s strange that the company wants to pay wages in bitcoin. A common definition of salary is that the employee receives compensation in money, and bitcoin cannot be considered money. It could become that, but it doesn’t have this function today,” he says.



“Money should be used as a medium of exchange and must hold value well. The basic premise of a salary is that your labor should be worth a certain amount of purchasing power, and it shouldn’t depreciate too much over time,” he says.



Ekberg also points to a tax risk for employees who opt into the scheme:



“Those who have agreed to this will never know exactly how much bitcoin they will receive each week. But they still have to pay taxes based on their salary in kroner. If you have a salary of 800,000 kroner, and 10% is paid in bitcoin, you still have to pay taxes based on the 800,000 kroner. Therefore, there’s a clear risk if the bitcoin rate fluctuates significantly,” he says.



“Some people like risk and enjoy playing with it, but I don’t quite understand the reason for trying this. It’s very strange,” Ekberg adds.



He also notes that salary hasn’t always been paid monthly.



“You don’t have to go far to find completely different systems. In the U.S., for example, bi-weekly payments are quite normal. In Norway, we’ve also had different salary systems. Monthly payments became common when banks started offering salary accounts in the 1960s. Before that, wages were often paid weekly, in cash,” the professor adds.



“So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin”



Aksel Øvern is the CEO of Snøkam and also works as a consultant.



“Would it have been possible to do this with regular Norwegian kroner? That is, pay salaries as normal, but daily instead of monthly?”



“Payments in Norwegian kroner have some limitations since they go through the traditional banking system. First and foremost, these transactions require signing with BankID in our accounting system, which would have made this solution practically impossible. Our finance manager would have had to sign every single daily transaction for every employee with BankID,” Øvern responds.



“The traditional banking system would also have significantly limited this solution due to long transaction times, depending on the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays. The transactions we do today with bitcoin are received within a minute after the consultant logs their hours. This works regardless of the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays,” Øvern continues.



Now, he and Johnsrud hope that the arrangement will catch on, and that more restaurants and shops in the capital will begin to accept the volatile cryptocurrency as a means of payment.



“What each employee does with their bitcoins once they’re in their account will be interesting. We believe, and hope, that the adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrency over time will allow us to use these currencies for daily expenses in Norway. So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin. Fortunately, it’s located right by our office at Nationaltheatret,” says Øvern.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,bitcoin,The Global Race for Bitcoin,2024-10-10 11:41:31,"One of the most interesting aspects Bitcoin is the game theory.

Thanks to its unique characteristics (scarcity, decentralization, security, divisibility, portability, fungibility, transparency and more) Bitcoin is without a doubt a superior form of money. In fact, it is far superior to the fiat currencies we use today. Yet, because it is still new, only a small portion of global population has adopted it. 

That's where game theory comes in: Every entity in the society (individual, family, communities, institutions, private companies, corporate, public sector, nation state) must make a choice: Shall I bet on that new form of money or rather stick with the current one?

Individuals and entities choosing not to move run the risk of being left behind. Those who decide to move will enjoy the benefits of being early but also need to consider the risk (even if small) of Bitcoin being abandoned at some point for whatever reason.

What's more, financial institutions that we'd expect to reject Bitcoin the most because of their privileged position, now have to carefully evaluate the risk of Bitcoin winning and them losing by joining too late. Could that explain the confusing messages we seem to be getting: On some TV channels we hear Blackrock's CEO selling the unique merits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand we hear Jamie Dimon dismissing Bitcoin as a 'pet rock' that does nothing. Are these two really in disagreement or are they playing their own version of the game to confuse the populace while planning on getting as many Bitcoin as possible?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Realistic use of crypto in the industry,2024-10-11 06:09:03,"I recently had to buy merchandise from overseas and between conversion fees and wire fees, I spent over 10% of the total sum in fees. Oh yeah, it also took a WEEK to get there. 

It would have been as expensive as buying / sending ether but it takes 150 times longer. Outrageous.

This hit me hard, as with crypto you can send it all over the world with very little overhead, so I thought, what would it take for businesses to accept crypto ?

The only bottleneck I could think of would be the CEX's, as it happens often that they freeze accounts on a whim etc. But if the CEX is just used as a transition platform, this effect would be pretty mitigated, right ?

So, what would be the hold-back for a business to put that in place ? As far as I understand, there shouldn't be any regulatory issues since it would be the same as buying/selling merchandise trough Tradfi, but there would just be the CEX middleman.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,TD Bank's Money Laundering Settlement: Criminals Still Prefer Fiat Over Crypto,2024-10-11 05:30:12,"Yet another major bank settlement for money laundering, this time TD Bank paying 3 Billion. It just goes to show how criminals continue to favor fiat over crypto for their illicit activities. For all the noise about crypto being used for illegal purposes, it's traditional banking systems that seem to be the go-to. Time and time again, we see banks caught up in these massive settlements while crypto tech continues to innovate towards transparency and accountability, but instead is slapped around 6 days till Sunday by the SEC and other regulatory bodies that are in bed with big banks.

Fiat isn’t going obsolete anytime soon, especially in the criminal world. Despite regulations and scrutiny, these scandals keep popping up in the traditional financial sector. It's a stark reminder that blockchain tech, with its transparency and traceability, might be the solution to a lot of these issues that fiat can't solve, yet time and time again, it's portrayed as an enemy to society.

Many of these tokens are valued at billions in market cap despite having no real users, reminds me of the metaverse land craze that featured projects with just 20 active users yet sky high valuations.

Down the line, this crypto is either returned to the victim, or siezed and auctioned by the relevant government.  In both cases, the crypto is then un-tainted, and ""clean"" again. The laundry cycle is complete.

Without much they can do in terms of action against Polymarket they've decided the next step is to try and Nuke Polymarkets online reputation.

To that end they've taken to TrustPilot to sabotage the rating for the company.

# What Happened?

Polymarket hosted a Market with the title: Will Israel invade Lebanon in September? Well on the night of September 30th (US Time) Israel decided to invade Lebanon for a series of ""operations"" to push Hezbollah away from the border.

https://preview.redd.it/a26nmnd1kttd1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f87c0da486804c8448836a96359357b2a3fed76

Although the exact wording of ""Invasion"" was widespread across news outlets, **this market would ultimately resolve to no.**

# Wait, what it resolved to no? Why?

The reason it resolved no is probably up for dispute but it likely is a result of the market not ""technically"" meeting the created ""Rules"".

https://preview.redd.it/70qn49dkkttd1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c76ce668361c977b91c2dd1bb31cccc24273ad

Although the market certainly met the title requirements for ""yes"". No bettors argued that although Israel sent soldiers into Lebanon they didn't announce that they wanted to take control of any part of ""Lebanon"". So the market ""should result in No"".

# The Dispute and UMA:

UMA calls itself a 'Decentralized Truth Machine', among the many things UMA does for Polymarket one of their most notorious functions is handling Polymarket disputes. The simplified version of how it works is:

1. A dispute occurs.
2. Users make arguments on the UMA discord for why they think the market should resolve a certain way.
3. UMA Token Holders stake their tokens and vote on what the outcome of the dispute should be.
4. Some time later votes are revealed and the resolution most in favor is the Disputed Resolution.

Ignoring all obvious problems with this system like: UMA Holders being incentivized to vote for the outcome that financially favors them, and large UMA Holders being able to trade the market knowing how it will likely resolve.

The biggest and most glaring flaw in the system is the centralization of UMA tokenholders. In fact just two people at UMA control enough of the stake to lock down any dispute (if they are in agreement). **Of course this sounds like a glaring red flag so these two holders have as a result divided their tokens between a number of wallets to make voting ""appear more decentralized"".**

# The Israel/Lebanon Dispute.

In the Israel Lebanon Dispute although a majority of unique voters thought that the market should result to \[YES\].  The two UMA whales and a number of other smaller voters thought the market should result to \[NO\].

As a result the market: 'Will Israel invade Lebanon in September?' ended in \[NO\] and all \[YES\] Voters ended up losing their ""sure bet"".

The biggest individual loser was someone new to Polymarket who poured \~$420K onto the platform thinking the bet was all but guaranteed.

# The Aftermath

Beyond the immediate reaction of bettors nuking the Polymarket TrustPilot score. Losing bettors from the market are claiming that the Polymarket CEO committed a crime and deserves to be prosecuted.

Will anything else happen? Probably not... given this is just one of many controversial markets on the platform. Given a week or two this market like the rest will probably be forgotten, and news entities will continue to present Polymarket odds like the numbers are somehow a valid representation of real world odds.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Celsius lawyers are raking it in at the expense of their creditors: they are going after contractors,2024-10-09 18:03:12,"This is probably a shot in the dark.

It has been known that Celsius is pursuing users that happened to withdraw months prior to collapse, in several lawsuits that have no chance of recovering more than the cost of the legal representation of their customers.

I will provide a little more to this story. I used to work for Celsius as a contractor, a SWE. I have been slapped with a lawsuit that is laughable. They are literally full of shit, claiming that me, as a contractor, aided in the catastrophic deployment of capital that led to its demise. That my salary was unjust enrichment because I provided nothing of value back to Celsius 's creditors. I caught wind that they are also going after other entities like Uniswap for enabling pools that allowed to lose money.

Like if I ever had any kind of access to the private keys that these dumbfucks loaded in their Metamask wallets to participate in the Stakehound fiasco, the participation in liquidity mining ponzis, purchase of shitty NFT art at Opensea, or buy CEL to pump the price.

Let me tell you one thing, if by any chance you are a Celsius lawyer: good luck reaching out to this jurisdiction. I might be banned from USA for life, but you are not recovering one penny from the below-average salary I was earning. I invoiced everything and paid my income tax, and I have all the source code of the projects that I owned, along with their conversations surrounding the development.

If you are a Celsius creditor, you should know what they are doing with what is left of your money: legal theft. There is not a chance in hell that the amount of fees they are earning is going to be less than a sad contractor salary. Just 1 hour of their time is more than 30 times mine. They are screwing you and you should stop them from taking from the little that was left in this disaster.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Tibia, one of the oldest MMORPGs in the world, will allow players to trade in-game gold for crypto",2024-10-09 10:05:32,"CipSoft, the developer of the classic MMORPG Tibia, has announced an upcoming feature that introduces Tibia Tokens (TIB), a new digital token for trading in-game currency. **Tibia, launched in 1997, is one of the longest-running online multiplayer games.**

Tibia Tokens (TIB) can be obtained by converting Tibia Coins, an in-game currency, through the Tibia Token Exchange. **Built on the BNB Smart Chain and following the ERC20 standard**, Tibia Tokens are compatible with many digital wallets, like MetaMask and applications. This feature opens up a unique opportunity for Tibia players to engage with blockchain technology, blending the lines between virtual and real-world economies. 

While Tibia may not have the massive player count of games like World of Warcraft, it has maintained a dedicated player base with around 10,000 to 20,000 daily active players. Therefore, this might indicate an important step for the gaming and cryptocurrency industries, showing the potential of game economies to integrate with digital asset platforms.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Live (free) crypto rates for Google Sheets and Excel, now with API access for any app",2024-10-09 11:53:25,"Nearly 3 years ago [I made a free tool](https://cryptorates.ai/) for r\/cryptocurrency to get live crypto rates into Google Sheets and Excel, without needing to use Javascript and without any rate limits.

This service is still going strong and I've made some big improvements recently:

- Includes the data for the top 5000 coins by 24-hour volume.
- Prices are now updated every 5 minutes.
- I have [added API access](https://cryptorates.ai/api/docs) so you can use this in any application; it doesn't need to be only in Google Sheets / Excel.
- All-time high and low have been added to the dataset along with some other useful columns.
- **And most importantly: no rate limits!** You can fetch from this service as much as you like. I make heavy use of Cloudflare's free caching functionality, so the load on my server is very minimal. Cloudflare does the heavy lifting for me.

To get any rate into Google Sheets is as simple as copying and pasting this formula; for example to get the rate of PancakeSwap:

    =QUERY(IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/files/standard.csv"", 
    "","", ""en_US""), ""SELECT Col3 WHERE Col1 = 'CAKE'"", 0)

Just change `CAKE` to the coin of your choice or use a cell reference. 

If you want you can reference a rate directly like this, however the above method is better for multiple rates: `=IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/v1/price/BTC"")`

You can see in this animation how once you've fetched the rate for one coin, all the other coins will have their rate instantly appear without any *""Loading…""* text:

[Adding multiple rates animation](https://cryptorates.ai/get-rates-loop.webp)

These of course can be converted to any currency; for example to get PancakeSwap in Euro (EUR):

    =QUERY(IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/files/standard.csv"", "","", ""en_US""), 
    ""SELECT Col3 WHERE Col1 = 'BTC'"", 0) * GOOGLEFINANCE(""USDEUR"")

If you want to track the rates of a lot of coins, it's best to use [the VLOOKUP method](https://cryptorates.ai/vlookup-method) to make things even faster.

I have also done a lot of work on the documentation, so please let me know if anything is unclear or you get stuck anywhere. Docs are here: https://cryptorates.ai/

In [the full dataset](https://cryptorates.ai/full-dataset) you have access to these columns:

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Unmasking NFT Wash Trading,2024-10-08 20:50:49,"Dear community,

We're a team of researchers interested in infometrics, chainalysis, or colloquially analysis of blockchain data. I've made this account to post about our recent research on analysis of NFT trading networks and our findings in detecting potential illicit activity in NFT trading networks.  
This post is primarily aimed at providing educational material regarding NFT's and the authors are not blaming any particular NFT, creator, or project.

Traditional financial markets enjoy a significant presence of regulators enforcing a sea of illegal activity. However, most enforcing is trivial as user information is disclosed to regulating bodies linking each account to a real identity. Algorithms for detecting such patterns are not directly applicable to decentralized markets where only a pseudonymous identity is available. In other words, a user can have many wallets, and unless a centralized KYC platform is used, linking wallets to users is difficult. Prior research concentrated on examining NFT trading graphs to find recurring patterns that would indicate illegal activity. However, the ability to create wallets at fiat makes these efforts inadequate.

Our method takes a different approach. Here's how we did it.

# Our Approach: Linkability Network

The core of our method lies in the integration of **NFT trading graphs** with the entire **Ethereum Transaction Network**, creating a **Linkability Network**. Here’s how it works:

* **NFT Ownership Traces**: We track the historical transfers of ownership for each NFT, capturing every instance of trading or transfer.
* **Ethereum Transaction Network**: We extract and map the entire transaction history of Ethereum accounts involved in NFT trading, focusing on direct transfers of ETH between accounts.

The result is a directed graph that highlights potential collaborations or shared ownership across wallets that engage in wash trading. These connections, revealed through normal Ether transactions, indicate a high likelihood of coordination between wallets, even if no direct NFT trade is observed.

As commonly said, a picture tells a thousand words.

https://preview.redd.it/2ak5wznkhltd1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9555a299e406754f015e8bb8f516f40ac4b3091

The images above are examples of NFT trading graphs that our algorithm computes. The trades where the NFT was sold are edges colored red; the green edges are transfers between two accounts, and finally, the purple dotted lines are accounts historically linked on the Ethereum network. The proposition is simple: two or more accounts buying/selling/transferring the same NFT between them while having had transactions between in ETH is hardly a coincidence.

This usually happens when two or more wallets owned by the same entity/person continuously buy the same token from one-another. However, they can only do this if they have enough liquidity, or they send the ETH back and forth to fund the next buy.

The left graph shows how the first 9 accounts are all interlinked on the Ethereum transfers. These wallets were all participating in trading the token, resulting in a significant price increase. Finally, the last 3 trades are likely honest buyers that speculated on the continuation of the price action and are now holding the token, to this day, unable to sell due to lack of buyers.

Similarly, the graph on the right illustrates the same pattern amplified both in terms of value as well as trades.

The likability network was computed by following all transactions of each participating wallet until depth 4. This took a lot of time and significant computation power. For those interested, the [data of cca. 135k NFT's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/03370b71c433bfddf931292adbee759704774fa4b414174b14e3ff8946213d8b) and their graphs is publicly available, as is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16603) that goes into more detail.

In conclusion, it is unfortunate that many of the market participants were unaware about these practices. Hopefully, this post will help raise awareness about these practices for those of you trading NFT's.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,SCAM WARNING: Exorce.com,2024-10-08 11:29:22,"Just putting a post here to alert all future potential users of an exchange called Exorce. 

I feel like an idiot for not seeing the red flags early on before depositing $25,000 into their exchange. 

There is no information available about them on the internet currently and I'm hoping that this post will deter at least one person in the future from making the same mistake as me. 

After testing a few small withdrawals I deposited a larger amount into their platform. Once the time came to withdraw my funds in full they accused me of insider trading and blocked withdrawals on my account. 

I became suspicious and started researching them more thoroughly, turned out the awards on their website are fake, the company doesn't actually seem to be registered anywhere and the physical address on their website doesn't actually house their businesss.

They then said that I need to pay an ""insurance fee"" of 25% of the current account balance in order to unfreeze my account, which I did. Then they came to me again and said there was an issue with identifying the wallet which the deposit came from so I need to do it again. 

At this point I'm cutting my losses. A very bitter pill to swallow of course but I've learnt an important lesson in only using trusted and verified platforms for trading. I feel like an absolute idiot right now.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What needs to happen for the flippening and is it possible at all?,2024-10-09 12:43:52,"Everybody probably knows this but for those who dont the flippening is a theory where ETH surpasses BTC in market cap. Lots of people believe this is technically possible - But for this to happen some indicators have got to be in Ethereums favor

EIP-4844 - proto-danksharding - dropped transaction costs and boosted Layer 2s potential to scale. Arbitrum, Optimism and recently even Base are getting more volume and all of this will make Ethereum dominate decentralized exchanges - It could double its current DEX volume relative to the mainnet

Following up on the Layer 2 topic - Ethereum keeps growing through its Layer 2 chains. Its possible that Layer 2s can handle more value and transactions than the mainnet in the future - But wouldnt that have a negative impact on the mainnet?

All things considering Bitcoin is still the favorite of institutional investors even though Ethereum has dominance in Defi and NFTs. ETH has outperformed BTC in terms of price growth in some cycles and it can probably do it agan - But long term not sure if it can actually flip BTC so I would like to read some insights.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,ML-DSA secret norms?,2024-10-10 18:49:50,"I was performing vivisection of an implementation of ML-DSA and noticed that the L2 norms of the secret vectors were longer than I had anticipated. My understanding (which could be incorrect) was that for a secret to be short enough it should fall within 0 ≤ |x|\_l2 ≤ B, where B is sqrt(n) with n being the dimensionality of the lattice. 

The secrets I encountered were \~22 L2, which would be appropriate if n=512, but ML-DSA uses n=256? Is my understanding of the limit wrong, the implementation wrong, or does the modular nature of the system allow for secrets with a longer L2 norm, or is there another answer?

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Reddit,crypto,"Writing a college essay - need clarification on ""Post-Quantum"" encryption algorithms ",2024-09-09 01:30:43,"I'm writing a 250-word supplemental college essay, and I chose my topic to be cryptology/cyber-security and why it's important to me.  I've done two summer camps, both heavily focused on cryptology, and I learned about the basics like RSA and other encryption algorithms. I also learned about Shor's algorithm, and cryptology in the post-quantum world. I was under the impression that if an efficient, large-scale quantum computer was built tomorrow, we wouldn't have an algorithm that couldn't just be cracked by Shor's algorithm, but I did more research and I'm pretty sure that's not true anymore. I wanted to get your guys' opinions, on whether or not we have encryption techniques that could be implemented once a quantum computer is manufactured. 

And kinda related question, would me saying that ""in the race between encryptors and cryptanalysts/hackers, the cryptanalysts/hackers are winning"", be objectively false?",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021
Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments.

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Thank you for your time, and happy Meshing!",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);
        record.write(signature);
        record.end_size_header();
        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-10-11 12:17:59.078021

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (
        55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240,

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663
        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(p), [0,7]).order()
        115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?
