Since early December, ADA has seen its price plummet by over 61%, with bears dominating the trend and bulls unable to reclaim momentum. Despite the challenging environment, Cardano has shown signs of recovery, experiencing a 15% breakout yesterday that has pushed the price to a critical level. Related Reading: Litecoin Approaches Daily Range Peak – Can LTC Break Multi-Year Highs? This breakout offers a glimmer of hope for investors, but ADA must hold its current level to confirm the possibility of a continuation. The market remains uncertain, and the coming days will be crucial in determining whether Cardano can sustain its recent gains. If momentum persists, analysts believe ADA could rally further, providing some much-needed optimism for holders. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez weighed in on the situation, sharing a technical analysis that suggests Cardano is breaking out and has the potential for a move toward $0.83. Martinez emphasized that the next key challenge will be maintaining this momentum, as it could signal a reversal in the broader downtrend. For now, investors remain cautiously optimistic, watching closely to see if Cardano can sustain its upward trajectory. Cardano Could Start A Recovery Phase Cardano could be on the verge of a recovery rally as it finds strong demand at its current levels, with bears unable to push the price into lower demand zones. After months of sustained selling pressure, Cardano appears to be showing signs of strength. However, the path to recovery is not straightforward. Bulls must reclaim and hold key levels above the $0.85 mark to confirm the start of a sustained uptrend. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X that highlights a potential breakout for Cardano. According to Martinez, if current momentum holds, Cardano could make a move toward $0.83 in the coming days. This breakout represents an important opportunity for ADA to shift market sentiment and regain investor confidence. Despite the encouraging signs, the broader market remains shaky, with analysts calling for potential retracements as BTC and altcoins struggle to find direction. The entire crypto space seems to be battling uncertainty, which has weighed heavily on sentiment. However, there is hope that Bitcoin and altcoins, including Cardano, will begin a new recovery rally in the coming days. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hold $97K? – 1-3 Month Holders’ Data Reveals Crucial BTC Demand For now, all eyes are on ADA’s ability to maintain its breakout and push through key resistance levels. The next few days will be critical in determining whether this recovery can gain traction or if further consolidation is needed before the next leg up. Investors are cautiously optimistic, waiting for Cardano to confirm its upward momentum and break free from its recent downtrend. Price Testing Crucial Supply  Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.78 after an impressive 15% surge yesterday, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Despite this rally, ADA has faced resistance at the $0.85 level, unable to break through and reclaim critical liquidity levels above the $0.80 mark. The inability to push past this zone has raised questions about whether the recovery rally can sustain its momentum in the coming days. However, there is a silver lining for ADA bulls. The price has managed to climb above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which sits around $0.72. This is a crucial technical indicator that signals long-term strength and provides optimism for a potential continuation of the upward trend. Holding above the 200-day EMA could create a foundation for bulls to regain control and challenge higher levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ The next key challenge for ADA is to hold above the current levels and build the momentum necessary to retest the $0.85 resistance. A breakout above this zone would confirm a short-term bullish trend and open the door for further gains. However, failure to hold above the 200-day EMA could invite renewed selling pressure, pushing the price back toward lower support zones. For now, ADA remains in a delicate position, with the next few days likely to define its short-term direction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Technical indicators suggest that SHIB could embark on a massive rally once this breakout occurs, as analysis predicts a price surge of over 250% in the coming months.    Shiba Inu Price Gears Up For 250% Rally  Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of a potential breakout to the upside. A crypto analyst identified as Rose Premium Signals on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted that SHIB is currently retesting the perfect accumulation zone, representing a crucial support level that historically acts as a launchpad for a price rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu is set for a 250% price surge to new highs.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target After experiencing months of decline and volatility, the price formed a unique technical pattern called a Falling Wedge. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal signal that forms when there is a downward trend in a cryptocurrency’s price action. Considering that Shiba Inu has recorded multiple price crashes to new lows, the emergence of this pattern breathes optimism into the meme coin’s future outlook. Rose Premium Signals has shared a price chart, providing a clearer view of this technical pattern. The chart shows that SHIB is nearing the apex of its Falling Wedge pattern and is on the verge of a breakout.  A successful breakout from this bullish pattern could trigger a sharp upward movement, propelling the Shiba Inu price by 250% towards key resistance levels at $0.00002913, $0.00003612, and ultimately $0.00004401. This final price target represents a staggering 251% increase from Shiba Inu’s current market value.  The analyst has set a timeline for his optimistic prediction, forecasting that Shiba Inu will hit a price peak of $0.00004401 in the next 77 days, around April 29, 2025. On a side note, Rose Premium Signals expects a breakdown in the Shiba Inu price before this projected rally. The analyst predicts that Shiba Inu could decline and hit a final price low of $0.00001299 before it embarks on its surge to $0.00004401. This price crash is expected to occur around March 2025. If this bearish projection holds, it may present a prime buying opportunity for investors aiming to capitalize on the analyst’s 250% SHIB price rally forecast.  TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal For SHIB According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SHIB price is currently trading at $0.000015, recording declines of over 3.9% in the last 24 hours and 23.8% over the past month. While the meme coin still faces bearish pressure, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has revealed that Shiba Inu’s TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price To $0.000045?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Fed Chair Powell Just Killed QE Hopes,2025-02-12 22:00:08+00:00,"In his testimony on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dampened hopes for another round of quantitative easing (QE), reiterating that “QE is a tool we only use when rates are already at zero” and that the Fed remains “a long ways away from ending QT.” This stance challenges the notion that a quick pivot to aggressive easing might buoy Bitcoin and the entire crypto market as it did in past cycles. End Of The Bull Run For Bitcoin And Altcoins? Macro analyst Alex Krüger posted on X that “we are ages away from QE,” stressing that some market participants needed to hear Powell’s stance clearly. Another commentator, Tagoo, noted there is “no need for QE, only for discontinuation of QT,” prompting Krüger to respond that it may take “a few more months” for QT to wind down. Felix Jauvin, the host of the On the Margin podcast, commented via X: “For the QE is coming soon dreamers, I hope you just heard what powell said “QE is a tool we only use when rates are already at zero”. You don’t want zero rates and QE. That means a LOT of pain has to happen in the interim. QE isn’t coming to save your overleveraged alt bags anytime soon.” Jauvin believes the US economy has shifted from a period of stagnation to a more fundamental growth phase. According to him, “we can still see bull markets and a bid in risk assets without these monetary plumbing tricks,” since he views this as a healthier, productivity-led environment—one he calls “an economic golden age.” Dan McArdle reminded followers that markets can remain risk-on “with a decent economy and some credit expansion.” He cautioned the crypto community against anchoring expectations solely to zero-interest-rate policies and QE, suggesting that a steady economy could still support Bitcoin’s upside. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), framed Powell’s comments within “The Everything Code,” contending that QE is only one part of the global liquidity picture. While the Fed might not pivot to QE soon, Bittel pointed out that other factors, such as actions by the People’s Bank of China, private credit creation, or shifts in the Treasury General Account, can also inject liquidity into markets. “The Fed’s got other tools, and they’ve been working with the Treasury since Covid to smooth out the QT impact through the TGA and RRP,” Bittel remarked. He reminded traders that “it’s not just the Fed in this equation” and noted that Chinese rates heading toward zero heightens the possibility of China rolling out some form of QE. “Back in 2017, the Fed was a small player in the liquidity game. In fact, the Fed was doing QT and hiking rates all year, yet risk assets still flourished and Bitcoin did a 23x following the sharp but short 28% correction in January,” he added. Crypto analyst Kevin also argues that Bitcoin may not strictly require QE to thrive. However, he pointed out that “we have also never seen a macro cycle top in BTC Dominance” during active QT, casting doubt on the likelihood of a robust altcoin season anytime soon. “I still believe my analysis tells me sometime in Q2 it will end but if we take Powell at face value then altcoins season callers everyday for the last 2 years will continue to look more lost and wrong then they already are and have been,” Kevin stated. At press time, BTC traded at $96,334. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

According to Santiment data, the massive exodus that took place on February 8 and 9 represents the largest net outflow in almost two years. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’ll Regret Not Buying Ethereum At These Prices, Here’s Where It’s Headed Analysts and market observers have taken notice of this big movement of digital assets, which has led to a great deal of conjecture about the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

This amounts to the removal of billions of dollars’ worth of Ethereum from exchanges at the current pricing. 😯 There was a historic milestone of ~224,410 ETH moving away from exchanges in the 24 hours between February 8th and 9th. This was the most amount of net coins moving off of known exchange wallets in a single day in 23 months. Though more of a long-term metric, this is a… pic.twitter.com/G2e2AausPh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 11, 2025 According to conventional market mindset, such massive withdrawals frequently occur before notable price shifts because lower supply on exchanges usually pushes prices upward. However, due to its unpredictability, the cryptocurrency market hasn’t reacted with the anticipated fervor. Why Investors Are Playing The Long Game Recent withdrawal trends point to a well-thought-out plan in action. Large investors usually prepare for longer holding periods rather than short-term trades when they move their Ethereum off exchanges in such numbers. This kind of behavior shows a smart way of spending, where people are ready to give up short-term cash flow in exchange for possible long-term returns. Experts in market behavior say that these sharp changes often mean that big investors are very optimistic about an asset’s long-term prospects. Now that billions of ETH have been transferred to cold storage and private wallets, big players seem to be quietly building up holdings in anticipation of better market circumstances. Market Dynamics And The Bitcoin Factor The state of the Bitcoin market still has a lot to do with Ethereum’s current state. This makes the relationship between the two biggest cryptocurrencies very catchy. Bitcoin’s price changes still have the most effect on the market mood because they affect every part of the cryptocurrency economy. Analysts are paying attention to a few key resistance levels as they have the potential to cause significant market movement. Traders are already preparing for the prospect that a significant Bitcoin breakout may spark an Ethereum rise. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Sustain Gains—Is the Uptrend in Trouble?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Will Litecoin Bounce Back? $113 Becomes Key After Recent Rejection,2025-02-12 20:00:55+00:00,"Litecoin recent price action has left traders at a crossroads as the cryptocurrency struggles to recover from a sharp rejection at $131. After an attempt to push higher, LTC failed to hold its momentum, turning $113 into a critical level that could shape its next move. With bullish hopes now hinging on this key support, can Litecoin bounce back, or is further downside inevitable? The market is closely watching for signs of strength from buyers, as holding above this level will probably reignite upside momentum and set the stage for another rally. On the other hand, a breakdown could expose Litecoin to deeper losses, putting sellers in control. With uncertainty looming, traders are bracing for LTC’s next big move. Let’s dive into the key technical levels and what they mean for LTC’s future. LTC’s Rejection: What It Means For The Short-Term Trend Following the rejection that halted bullish momentum at $131, Litecoin has continued to exhibit bearish tendencies, struggling to regain upward traction. The failure to break through this key resistance level has reinforced the dominance of sellers, leading to a pullback that now threatens the short-term optimistic outlook.  Related Reading: Litecoin Approaches Daily Range Peak – Can LTC Break Multi-Year Highs? With $131 acting as a formidable barrier, buyers were unable to sustain the rally, ultimately giving way to increased selling pressure. Its rejection suggests that many traders are choosing to lock in profits, reducing demand and weakening bullish momentum. A decline in buying interest at higher levels indicates hesitation among investors, possibly due to broader market uncertainties or a lack of confidence in future performances. Additionally, key technical indicators are flashing caution signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures momentum, is trending lower and approaching the 50% threshold, a critical level that often determines whether bullish or bearish sentiment prevails.  A sustained drop below this level would reflect weakening buying strength and increasing selling pressure, reinforcing the potential for further downside movement. What’s Next? Possible Scenarios For Litecoin Price If the $113 support level holds strong, Litecoin may attract renewed buying interest, leading to a possible bounce. A surge in bullish momentum might allow LTC to reclaim lost ground and retest the $131 resistance level. Breaking above this barrier, supported by strong volume, might open the door for a rally toward $146.8 and beyond, signaling a continuation of the uptrend. Related Reading: Analyst Says Litecoin Will Outperform Bitcoin And Large Cap Cryptos With 11,000% Breakout On the downside, if selling pressure intensifies and Litecoin falls below $113, the next major support levels to watch would be $97.9 and $89.7.

Crypto Exchange Responds,2025-02-12 19:00:12+00:00,"There have been recent concerns within the crypto community regarding Binance’s recent activities after a claim surfaced that the exchange had been offloading large amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Binance selloff trend was first noted on social media platform X by a market participant known as AB Kuai.Dong (@_FORAB), who noted that the crypto exchange had allegedly been selling off its Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings.  Did Binance Trigger The Market Crash? The crypto market has endured a turbulent two weeks, with Bitcoin at the center of a series of price crashes. The downturn began as Bitcoin plunged to $92,000 on February 3. Although a brief recovery saw BTC climb toward $98,000 on February 11, the momentum proved short-lived. Bitcoin has since struggled to regain momentum and is hovering around $95,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Complete Largest Market Sell-Off Since 2021, Is The Top Here? Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin’s price crash rippled across the market, dragging down other cryptocurrencies. On the same day Bitcoin hit its local low, Ethereum fell below $2,470. As noted by AB Kuai.Dong, Binance may have contributed to the downturn. Data shows that crypto addresses owned by Binance have seen a drastic decline in their holdings in recent few days. Particularly, AB Kuai.Dong noted that Binance had allegedly been selling off a huge part of its crypto holdings, which cuts across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and some stablecoins.  On-chain data revealed that Binance has experienced a drastic 94.1% reduction in its Bitcoin holdings between January and February. The outflow was even more extreme for Ethereum, where balances dropped by 99.9% over the same period. BNB, Solana, and Tether USDT have also been reduced by 16.6%, 99%, and 99.9%.  Interestingly, AB Kuai.Dong noted these assets were primarily past revenue generated by the platform rather than user funds. He also pointed out that a significant portion of the sold cryptocurrencies had been converted into USDC, which has increased by 57.5% in Binance’s wallets. Binance Responds To Market Crash Allegations AB Kuai.Dong quickly gained traction among crypto traders and investors on X, particularly those searching for explanations for the recent drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. As the biggest crypto exchange in the world, a major selloff by Binance would be one of the worst things to happen to the cryptocurrencies involved. Related Reading: Analyst Says Prepare For Ethereum Price To Hit $17,000, Here’s Why However, Binance was quick to address the concerns, firmly denying that it had sold any assets. In an official statement on X, the exchange clarified that what had been observed was merely an internal accounting adjustment within the Binance treasury. As such, Binance reassured users that their funds remained safe and secure as always. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,740, having declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum is trading at $2,600 and is on a 4.2% decline in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.com",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

The approach, which seeks to fortify the business’s financial foundation, coincides with heightened turbulence in the digital asset market.

According to reports, the company’s treasury has shrunk from more than $300 million to barely $35 million, a huge drop that raises concerns. The decline comes after a series of big asset liquidations, which some say were required to keep the project afloat. This capital loss has raised concerns about WLFI’s ability to continue operating in the long run. Maintaining investor confidence may be difficult given the substantial fall in reserves. Ties To Trump Family Under Scrutiny There are also ties between WLFI and US President Donald Trump and his family, which makes things even more complicated. Some crypto fans think this is a good thing that could help them get government support, but others don’t believe so. Some people are worried that political ties could lead to problems with regulations or conflicts of interest. Furthermore, the engagement of prominent personalities in the cryptocurrency industry has historically elicited conflicting reactions. Some say that mainstream support could boost legitimacy, while others worry that it will create debate and harm the industry’s reputation. Related Reading: Final Dip?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Finds Price Stability: Reclaiming $101,000 Depends On This Level",2025-02-12 17:00:11+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to move within its one-week range after recovering from its recent drop to $91,000 but has failed to reclaim support above the $98,000 mark. Some analysts consider that BTC’s sentiment will remain neutral while it regains this support zone and builds up momentum toward a new high. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds ‘Bounce Or Die’ Level: Rebound To $4,000 Could Be Near Bitcoin Price Stability Could Lead To $101K Reclaim Following the start-of-February market correction, Bitcoin has been moving within the $96,000-$99,000 price range. The flagship cryptocurrency has recovered from its momentary fall to $91,000 and found support within its one-week range, only dropping 2% during this Sunday’s market retrace. The largest cryptocurrency has been hovering between $90,000 and $108,000 since the US Elections pump, moving in the mid-zone of its four-month price range for most of this period. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out Bitcoin’s positive performance, as it “continues to enjoy price stability” above a diagonal trendline support, a previous one-month downtrend line, broken during the latest all-time high (ATH) breakout. Since the DeepSeek-triggered correction, Bitcoin recorded price advances “that have been quickly getting canceled out, as evidenced by the recent upside wicks.” However, BTC’s price continued to hold the diagonal trendline as support over the week, which is necessary to build further momentum. According to the analyst, “As long as it continues to hold, the price will be positioned for a revisit of $101k over time.” After its most recent price action, BTC needs to reclaim the $97,700 mark to “build on this reversal with additional follow-through.” To achieve this, the flagship cryptocurrency must print a daily close above this level and reclaim it as support to build on its momentum toward the $101,000 resistance. BTC Remain Bullish in Higher Timeframes Daan Crypto Trades highlighted BTC’s range hasn’t changed, as it continues to move sideways while many altcoins have been losing ground. According to the X post, Bitcoin is consolidating while attempting a breakout on the lower timeframes. If the flagship crypto reclaims the highs from last week’s initial bounce, above the $100,000 barrier, BTC’s market structure will flip around. Daan stated BTC’s momentum is “pretty neutral” in the short term while bullish in the higher timeframes. Additionally, he pointed out that risk on sentiment will return once Bitcoin goes back into price discovery. According to Rekt Capital, BTC’s Second Price Discovery Uptrend should come in the next few weeks, as the cryptocurrency is trying to “trend reverse out of its 1st Price Discovery Correction,” which started in December.

Moreover, February has also been a historically positive month for the flagship crypto. Several analysts have pointed out that BTC’s post-halving year performance has generally been favorable during Q1, generally struggling throughout the first few weeks of the year but gaining momentum throughout February and March. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $96,091, a 1.2% decrease in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,New Data Suggests Toncoin (TON) Might Be Undervalued—Here’s What It Means,2025-02-12 16:00:45+00:00,"Toncoin (TON), which once saw significant hype leading to consistent new highs, has struggled to regain upward momentum. After a series of steady declines in the past week, the asset’s price has now slipped below the $4 mark, leaving investors concerned about its near-term potential. This prolonged downtrend has caused speculation about whether TON might be approaching a crucial turning point that could result in a major reversal in price. Related Reading: Is Toncoin Set for a Comeback? Key Market Signals Point to a Possible Rebound TON’s NMR Hits Rock Bottom: A Golden Opportunity for Investors? Amid the bearish trend, Joao Wedson, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake Platform, recently highlighted some intriguing insights. In a recent post, titled “TON Reaches NMR Lows: A Signal for Medium- to Long-Term Accumulation,” Wedson explained that the Normalized Metric Risk (NMR) for TON has hit its lowest levels yet. This indicator assesses the asset’s valuation by comparing its current price against weighted moving averages, including 50-day and 374-day averages. By factoring in logarithmic differences and time-weighted adjustments, the NMR offers a deeper perspective on TON’s market standing. Wedson’s analysis suggests that TON’s current low valuation phase could present a potential opportunity for investors. According to his findings, the NMR’s historic low levels indicate that the token might be undervalued. TON Reaches NMR Lows: A Signal for Medium to Long-Term Accumulation “This indicator, which evaluates the relationship between the current price and weighted moving averages… reveals that the TON token is in a historically low valuation phase.” – By @joao_wedson pic.twitter.com/P8ckhnSFck — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 11, 2025 For those who adopt a medium- to long-term investment horizon, this may be an opportune moment to begin accumulating TON, with the expectation that its price will appreciate over time. However, it’s worth noting that such a strategy is not without risks. While historically low valuation metrics may hint at future growth, the broader market conditions and TON’s overall adoption will play critical roles in determining whether this approach pays off. Toncoin Price Performance And Outlook Meanwhile, Toncoin is currently trading at $3.78—this market price marks not only a 1.1% decline for Toncoin in the past 24 hours but also adds to the prolonged bearish trend in TON in recent weeks marking a 22.5% drop in TON price over the past two weeks. Notably, so far, TON has fallen roughly 54% from its all-time high of $8.25 registered in January last year. Interestingly, despite this bearishness, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost has highlighted a bullish indicator for TON.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Crypto Market Trends in February: Institutional Growth, AI, and DeFi",2025-02-12 15:18:38+00:00,"The cryptocurrency market started 2025 with strong momentum, reaching a peak market cap of $3.76 trillion on January 7. This surge was fueled by pro-crypto policies from the U.S. government, including discussions on a national crypto reserve, stablecoin regulations, and tax incentives for digital assets. However, the market faced a downturn later in the month, triggered by DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough, which led to concerns about U.S. tech stock overvaluation and a broader market correction. Despite these fluctuations, several major cryptocurrencies posted strong gains, while others saw declines due to shifting liquidity and investor sentiment. Top Performing and Underperforming Assets Strong Performers: XRP (+47.8%): Increased decentralized exchange (DEX) volume boosted network activity. Solana (SOL, +24.7%): Rising DEX trading volume and memecoin speculation attracted liquidity. Bitcoin (BTC, +11.7%): Institutional interest grew amid discussions about Bitcoin’s inclusion in national reserves. Chainlink (LINK, +9.6%): Adoption of its oracle services increased across multiple blockchain networks. Underperformers: Ethereum (ETH, -8.2%): Liquidity outflows to Solana’s growing DeFi ecosystem impacted ETH’s performance. Avalanche (AVAX, -9.3%): Increased short-selling pressure contributed to a bearish outlook. BNB (-3.57%) and TRX (-6.26%): Investors favored higher-growth assets like Solana. Institutional Adoption and Crypto ETFs One of the most significant developments for February is the rising interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Following the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, 47 active crypto ETF filings have emerged, covering 16 different asset categories. The potential approval of Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin spot ETFs could drive significant capital inflows into the market, according to Binance’s February Research. Solana’s Continued Dominance in DeFi and DEX Trading Solana’s rapid growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and DEX trading volume remains a key trend to watch. For four consecutive months, Solana has outpaced Ethereum in DEX activity, marking a major shift in the DeFi landscape. In January alone, Solana-based DEXs recorded over $258 billion in trading volume, more than 200% higher than Ethereum’s $86 billion, according to Crypto Street. This surge was largely fueled by memecoin speculation, with tokens like $TRUMP and $MELANIA generating billions in trading volume. Beyond memecoins, DeFi platforms like Jupiter, Raydium, and Pump.fun have seen strong engagement, reinforcing Solana’s position as a leader in the DeFi space. Crypto Market Trends in February: Institutional Growth, AI, and DeFi Regulatory Developments and Market Sentiment February will be shaped by ongoing U.S. regulatory discussions on stablecoins and tax policies. Lawmakers are currently debating new compliance requirements for stablecoin issuers and potential tax exemptions for U.S.-issued digital assets. These policy decisions could impact investor behavior and long-term market stability. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury has introduced new regulations targeting DeFi platforms, classifying some as brokers if they offer trading front-end services. While custodial brokers must comply this year, DeFi platforms have until 2027 to meet the new standards. This shift could reshape how decentralized platforms operate and determine future adoption trends.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Ok, I'm done being nostalgic, so here's the latest news for Solana developers and founders...

# 👷‍♀️ Encode Solana Rust Bootcamp

Applications are open for the Q1 2025 cohort of the Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on March 10th.

The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.

It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.

The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.

The bootcamp includes:

1. Introduction to Solana/Rust
2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program
3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security
4. Solana Program Library/NFTs
5. Workshop Week
6. Project Week

Participants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.

*I was a part of a previous cohort, and it's a good program for new and intermediate Solana developers.*

# 🔑 Securitize Tokenized RWAs

Securitize is expanding into tokenized RWAs by integrating with Solana, and it brings some interesting opportunities for developers. 

Through partnerships with Apollo Global Management and BlackRock, Securitize has launched products like the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), which offers on-chain access to various credit strategies. 

This fund is available on multiple blockchains, including Solana, and uses Wormhole for smooth cross-chain transfers.

For developers in the Solana ecosystem, this move means you can build or integrate applications that leverage tokenized assets more easily. 

Solana’s fast and scalable infrastructure makes it a solid option for managing financial products on-chain, which opens the door for new kinds of decentralized finance applications. 

Whether you’re interested in creating secondary markets, building on-chain asset management tools, or exploring innovative financial products, there’s a growing space for real-world assets that can be tapped into.

This is a chance for Solana developers and founders to experiment with tokenized assets in a way that could attract institutional interest and bring new capabilities to your projects.

[**Securitize Brings Tokenized Real-World Assets to Ink and Solana Networks**](https://securitize.io/learn/press/securitize-expands-tokenized-real-world-ssset-ecosystem-with-ink-and-solana-blockchain-integrations?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🤝 MagicBlock x FlashTrade

MagicBlock and Flash Trade have teamed up to bring a new level of speed and performance to DeFi on Solana.

By integrating MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup technology with Flash Trade’s asset-backed perps exchange, the partnership aims to deliver a trading experience with sub-50ms end-to-end latency, all while keeping liquidity fully on-chain.

For developers, this means building on Solana can now offer real-time, high-throughput trading that meets the demands of both high-frequency strategies and institutional applications.

The collaboration eliminates the need for bridges or fragmented liquidity, ensuring that everything remains within Solana’s scalable ecosystem.

This could open up opportunities to create new, innovative DeFi applications that combine the speed of centralized finance with the flexibility and trustlessness of blockchain technology.

Overall, the MagicBlock and Flash Trade partnership represents a step forward in making decentralized trading as fast and efficient as its centralized counterparts, paving the way for the next wave of high-performance DeFi applications on Solana.

Within 1 minute the price dropped down to 0.7 erasing around 1.7 billion marketcap. When I was looking for if it’s rug pulled the top 40 wallets only owned less then 6 % of the total. 
When the first drop happend as showed in the second picture, the only major transaction was a 1.2 million dollar 700,000 token transaction which is less then 0.1 percent of the total token supply.

How did it drop by so much if the only big transaction was that one, with no panic because the sell volume was still lower then the buy volume and the chart grew back instantly.

I’m confused how 1.7billion was wiped like that with no whales? 

Same thing happend again I showed the biggest transaction on the third picture.

I have supplied screenshots of this.

This makes them very similar to what we have on hot wallets - we trust Phantom / Metamask that their software does not send information related to our keys or seed.
Infact, we can only see the audits of hot / cold wallets and place our trust.

Also, how safe are the seed phrase? you have to enter them somewhere right? if you're on smartphone, you're either using apple's keyboard or gboard to write those words - who knows our seed phrases already exist with the Apple and Google?",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714
Reddit,solana,How to buy meme coins in 2025 - a comprehensive guide for new buyers,2025-02-11 21:08:05,"When I first started buying and trading meme coins, I felt as though I was extremely overwhelmed by the amount of options available for wallets/trading/watching. It took me some time to sift through what I had at my fingertips, but I eventually found my groove. Going to try and summarize the major points I learned here to hopefully help those just learning now, especially with big coins like Dave Portnoys and Trumps hitting the market.

**Getting Started: Platforms and Trading Options**

1. **Set Up a Wallet**: Begin by funding a secure wallet compatible with your chosen blockchain.
2. **Identify the Coin**: Research and select the meme coin you're interested in. Ensure you have the correct contract address to avoid scams.
3. **Execute the Trade**: Utilize decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or platforms to swap your base cryptocurrency (like SOL) for the desired meme coin.
4. **Monitor and Manage**: Keep track of your investments and be prepared to act swiftly in the volatile meme coin market.

**Alternative Approach**

For those seeking a more streamlined experience without the complexities of traditional wallets and DEXs, there are many platforms that offer user-friendly interfaces. They allow for quick transactions using familiar methods, making it easier to navigate the meme coin market.

**Investment Strategies**

* **High-Risk Ventures**: Investing in newly launched meme coins can yield significant returns but comes with heightened risk. Due diligence is crucial.
* **Community-Backed Tokens**: Focus on meme coins with active communities and transparent development teams. These often exhibit more stability and long-term potential.
* **Network Building**: Engage with influencers and developers within the meme coin space. Building relationships can provide insights into promising projects and early investment opportunities.

**Understanding Basic Graph Trends**

One of the most important skills when investing in meme coins (or any crypto) is learning how to read basic graph trends. While the meme coin market can be highly unpredictable, spotting patterns can help you make informed decisions. Here are a few key things to look out for:

1. **Support and Resistance Levels**
   * **Support**: The price level where a coin tends to stop falling and bounces back up.
   * **Resistance**: The price level where a coin struggles to break above.
   * Knowing these levels can help you decide when to buy or sell.
2. **Volume Spikes**
   * A sudden increase in trading volume often signals big moves in price—either up or down.
   * High volume with rising prices could mean strong interest in the coin, while high volume with falling prices may indicate heavy sell-offs.
3. **Upward and Downward Trends**
   * Look for consistent **higher highs** and **higher lows** to spot an upward trend (bullish).
   * Conversely, **lower highs** and **lower lows** indicate a downward trend (bearish).
4. **Breakouts**
   * A breakout occurs when a coin's price moves beyond a significant support or resistance level, often signaling a new trend.
5. **Beware of FOMO Traps**
   * Parabolic spikes (sharp, sudden price increases) are often followed by equally sharp drops. Recognizing unsustainable trends can save you from buying at the peak.

**BIG TIP**  
Ensure that your twitter account, or your burner twitter account is optimized to receive crypto themed tweets and suggested content. Ensure you interact and follow meme coin and gem accounts.

**Final Thoughts**

The meme coin market in 2025 is both thrilling and unpredictable. While the allure of substantial gains is ever-present, it's imperative to approach investments with caution, conduct thorough research, and stay informed about market trends. Remember, while the potential for profit is significant, so are the risks involved.

*I know a lot of this information may seem redundant, but there are a lot of new users coming into the sub seeking advice and answers on how to navigate the market. This is made in order to help push them in the right direction*",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

But if all you do is **trade, you’re missing the bigger picture.**

The **real players in Solana** aren’t just flipping charts—they are **creating the future.**   
  
Let’s break down the **5 major paths**. 👇

# Solana is NOT Just About Trading

If you think **the only way to make it in Solana is by trading, you’re playing a small game.**  


💡 **There are at least 5 different ways people carve out their spot in the ecosystem:**

1️⃣ **Trading** – Learning how markets move, sniping plays, and tracking trends. 📈  
2️⃣ **Marketing & Growth** – Helping projects **gain visibility** and directing attention. 🎯  
3️⃣ **Developing** – Building **smart contracts, bots, and infrastructure.** 🛠  
4️⃣ **Building & Innovating** – Creating **entire ecosystems, not just one-off projects.** 🏗  
5️⃣ **Influencing & Content Creation** – Shaping **narratives and leading communities.** 🗣

👉 **Now, let’s break them down.**

https://preview.redd.it/9mj3vqwrfiie1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=865bfd8e23f873714e37f21ef0577ad4218f4a47

# Trading – Playing the On-Chain Game

* Trading isn’t **just buying low and selling high**—it’s about understanding the market.
* The best traders **front-run narratives, track liquidity, and read on-chain signals.**
* **Instead of chasing hype, they study market cycles and exit before the herd.**

🚨 **If you’re trading based on Twitter calls, you’re already late.**

# Marketing & Growth – The Attention Game

* **Every successful project in Solana needs attention.** Without it, even great ideas die.
* Good marketing isn’t just **shilling**—it’s about **crafting narratives** and directing the right eyeballs to the right place.
* The best **Solana marketers** create **viral campaigns, manage KOL relationships, and sustain hype.**

🔥 **If you know how to build hype and direct attention, you can make anything move.**

# Developing – Building the Tools That Matter

* Everything in crypto runs on **code.** The **best traders, builders, and market makers** depend on devs.
* Smart contract engineers, bot developers, and tool creators **control the infrastructure.**
* **If you can build, you can dictate how the ecosystem evolves.**

🚀 **The biggest projects on Solana—Pump.fun, Tensor, Jupiter—came from devs who saw what was missing and built it.**

# Building & Innovating – Founders Who Change the Game

* Some of the **biggest winners in Solana aren’t just traders—they’re builders.**
* [**Pump.fun**](http://Pump.fun) **wasn’t just a tool—it shaped an entire market meta.**
* The best builders don’t **just launch tokens—they build ecosystems** that keep growing.

🔑 **If you launch something people need, you create your own economy.**

# Influencing & Content Creation – Controlling the Narrative

* In crypto, **narratives move markets.**
* The biggest influencers don’t just **report trends—they start them.**
* Many top voices on Solana **began by sharing insights, breaking down patterns, and consistently posting value.**

📢 **If you control what people talk about, you control where liquidity flows.**

https://preview.redd.it/9i5jf78ngiie1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e1ea196f56934250dd9d73fab75fd3cf2cfb126

# Why This Matters

* If **all you do is trade, you’re playing a small game.**
* The biggest winners **create, not just consume.**
* **Traders react—builders, marketers, and devs shape the space.**

Reddit,solana,Why'd several adsresses send millions of tokens to streamflow?,2025-02-11 21:15:34,"Hi!

I was a longtime holder in a coin that I believed in and sadly sold out. The Dev is MIA, he comes and goes and gives some news and whenever his plans are not fulfilled, the FUD takes over the community and the price drops. It is a utility coin and we have been waiting for development for weeks but it doesn't come. Token creator holds 0 of the token. However, I looked at a lot of the whales in the top holders, and a lot of them send millions of coins into Streamflow. As I understand, that website is used for staking or vesting coins. However, I can't find any staking for this coin. Is this not weird? Do whales get any kind of money or is this some kind of scheme by the dev to amass coins and vest it in Streamflow? I'm not familiar with that website so sorry for the noob question.

Reddit,solana,How to Differentiate Personal vs. CEX/DEX/DeFi Wallets on Solana?,2025-02-11 08:03:38,"I'm building a bot to analyze Solana tokens, and one of the challenges I'm facing is identifying whether a wallet is a personal address or belongs to a CEX, DEX, DeFi protocol, or liquidity pool.

For example, when extracting the top 20-30 holders of a token, I want to trace the source of their SOL funds to understand their origin. However, many top holders are related to platforms like Raydium pools, MEXC exchange wallets, Jupiter limit orders, or other DeFi entities. I want to filter these out and focus only on personal wallets.

What are the best ways to identify non-personal wallets? Are there specific RPC methods, instructions, or heuristics to detect CEX/DEX/DeFi-related addresses? Any insights or resources would be appreciated!

Reddit,solana,Restaking Comes to Solana—Just Like EigenLayer on Ethereum,2025-02-11 06:24:12,"Solayer is the first restaking protocol on Solana, bringing a concept that has been making waves on Ethereum to an entirely different ecosystem. Unlike EigenLayer or Karak, which are built for Ethereum-based chains, Solayer is designed specifically for Solana, taking full advantage of its low fees and fast transactions. It allows $SOL stakers to restake their assets, providing security for dApps and L1 networks while earning additional rewards. It also introduces a shared validator model, which helps developers customize how their applications interact with the blockchain. On top of that, Solayer launched $sUSD, a stablecoin backed by US T-bills, adding another layer of functionality. In simpler terms, it lets Solana users earn extra rewards on their staked $SOL while making the network stronger and more efficient.

  
At first, I wasn’t sure how different Solayer really was from Ethereum’s restaking protocols, but after seeing how it fits within Solana’s ecosystem, it started to make sense. It isn’t just copying what’s been done before, it’s adapting the model to work for Solana’s speed and architecture. Now, with a Bitget listing coming soon, it’s clear that more people are starting to take notice. Whether it keeps growing or faces challenges, it’ll be interesting to see how Solayer shapes restaking on Solana in the long run.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,solana,"5 Best Solana APIs, SDKs, and Plugins for Web3 dApp Development",2025-02-10 14:11:58,"Solana is taking its first steps to 2025 with impressive moves and numbers, breaking its own records of daily on-chain activities and DEX volume. As a new US President's team chose Solana to launch his $TRUMP memecoin on, the network met an incredibly high user inflow, coming even closer to mass adoption. Day by day Solana attracts more and more users and developers, which makes it the most interesting blockchain in the perspective of 2025.

Not only the SOL itself but also its ecosystem projects gained much attention and investments last month. Solana already has a vast ecosystem, but there's still so much more exciting stuff that could be built.  Moreover, the biggest ecosystem’s protocols could become not your competitors but great strategic partners as most of them provide powerful APIs and SDKs that you could integrate into your dApp! So, now is the perfect time and last chance for devs to really get into Solana and build the next big thing!

# Solana Development 101: tools and tips

If you're new to Solana, start by learning the very basics, such as exploring its core architecture and native programming language. Solana's comprehensive docs, guides, and courses are your go-tos at this stage. It's also a great time to find a missing spot of the supply on the market and come up with an idea on what to build.    

Once you're over the rookie phase, it's time to discover the most powerful advanced SDKs that will make an innovation wonder out of your Solana dApp. Here are some tools that are worth giving a shot: 

# Jupiter API

Jupiter is the major DEX aggregator on Solana with a thriving governance community. It operates unique advanced routing algorithms enabling highly efficient SPL token swaps.

Utilizing Jupiter API web3 devs can access Solana liquidity the easiest way possible. Get a quote and swap easily with this powerful API. Perfectly suitable for building:

* DeFi platforms, 
* wallets with swap functions, 
* arbitrage bots that require efficient routing between token pairs, 
* Copy trading bots 

Jupiter API is your door to Solana's liquidity, and there’s no tricky lock to open it. Read till the end to know how.  

# Raydium SDK

Similar to Jupiter, Radium is also one of the core DeX protocols on Solana, which also provides an API for you to bring innovations to SOL ecosystem. Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM), that enables permissionless trading with the implementation of liquidity pools. Raydium provides a sweeping SDK for building dApps on top and swapping tokens at a lightning-fast speed. Radium SDK is your go-to tool when you aim to:  

* Create liquidity pools and enable token swap
* Build yield farming protocols 
* Retrieve data from Solana’s DeFis with ultra-low latency
* Leveraging Raydium’s AMM for token trading in wallets or dApps.

A must-have for developers looking to integrate high-speed swaps and yield farming into their Solana dApps

# Jito MEV Client  

Jito Labs provides a wide range of Solana MEV Software and products for end-users and devs alike. The core feature of Jito is a Miner Extractable Value (MEV) implementation, allowing the creation of additional earnings by optimizing a transaction order. It gains profit for validators, devs, and users.  However, MEV could also be dangerous in terms of market inequities and security. 

JITO maximizes the benefits and minimizes the drawbacks of MEV through a groundbreaking approach to it. As a Solana developer, you should definitely check out Jito if you’re building: 

* Auto trading platforms
* Telegram bots 
* Tools for validators 
* Staking and yield farming platforms 
* Memecoin sniping bots 

If you’re building anything that requires rapid and reliable transaction execution with MEV integration - JITO is your go-to tool! 

# Yellowstone gRPC Geyser Plugin

Yellowstone Geyser Plugin enables developers to use the gRPC interface for Solana. Yellowstone gRPC is a high-performance Solana plugin built around the Geyser interface supporting both gRPC and JSON-RPC protocols. 

It empowers developers to:

* Process large real-time blockchain data streams
* Monitor on-chain activities (e.g., token mints, smart contracts executions)
* Make API calls with minimal latency
* Build dApps and DeFi platforms with optimal speed and efficiency.

Yellowstone is one of the most demanded plugins for Solana development at the moment. So whatever you building - handling large data is crucial, especially on SOL, and super easy to do with Yellowstone gRPC. 

# DAS API

Built by Metaplex Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API represents a unified interface for eased management of Solana-based tokens including coins and NFTs. This API makes it possible to store some data partly off-chain which significantly optimizes the amount of data stored on-chain and enhances the speed of interaction with assets on Solana. Extremely helpful when you need to: 

* Reduce the amount of API calls
* Compress NFTs
* Optimize assets management process

DAS API is your go-to tool to keep in your arsenal when making NFT marketplaces, SocialFi platforms, DePin and RWA projects, DAOs, GameFi, and Metaverse Applications! 

# Bonus: ORE 

If your hardware and sanity are melting after numerous hours of mining BTC in vain, there's new innovative must-win mining on Solana for you to try! 

ORE is a Solana Program that provides a PoW mining interface and capabilities. Reshaping the approach to proof-of-work, ORE makes mining on the Solana network possible.  

Unlike Bitcoin mining, where everyone works on the same task but only one miner receives the prize, ORE provides personalized challenges for miners, ensuring that no work is in vain and everybody is rewarded. 

*Note that using ORE you’ll mine $ORE, not $SOL!* 

As ORE is an SPL token there’s much more you can do with it except just mine and HODL. You can build some add-ons and analytic tools for mining, integrate them into your DeFi and swapping protocols, create new tipping or payment systems, and much more!

# How to connect to them all at once easily

You can pick one or integrate them all and make your dApp almighty, but be ready that the setup process might take quite some time and bring many hassles. Not to mention that running a Solana RPC node is not a walk in the park. 

However, I found a solution that kills all birds with one stone. Check out the GetBlock - RPC provider. Their recently launched Solana PRO RPC is a powerful machine that contains a solid suite of APIs and add-ons and is being built specifically for a certain user, which means that it’s also super secure and flexible. 

Connecting your dApp to GetBlock’s Solana PRO RPC you gain access to all the needed tools at your fingerprint, including:

* **Yellowstone Geyser gRPC**;
* **Metaplex DAS API**;
* **Raydium SDK;**
* **Jupiter API;**
* **Jito MEV client;**
* **and even ORE mining interface** 

There’s also an option to set up the SplTokenMint and SplTokenOwner indexes to your Solana PRO RPC node and add almost any other extra API you need. Join me at the GetBlock Community and let’s expand the Solana ecosystem together! ",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,solana,Transfer of tokens from Token Account,2025-02-10 13:53:54,"Hello, 

  
I have received a message with a private key of a token account. They want me to think that I can access these funds and send them my own private key bla bla... (Of course I'm not gonna). But I'm wondering how do these token accounts work? It is said on the official Solana docs that every token account transaction also requires the signature of the Account Owner, no matter if it is an onCurve address or not. So you cannot make any transfers without the transaction being a multisig transaction with the account owner as a signer? Can any dev maybe chime in, I'm just wondering how these Token Accounts work in general coming from a different blockchain 😄.

Reddit,solana,"How is literally 99/100 coins, especially those on the latest list of DEX aggregators with >200k liquidity, almost always rugs?",2025-02-09 19:50:48,"I’ve been in this space for a while now, and I’m honestly just feeling so done. Every time I see a coin on the 'newest' list of DEX aggregators, especially those with over 500k liquidity and a volume of more than a million, I get this glimmer of hope like “Hey, maybe this is the one.” But no, it’s always the same damn story.

Somewhere between the first pump and the second dip, everything collapses. I can’t even tell you how many coins I’ve lost on that looked so promising at first, with huge liquidity, high volume, buying pressure, even distribution and low whales, and all the right hype. Yet somehow, they still find a way to rug. The liquidity disappears, the price crashes so fast you can’t even get out in time, and suddenly, you’re left holding nothing.

I’ve seen people talk about how “this coin is different”, but deep down, I know. I KNOW it’s going to rug, just like every other one. The cycle feels endless, and I’m honestly just tired of losing. I can’t even trust the DEX lists anymore. 

Every time I try to find something decent, it just turns into another scam. I just don’t get it—99/100 times, how are scams SO common now? Is there any real hope of finding a gem, or are we all just destined to keep getting wrecked by these scams?

Sorry if I'm too dramatic, but this was the 4th time I got rugged today. I lost 34% of my balance in just one day.

I’m starting to think I’m just cursed to keep losing until I burn out of this whole space.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

The tx sent was identical for both and just contained a simple buy request to the pumpfun program on an inactive token. The time taken includes the time taken to receive the tx confirmation using the signatureSubscribe rpc method. Helius won here by ~148k nanoseconds which equates to .148 seconds. Chainstack also gave me a rate limit error for trying to query the token balance afterwards, so it seems their rate limits are more restrictive here.

Reddit,solana,Telegrams are the ultimate meme coin killer - change my mind,2025-02-10 05:59:38,"There is NOTHING more bearish than an unregulated TG chat. NOTHING. Now hear me out before you shred me. My ultimate opinion is that TG's should be made still, and the main reason for that is to prevent these scammers in [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) threads (for those who actually use the chaotic platform to find new memes instead of some sort of pump vision platform like BullX) from convincing people to go into their stupid scam TG channels with the scam re-verify bots. Otherwise, I'd say scrap the idea of TG altogether. However, that chat should always be muted, and communication regarding working for those bags should happen in an ongoing group VC if needed. Here is why:

1. FUD is a real problem for coins. As Alfred in The Dark Knight said, ""some men just want to see the world burn"". There seems to be a certain type of meme regard whose sole goal is to ruin other people's good time. They will say whatever they can in TG's to try to kill a coin. This is literally IN ABSENCE of looking for a lower priced entry. They literally just want to kill the coin. Those that are FUDding for entry are also scumbags. A muted TG chat eliminates that problem, while still being able to have the buybot spam going and the raid links. Anyone that has anything important to say can say it on VC, if it's important.
2. The V2 scammers and the fake Safeguard bot (that asks you to ""reverify"") are getting out of hand. Like 2 scammers a minute joining talking about ""DM me immediately"" and all that shit. And the scam safeguard bot keeps getting forwarded into channels. The consequences of this are huge, and not just for the gullible regard that gets scammed. If they manage to take control of any wallets or get people to send them all their tokens, they immediately destroy the token by dumping the token onto the chain and draining the liquidity. So anyone that is holding a significant enough amount to dent the liquidity pool that is stupid enough to get scammed can destroy the token.
3. Prevent the PVP that inevitably happens when someone isn't happy a chart isn't moving up fast enough, ultimately reversing the chart. I have no emotional attachment to any token, so if I join a TG and the vibe is shit, I'm dumping the token (or alternatively not buying). I know others do the same.

Overall, there's literally nothing accomplished by having a non-muted TG chat for any token. The literal best case scenario is no TG at all, to be honest, but the pumpfun scammers get handicapped when you link a TG to the token on launch. So the next best thing is a muted TG. And for the love of god please set your buy bots to a REASONABLE minimum buy.

I'd love to hear experiences with and recommendations for:

* Protocols and projects
* Strategies for keeping track of deposits, moving funds where yield is good, avoiding tax headache
* Resources for learning

Protocols and projects I saw mentioned before:

* Aave
* Yearn
* Beefy
* Convex
* Pendle

Resources

* [The Rabbit Hole Explorer’s Guide](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole-explorers-guide/) by u/LogrisTheBard is a great read and contains the following list of places to start in DeFi:
   * Money markets such as Aave and Compound
   * Dexs such as Uniswap and Curve
   * Liquidity incentives/farming such as Convex and Aura
   * Leverage such as Gearbox, Defisaver, and GMX
   * Options such as Lyra and Hegic
   * Real world asset protocols such as Centrifuge and Maker
   * Regen finance such as Gitcoin Grants, Greenpill, and Klima

I'll add to the lists, based on recommendations in this thread.

Personally, I think I'd like to do something with USDC. I want to split a smallish amount into a couple of different protocols, some low risk low yield and also some a bit more experimental. I'm ready to loose some of my money, I mainly want to try stuff out. I'm in Germany and ideally this will not make my taxes a complete nightmare.

you can check out my other post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ics2cz/eip_for_pdas_for_dapps_programmatically_derived/ma0kago/). I'm building a dapp right now, and rely on PDAs. I would love to build on ethereum, but it simply isn't a possibility.

There's an often referred to iron triangle of ""decentralization, scalability, and security."" This is used too often as an excuse to make tradeoffs and tweaks - a rationale for why fundamental improvements aren't possible. 

PDAs are a perfect example. Yes, solana is just memecoin garbage, currently. But there are true L1 innovations, and ethereum core still seems deadlocked in an ivory tower of beautiful museum code. 

I would absolutely love to build on ethereum - i want to see the project succeed. But it's just not realistic or economical for me right now. Beyond rust, which is very nice, there are fundamental structural improvements that make creating and deploying a dapp much easier vs. ethereum. 

I will submit an EIP for PDAs shortly. I fear it will get lost in the echo chamber, but it is worth trying.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,ethereum,What Is a DEX and How To Use It?,2025-02-05 22:51:31,"If you’ve been around crypto long enough, you’ve probably heard the term **DEX** thrown around.

And no, it’s not some underground hacker group or a new brand of protein powder.

**DEX** stands for **Decentralized Exchange**—a magical place where you can trade crypto without the need for a middleman.

No banks, no brokers, no one breathing down your neck asking for your ID. Just you, your crypto, and a smart contract making the magic happen.

Sounds cool, right? It is.

But like all things in crypto, it comes with its own set of perks and pitfalls. Let’s dive in.

# What is a DEX?

A **Decentralized Exchange** is a trading platform that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional exchanges (**CEXs**) like Binance or Coinbase, which hold your funds and require you to trust them, a **DEX lets you trade directly from your wallet**.

Think of it like this:  
🔹 **CEX** = Using a bank to exchange money → Centralized, requires trust.  
🔹 **DEX** = Trading cash directly with a friend → No middleman, just you and the blockchain.

DEXs are built on **smart contracts**, meaning trades are executed automatically based on predefined rules. No humans, no delays, just pure crypto freedom.

# How Does a DEX Work? (Liquidity Pools & AMMs Explained)

Unlike centralized exchanges, which use traditional order books (buyers and sellers placing bids and offers), most DEXs operate using **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**.

Instead of matching buyers and sellers directly, AMMs use **liquidity pools**—a pool of tokens that users provide to facilitate trading.

# What is a Liquidity Pool?

For this explanation, let’s assume that 1 ETH is worth 1 USDC (even though, in reality, their values fluctuate).

Now, let’s say you have 1 USDC and want to swap it for 1 ETH on a decentralized exchange (DEX). For this to happen, the DEX needs a **liquidity pool** for this trading pair.

A liquidity pool is like a shared reservoir of crypto tokens, funded by liquidity providers. Imagine a pool containing **100 ETH and 100 USDC**. When you swap 1 USDC for ETH, your USDC is added to the pool, and ETH is removed from it.

However, the exchange rate is not fixed. Liquidity pools use an **automated market maker (AMM)** system, meaning the amount you receive depends on the **ratio of tokens in the pool**. Because your trade slightly reduces the ETH supply and increases the USDC supply, the **price of ETH increases slightly** as a result.

After the swap, the pool will have **slightly less than 100 ETH and slightly more than 100 USDC**, instead of a perfect 1:1 change. This happens due to the AMM’s pricing formula, which adjusts based on supply and demand in the pool.

Makes sense? Great! If not, reply to this email, and we’ll be happy to help!

So, in recap:

* When you swap tokens on a DEX, you're trading against this pool rather than another individual.
* The **price of tokens** in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula (often a constant product formula: **x\*y=k**), adjusting based on supply and demand.
* In return for providing liquidity, users earn a **portion of the trading fees** collected by the DEX.

# What to Watch Out for (Because DEXs Can Be Wild)

# 1️⃣ Your Funds Need to Be on the Correct Network

Not all tokens are available on every blockchain.

Some projects only trade on specific networks, like **ETH on Base** or **SOL on Solana**. If you try to buy a token on the wrong network, your transaction **won’t go through**.

✔️ **Before swapping, check which network the token is on.**  
✔️ **Make sure your funds are on that network**—for example, if you're trading on Uniswap (Ethereum), your funds need to be on **Ethereum Mainnet**, not BSC or Arbitrum.  
✔️ If you need to switch networks, use a **bridge** (e.g., Across, Stargate, or the official bridge for that blockchain).

💡 **Pro Tip to Save on Fees When Switching Networks:** Instead of using expensive bridges, you can deposit your funds into a centralized exchange like **Binance or Coinbase**, and then withdraw them directly back to your wallet on the correct network. This can be significantly cheaper than using a blockchain bridge.

# 2️⃣ Gas Fees Can Be Brutal

Ethereum gas fees can be **insanely high**, especially when the network is congested. If you’re trading on **Ethereum mainnet**, be prepared for fees that could be more than the trade itself.

✔️ **Try Layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base** to save on fees.  
✔️ **Trade during off-peak hours** when gas fees are lower.

But, if, for some reason, the token that you want to buy is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, you won’t have any other choice but to do the swap on it, resulting in very high gas fees.

# 3️⃣ Rug Pulls & Scams

Since **anyone** can list a token on a DEX, it’s a breeding ground for scams. Some shady projects launch a token, pump it, and then **pull the liquidity**, leaving buyers with worthless coins.

✔️ **Check liquidity levels** – Low liquidity = high risk.  
✔️ **Look for token audits** – If a project has been audited, it’s a safer bet (but not a guarantee).  
✔️ **Check community activity** – If it looks dead or fake, it probably is.

# 4️⃣ Impermanent Loss (For Liquidity Providers)

If you’re providing liquidity in a DEX pool, **impermanent loss** can eat away at your profits. This happens when token prices fluctuate, causing you to end up with less value than you initially deposited.

✔️ **Understand the risks before providing liquidity.**  
✔️ **Use impermanent loss calculators** to estimate potential losses.

# 5️⃣ Front-Running Bots

Some bots scan pending transactions and place trades before yours, manipulating the price and increasing slippage.

✔️ **Use private transactions** via Flashbots to prevent this.  
✔️ **Increase gas fees slightly** to speed up your transaction.

# How to Use a DEX (Without Screwing Up)

Using a DEX is pretty straightforward, but let’s make sure you don’t accidentally send your entire portfolio into the void. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1️⃣ **Get a Web3 Wallet** – You’ll need a crypto wallet like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet**. (This also depends on the token you want to swap and which wallet supports it)

2️⃣ **Fund Your Wallet in the Correct Network** – If you’re using Uniswap, make sure your **funds are on Ethereum**. If you’re using PancakeSwap, they need to be on **Binance Smart Chain**.

3️⃣ **Choose a DEX** – Popular options include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum & Layer 2s)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
* **Trader Joe** (Avalanche)
* **Jupiter** (Solana)
* **dYdX** (for advanced trading)

4️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet** – Go to the DEX’s website and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Your wallet will ask for permission—approve it.

5️⃣ **Pick a Trading Pair** – Select the correct network and tokens you want to swap (e.g., ETH for USDC).

6️⃣ **Check the Network & Token Details** –

* Make sure **you’re on the correct blockchain**.
* Double-check the **token contract address** to avoid scam tokens. (One of our team members bought fake $MELANIA, and let’s just say that he almost changed his meals from pasta to instant noodles)

7️⃣ **Set Slippage** – If your trade keeps failing, increase **slippage tolerance** slightly (usually 1-2%). Be careful—higher slippage can lead to worse prices.

8️⃣ **Confirm and Trade** –

* Double-check all details.
* Hit **“Swap”**, approve the transaction in your wallet, and wait for the blockchain to do its thing.

9️⃣ **Check Your Wallet** – Your new tokens should appear shortly. If not, try adding the token’s contract address manually.

# Why Use a DEX Instead of a CEX?

✅ **No KYC (Know Your Customer)** – Trade without submitting your passport or ID.  
✅ **Full Control** – Your funds stay in your wallet. No exchange can freeze or seize them.  
✅ **More Trading Pairs** – You can trade **new and experimental tokens** before they hit major exchanges. (That is were all the 16 year old driving around in their new Ferrari made 1000x)

We really hope this article helped you understand the DEX better, and we hope it will serve you well!

Reddit,ethereum,ETHEREUM IS SCALING,2025-02-04 19:46:53,"Over 50% of Ethereum validators have signaled support for raising the network’s gas limit, pushing it to 36 million gas units. This marks the first increase since 2021 and the first in the post-Merge era.  
  
By signaling through node configuration changes, validators enable this adjustment without requiring a hard fork. The network’s previous gas limit of 30 million, in place since August 2021, will now give way to improved throughput and reduced congestion.  
  
**Why it matters?**  
  
\> **Enhanced network throughput**  
The increased gas limit enables Ethereum to handle more transactions and execute complex operations in each block.  
  
**> Reduced congestion**  
Higher limits help reduce congestion and transaction delays during peak periods.  
  
**> DeFi growth**   
Greater capacity supports more sophisticated decentralized applications with improved uptime.  
  
**> Market Impact**   
Greater utility may add to investor demand for ETH.  
  
**Tech notes**  
Gas on Ethereum represents the computational work required for processing operations like transactions or smart contract functions. The gas limit defines the maximum gas usable per block. When demand exceeds the threshold, transactions compete for inclusion based on gas prices.  
  
By raising the gas limit, Ethereum continues evolving as a robust decentralized innovation platform, balancing scalability with network security.

Reddit,ethereum,Why are you convinced on Eth?,2025-02-04 01:59:58,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I fell into the bitcoin rabbit hole and I’m completely convinced by it. Someone just created the best and hardest store of value out of his or her ideas. I’m happy to experience this moment. I tend to say Im a bitcoin maxi.

But now on eth: The last months I put 75% of my btc on eth cause I was thinking eth‘s turn is gonna come cyclewise and I wanted to make money. And I always liked the name „ethereum“ and somehow the aura it spread, so I thought we both match.

But the more I look into it I realize I don’t share the core values of Eth. I believe in POW and not POS. I don’t see the purpose of a decreasing supply which is intended with the burns. I’m pro fixed supply like btc.

So my question is, cause maybe I don’t see the whole picture: 

what is it about eth that convinces you? 

What are the core values of eth? 

What is eth?


Thx for your responses mates.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Exciting news for the Ethereum community! As of **Jan 23, 2025**, **Wanchain’s ETH XFlows** has been successfully integrated with **Polygon’s zkEVM**. This integration brings some significant improvements to **zkEVM $ETH transactions**, including:

* ✅ **Native-to-native** transfers – No wrapped tokens or middlemen.
* ✅ **Decentralized** – Secure, trustless transactions.
* ✅ **Slippage-free** – Predictable, smooth transfers.
* ✅ **Fast** – Transactions are completed in an instant.
* ✅ **Inexpensive** – Lower fees for cross-chain transfers.

Now, **ETH** can easily move between **Polygon zkEVM** and **11 other blockchains**, enhancing the flexibility and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This integration is a huge step forward for **cross-chain interoperability**—making it easier for Ethereum to interact with other networks in a decentralized, efficient way. It's another example of how Wanchain continues to promote blockchain adoption by connecting isolated blockchains and enabling seamless communication across chains.

Reddit,ethereum,"Controversial opinion: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) should rename itself to accurately reflect what it actually does, and to stop the media from posting misleading clickbait FUD articles about it",2025-02-01 23:52:08,"The media never talks about what the EF's actual function. That would be really boring. Almost every single media article about the Ethereum Foundation concerns its selling of ETH.

I realize this is extremely controversial, but it will be better for the community to stop focusing on EF's selling when it only holds 0.2% of ETH supply and only sold 4766 ETH in 2024.

**The ETH selling is completely trivial**:

* The EF sold 0.004% of ETH supply in 2024
* Bitcoin annual inflation was 1.7% in 2024
* Solana annual inflation was 4.7% in 2024
* Every DAY, Bitcoin miners can sell a larger percent of Bitcoin than the EF does in an entire YEAR.
* Every DAY, Solana validators can sell a larger percent of SOL than EF does in an entire YEAR

Due to the **Principle of Subtraction**, the Ethereum Foundation has relinquished most of its original roles. Its remaining functions are all related to sponsoring tools, research grants, and promoting academic outreach.

If laymen knew that the EF mainly functions to **provide grants**, it would be extremely obvious why they regularly sell ETH, and no one would be questioning it.

####**The misconception is due to the word ""Foundation""**

Unfortunately, when laymen and media see the word ""Foundation"", they incorrectly assume that it controls, governs, and develops the blockchain. And then they question why an organization that does this is selling ETH instead of holding it. The media takes advantage of this to write clickbait FUD articles.

The EF actually has no control over Ethereum governance, consensus, or development. It has indirect influence over them through grants, but no direct control.

####**What does the Ethereum Foundation do?**

It consists of 3 programs:

1. **Ecosystem Support Program**: Allocates funds to sponsor critical projects in research, infrastructure, tooling, and community and education.
  - https://esp.ethereum.foundation/about/who-we-support
  - Some examples include node clients (e.g. Nimbus, Erigon, Lighthouse), research (Verkle Trees, ePBS), and tools (revoke.cash, growthepie, EVM Gas Cost estimator)
2. **Devcon**: Hosts annual Devcon meetups
3. **Fellowship Program**: Helps sponsor project grants. Identifies and fund individuals working on public goods or research projects related to blockchains (not necessarily Ethereum)

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

####**Renaming the EF**

To better reflect what it actually does, I believe the EF needs to rename itself to something like ""**Ethereum Grant Program**"". This would immediately get the media off its back.

And people will stop asking misleading questions like ""Why is a blockchain Foundation selling its own cryptocurrency?""

If they want to stop the FUD, they need to rename the EF.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,ethereum,Why can't ETH do consensus voting every 3 blocks instead of every block?,2025-02-01 04:41:40,"From what I understand, the reason there is a 12s interval between each block is because of consensus voting, and the reason each block has a gas limit is because of sudden bursts of network and CPU/RAM usage.

What if we still do consensus voting every 12 seconds, but every consensus voting includes 3 blocks? So the block time is 4s but consensus voting only happens every 12s. A 4s separation between sudden bursts of high load seems more than enough.

I heard delayed execution is on the way. It basically spreads block processing across the entire 12s, so there will be no more sudden bursts. It should allow us to have very large blocks, but it is still years away. It seems much easier to just make consensus voting happen every 3 or 10 blocks instead of every block.

I'm pretty sure there is a good reason not to do this, otherwise it would have been implemented already, but I don't know what it is.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,ethereum,Building a Simple On-Chain Orderbook DEX for RWA Tokens,2025-02-01 02:03:23,"# The Need

I've been looking for a DEX with an orderbook where I could list my RWA token for a fixed price fundraising, but couldn't find one. Here's my use case:

1. Initial Sale: I want to tokenize a real estate development project and sell tokens at a fixed price to raise construction funds
2. During Construction (1+ years): Token holders should be able to trade their tokens at prices they choose
3. Project Exit: After selling the property, I want to place a single large buy order at a fair price so all token holders can exit at the same rate
4. Capital Efficiency: All raised funds should be available for business needs (land purchase, materials, labor) without locking any portion in liquidity pools

While AMM-based DEXes like Uniswap have become the standard for DeFi, they aren't suitable for this type of RWA token because:

* AMM pools would cause price fluctuations, making it unfair for initial buyers and final exit
* They require locking significant capital in liquidity pools
* Price discovery mechanism doesn't match RWA trading patterns RWA trading often requires more precise price control and doesn't need the high-speed execution that AMMs provide. This post explores a simple approach to building an on-chain orderbook DEX specifically designed for RWA tokens.

# The Problem

Traditional orderbook DEXes are often considered impractical on-chain due to:

1. High gas costs for order matching
2. Complex order matching logic
3. Front-running concerns
4. Speed limitations of on-chain execution

However, for RWA tokens, these limitations are less critical because:

* Trading velocity is lower
* Price precision is more important than execution speed
* Front-running is less profitable due to lower volatility
* Gas costs are more acceptable given higher transaction values

# The Solution: Simple On-Chain Orderbook

We can build a simplified on-chain orderbook DEX with these key features:

# Core Design

* One smart contract per token pair
* Fixed price steps to simplify matching
* Price-indexed mapping for orders
* Off-chain order matching calculation
* On-chain order execution
* Factory contract for easy deployment of new pairs

# Data Structure

`// Price -> [Orders at this price level]`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public buyOrders;`

`mapping(uint256 => Order[]) public sellOrders;`



`struct Order {`

`address maker;`

`uint256 amount;`

`bool isBuyOrder;`

`}`

# Key Functions

1. Create Order
2. Takes price and amountValidates price stepTransfers tokens to contractStores order in mapping
3. Take Order
4. Takes existing order's price and indexTransfers tokens between partiesRemoves fulfilled order
5. Cancel Order
6. Only original maker can cancelReturns locked tokensRemoves order from mapping

# Price Steps

* Each pair has a fixed minimum price step (e.g., 0.01)
* Prices must be multiples of this step
* Larger steps mean fewer possible price levels
* Reduces storage costs and simplifies matching

# Frontend Integration

* JavaScript frontend calculates best matching orders
* Can easily scan available orders at each price level
* Simplified order matching due to price step structure
* Clear view of liquidity at each price level

# Advantages

1. Simple and predictable gas costs
2. Easy to understand and audit
3. Precise price control for traders
4. No impermanent loss
5. Perfect for RWA tokens where speed isn't critical
6. Ideal for fixed-price token sales and fair exits
7. No capital locked in liquidity pools
8. Supports both fixed-price primary market and variable-price secondary market
9. Fair and equal treatment of token holders during exit events

# Gas Optimization

1. Fixed price steps reduce storage complexity
2. Direct price indexing for quick lookups
3. Batch operations possible for efficiency
4. Simple matching logic reduces computation

# Limitations

1. Higher gas costs than AMMs
2. Not suitable for high-frequency trading
3. Less capital efficient than AMMs
4. Requires more active market making

# Future Improvements

1. Partial order filling
2. Better order prioritization
3. Multiple token pair support in single contract
4. Gas optimization for bulk operations
5. Integration with liquidity provider incentives

# Conclusion

For RWA tokens, a simple on-chain orderbook can provide better price discovery and more precise trading than AMM-based solutions. While this approach wouldn't work well for high-frequency trading tokens, it's perfectly suited for the RWA market where trade frequency is lower and price precision is more important than execution speed.

The implementation is straightforward enough that it can be built, audited, and maintained by small teams, making it an attractive option for RWA token projects that need a custom trading solution.

What do you think about this approach? Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvements.

Reddit,ethereum,Aristotle's Revenge and Cyclical Ethereum Sentiment,2025-01-31 18:49:55,"Aristotle's Revenge: Refers to the resurgence and validation of Aristotelian philosophy, particularly his views on nature and science, in light of modern scientific discoveries. The term suggests that many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas about reality, which were dismissed during the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, are being partially vindicated by contemporary physics and philosophy of science.

Let's analyze this example through the lens of ""Aristotle's Revenge,"" breaking it down in three phases:

Phase 1: Initial Praise (The Original Truth)

* The project is presented and receives recognition
* Like Aristotle's original teachings, it is initially accepted and valued
* There's an intuitive understanding of its merit and potential
* The praise suggests the project aligns with fundamental truths or needs

Phase 2: Dismissal (The Modern Rejection)

* The project faces criticism and negativity
* Similar to how Aristotelian thought was dismissed during the Scientific Revolution
* ""New"" thinking or approaches are considered superior
* The original merits are forgotten or minimized
* There's a sense that the project is outdated or flawed compared to ""better"" alternatives

Phase 3: Vindication (The Revenge)

* The project proves its worth despite the criticism
* Like Aristotelian concepts being validated by modern discoveries
* The fundamental truth or value that was initially recognized re-emerges
* The dismissal is shown to have been shortsighted
* The project's success demonstrates that the original understanding was correct

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to encrypt data inside a smart contract on Ethereum?,2025-01-30 22:00:52,"Hello, everyone!

I’ve been practicing with smart contracts in Solidity on Ethereum, and I came across a question: is it possible to encrypt data directly within a smart contract?

My goal was to use the blockchain itself to encrypt information using someone else's public key. However, I noticed that Ethereum doesn’t seem to have native support for this.

So, my question is: is there any way to encrypt data within Ethereum using another person's public key, whether with RSA, ECC, or some other approach? Has anything been developed to achieve this?",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,ethereum,How to Tokenize Construction in Argentina?,2025-01-29 23:22:19,"We have purchased a plot of land in La Plata, Argentina, and have obtained a building permit for a 4-story residential building.

We need to raise $100K for construction.

I'm exploring whether it's possible to tokenize the future building.

I want to keep the model very simple: issue an ERC20 token, 100K tokens total, sell the entire volume for 100K USDC.

Build the house, which will take approximately 1.5 years.

Sell the apartments, targeting around $300K in sales.

Distribute the net profit (after paying all fees and taxes) to token holders' wallets in USDC.

The project ends there.

In theory, this is RWA (Real World Asset). Could you suggest where I can learn about how to properly organize this? I've heard there are platforms that should help with the legal aspects, ideally with representation in Argentina.

Technically, issuing the token and creating scripts for its sale and profit distribution isn't difficult. What's unclear is how to avoid potential regulatory issues.

Is there any discussion about PDAs? Anything on the roadmap? PDAs are the kind of platform innovation that makes development easier, and adoption more scaleable and user-friendly. 

At this point, after working with erc standards forever, I am loving this PDA structure. I have to think I'm not the only one, and I don't see much interest around platform innovations for ethereum. But I would love to see an EIP for this.

Edit: Quick PDA summary if you're not familiar:


- PDAs are created by passing a program ID and an array of seeds through a hash function. 
- PDAs look like public keys, but they don't have private keys. 
- The seeds are an array of strings that can include things like the signer ID or escrow account. 
- The ""bump"" seed is used to ensure that the PDA is not on the elliptic curve, which means it doesn't have a corresponding private key. 

Why I like this
- No private keys, as mentioned
- can be used to create hashmaps and other structures on-chain, helping to structure data in a way that is easy to access and modify, especially programmatically. So they can be used to create accounts with flow control that are only accessible by a specific program.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

* Contacted Polymarket support multiple times → they close tickets without resolution
* Checked Etherscan → the ETH was successfully sent, but Polymarket hasn’t credited or refunded it
* Tried asking in Polymarket’s Discord, but no real help so far

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,The future of Bitcoin - supply shock coming?,2025-02-12 21:45:38,"600,000 BTC left exchanges last year, reducing available supply by 22%. This could trigger a supply shock, leading to a price increase if demand remains steady or rises. Investors are likely HODLing, reducing selling pressure. Lower exchange liquidity may cause higher volatility. If market sentiment turns bullish, FOMO could push prices even higher. However, macroeconomic factors like regulations or interest rate hikes could offset this effect. Overall, the trend appears bullish for Bitcoin.

If the current BTC outflow of ~50,000 BTC per month continues, a supply shock could become evident by late 2025 or early 2026. At that point, exchange reserves would drop to around 1.58 million BTC, significantly reducing available liquidity. If the outflow accelerates or demand surges, the supply shock could occur earlier, potentially in 2025. This could lead to higher price volatility and upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/yFiFeq3.jpeg)",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,bitcoin,Why using your Bitcoin as collateral for a loan is the worst idea ever,2025-02-12 11:50:31,"So there is a lot of talk in here and various other spaces online about, ""Never sell your Bitcoin, use it as collateral to get a loan out."" Reasoning behind it has been so you don't pay capital gains taxes and also get to retain your Bitcoin.

Currently live in Australia and have done research on this as an option and I have found it to be a very lacking and risky option.

We had companies like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi to name a few where a lot of people lost their Bitcoin that was posted as collateral and have not been reimbursed. For current lenders like Ledn, the collateral you have to post is double what you get back in a loan, plus you pay like a 15% interest rate on it and they rehypothecate your Bitcoin most likely and so there is massive risk of another Celsius/BlockFi collapse happening.

There are no traditional banks with insurance that offer loans with Bitcoin as collateral, in fact they do not care about Bitcoin. Also, even if they allowed it you would still have to give up custody of your keys to get the loan in the first place and are we really, as Bitcoiners going to entrust a third party with our BTC? Have we all lost the point of BTC?

Also you would not be able to service the interest repayments on the loan because having the collateral isn't good enough, you also need to have income (separate from selling Bitcoin to pay for the loan) in order to qualify for a loan in the first place. 

So I don't know how any true BTC maxis in here would recommend this as an option but every third comment I have seen is ""Never sell your Bitcoin, get loans out against it"" and as we can see that is a complete BS option.

I have not had one person comment who has actually gotten a loan out against their BTC, no one has done it, because it's a ridiculous idea.

Personally, I would rather take the 15 to 22% capital gains tax hit on selling some Bitcoin for spending, compared to giving the entire Bitcoin to some random company and getting a tiny loan back (which has to be paid back + interest) and then maybe if they don't collapse you'll get your Bitcoin back at the end of that. NO THANKS.

Let's have a discussion, am I right or wrong? Am I missing something? Are there good loan options out there?",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,bitcoin,Is Bitcoin becoming centralized in a different way?,2025-02-12 20:09:37,"Since MicroStrategy now owns around 2% of all Bitcoin, and other companies are likely to follow in the future, doesn’t this contradict Bitcoin’s original purpose as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency, even if it helps with price appreciation?

I also looked recently into mining, but with energy costs and competition rising, it’s already very hard for individuals to participate without spending more than they earn. At the same time, if corporations and institutions keep accumulating Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than using it, doesn’t that create a new form of centralization? Instead of a few entities controlling the monetary system like in traditional finance, we could end up with a few corporations controlling a significant share of Bitcoin.

Of course, some will argue that Bitcoin remains decentralized because of the blockchain itself, because no one can change the rules, seize funds, or censor transactions. But if a small number of companies control a large percentage of the supply, doesn’t that still give them disproportionate influence over the market and adoption?

Yeah, I’m personally invested in Bitcoin and see the benefits, but I’m curious how do you view this trend?

Does it strengthen Bitcoin’s adoption, or does it make it less accessible for the average person forever?",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Starting off with and example..

Bank has the only $100 in circulation. Person A makes bet with Person B. Person A loses, doesn’t have the money and goes to the bank to borrow the only $100 in existence at 10%. Where does the 10% come from if there is only $100 in circulation. How would you pay back the interest?

Traditional banking would just print it. But what if you can’t print it, you know, in the case of Bitcoin? 

If there was $200 in existence, you’d have to provide enough value to the other entity with $100 to acquire the 10% or $10 to pay back the interest… who ever is earning interest on the money ends up with all the money (just how it has always been)... 

The next question is, how do you safely lend Bitcoin for interest? Can it be done on layer II? Where it’s off chain paper essentially? Wouldn’t this create a derivatives market around Bitcoin? What would this look like? ",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation,2025-02-12 15:53:00,"I’ve always thought of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation—fixed supply, no central bank printing more of it, etc. But I’ve noticed that whenever inflation numbers come in *higher* than expected, Bitcoin tends to *drop* instead of going up.



Shouldn’t higher inflation make Bitcoin more valuable? Instead, it reacts more like a risk asset, selling off along with stocks when inflation runs hot. I get that interest rates and liquidity play a role, but if Bitcoin is really an inflation hedge, shouldn’t it be doing the opposite?



Is this just a short-term thing, and Bitcoin’s inflation-hedge role only plays out over a longer time frame? Or does this mean Bitcoin isn’t really an inflation hedge at all—at least not in the way people think?

Reddit,bitcoin,Satoshi = Elon¿?,2025-02-12 09:30:03,"Hi all, 
I dunno maybe I smoked too much weed but,
Just curious if anyone else has had the thought, that maybe, like all things on the internet... bitcoin was created by Elon or the ""Paypal Mafia"" using the Satoshi name?

The message from the UK based times newspaper on the genesis block regarding the banks failing, and requiring tax payers' money to bail them out. Just so the tax payers could access their money...  Elon's attitude towards the banks is similiar.

The 6 days between the first 2 blocks (I believe the book of ""genesis"" in the bible said it took God 6 days)...... classic Elon again.

He has almost been a salesperson for crypto over the years, like how he started accepting payments for Tesla's via crypto.

Like I said I might be stoned but this is fitting like a good puzzle peice or like watching  that movie to the end... the sixth sense.

 I guess in the end it doesn't really matter 🤷 bitcoin works 
 Just thought I'd love to hear others thoughts

🍻 cheers

Reddit,bitcoin,How do we prove that the market manipulation is happening,2025-02-12 12:02:41,"So a lot of analysts that I am aware of believe that bitcoin and crypto in general is undervalued right now in relation to a lot of the news and national accumulation by various countries. 

The fact that the price isn’t pumping they say is due to manipulation of the market but the sceptic in me thinks that using manipulation as a scapegoat for why the price isn’t going up is an easy way to create a boogie man that most people can’t prove.

I know that obviously the Blockchain is public but if it was that easy to just spot the manipulation going on surely everyone would know and it wouldn’t work.. 

So my question is and bearing in mind I am relatively new to crypto (2/3yr lurker) are there other ways to prove this market manipulation and answer the question of whether or not it’s happening and therefore gain more accurate view of the value of bitcoin and crypto. 

Or am I just asking to predict the future..

Thanks folks!

ETH is still the leading chain when it comes to smart contracts, and this first mover advantage will not go away, look at BTC, which is the best example for first mover advantage. Additionally, with the updated ETH, the network will become faster and cheaper, and even more reliant. No other chain is as reliant as ETH for smart contracts.

If ETH is going to 0, then all other alt coins will go down as well. It is the 3rd most traded coin and 3 times more than 4th place, meaning there is no head-on-head-race going on at all! Measuring on market cap, its place 2.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I have created a website that provides visualizations of transaction-speed/time-to-finality for different cryptocurrencies. Would love to know your thoughts.,2025-02-12 21:15:05,"[https://www.cryptosettlementtime.com/](https://www.cryptosettlementtime.com/)

I created this website to have place to compare how fast different cryptocurrencies take to fully confirm a transaction. Cryptocurrency settlement times, or time-to-finality, are essential to understand. They tell you how long it takes for a cryptocurrency transaction to be verified and considered irreversible on the blockchain.

For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which use probabilistic finality, confirmations are about reducing the probability of a transaction reversal. Each confirmation means more blocks are added to the chain after your transaction, making it increasingly difficult to alter. While absolute certainty is never reached, the chance of reversal becomes astronomically low with each confirmation. Bitcoin, for example, commonly uses 6 confirmations, with each block taking roughly 10 minutes, to reach a very high level of confidence in transaction finality.

However, not all cryptocurrencies work this way. Some, like Nano, offer deterministic finality. Here, a ""confirmation"" signifies a definitive agreement within the network, achieved through different consensus mechanisms. Once confirmed in a deterministic system, the transaction is considered absolutely final and irreversible.

It's important to differentiate settlement-time/time-to-finality from Transactions Per Second (TPS) and Blocks Per Second (BPS). TPS measures how many transactions a network can process per second, representing its transaction throughput. BPS, on the other hand, measures how many blocks are added to the blockchain each second, reflecting the rate of block creation. While a high TPS network can handle more transactions, and a higher BPS can increase the rate at which the blockchain grows, neither directly dictates settlement time/time to finality. The two are related but distinct concepts.

If any info on this website is incorrect i welcome your feedback, its hard to give a set time for settlement/finality for each crypto since it also depends on the state of the networks, and their consensus mechanism, but with this website i try to give an approximate number.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

 BTC will then see a resurgence, leading to an eventual actual alt-season which will end around October. 

BTC will top out at 150k-200k.

The “dip” will be caused by fears around new trading alliances being have to be built up due to the aggressive policies of the current US administration.

The run will be caused by an eventual resolution to the Russia Ukraine war, which will lead to a calming of fear and an eventual burst of greed before the inevitable capitulation of the markets and burst of the AI-bubble ala the dotcom bubble in 2001.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

fortitude, resilience and emotionless conviction to one’s decisions. Does that sound like crypto bros? 

Seriously, I think 90% of retail is looking only to get rich quick and after it hasnt happened after 3-4 weeks, oh no… the bull run is over!! Crypto is dead, paper hand now for a loss… what a waste of liquidity that could be building a strong foundation that could actually propel this market the next leg up!! 
But nooo…. Zero frickn patience! No resilience to price swings, no dedication to seeing their decisions through!! And then you cry and wonder why market cap is declining??

Here is the post where commenters are saying she called it a scam.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Looking for Games Similar to PancakeSwap Prediction,2025-02-12 18:41:17,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been playing the PancakeSwap Prediction game for a while, and I really enjoy the concept. For those who might not be familiar, it’s a simple yet engaging game where you predict whether the price of BNB will go up or down within a set timeframe. If your prediction is correct, you win a share of the prize pool. It’s like a mix of trading and betting but with a gamified experience.

I’m curious—does anyone know of any other games with a similar format? Specifically:
	•	Short-term price predictions (like 1-minute or 5-minute rounds)
	•	Crypto-based betting or prediction mechanics
	•	A fair and transparent system
	•	Decent rewards and active participation

I’ve come across a few platforms that offer prediction markets, but most seem to focus on long-term bets rather than quick, round-based games like PancakeSwap’s. If anyone has tried something similar—or even better, if you know of a platform with unique twists on the concept—I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks in advance!",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to list the Coinshares XRP ETF, arguing that XRP’s decentralized structure and deep liquidity make it difficult to manipulate. The ETF will function as a Delaware Statutory Trust, holding only XRP and cash, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP without direct ownership.

Key points from the filing:

•	⁠The ETF’s value will track the Compass Crypto Reference Index XRP (4 PM NY time).
•	⁠XRP will be securely stored by a third-party custodian to ensure safety.
•	⁠Nasdaq argues that XRP is less prone to manipulation than other digital assets previously approved for ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
•	⁠The SEC is now reviewing the proposal and seeking public comments before making a decision.

This move could significantly impact XRP’s market adoption, providing regulated institutional access to the asset and potentially increasing trading volumes. If approved, this ETF could mark a major milestone in XRP’s journey toward mainstream financial integration.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin’s Security Model is Dying – Proof of Work Was a Brilliant Start, But It’s Time for Proof of Stake",2025-02-12 16:04:15,"(*This isn’t FUD—just an honest discussion about Bitcoin’s future and the evolution of blockchain tech.*)  

Bitcoiners love to talk about **""digital gold,""** but there’s a fundamental flaw:  
✅ **Gold doesn’t become less secure over time.**  
❌ **Bitcoin does.**  

Bitcoin’s security depends on **miners**, but miner incentives **shrink every 4 years** as block rewards halve. Eventually, **miners will rely 100% on transaction fees**—and that’s an **untested experiment.**  

Meanwhile, **Proof of Stake (PoS) is the logical evolution of Proof of Work (PoW)**—achieving the same security goals **without burning entire countries’ worth of electricity**.  

---

### **🔋 PoW Was a Brilliant Bootstrapping Mechanism—But It’s Outdated**  

🔹 Proof of Work was a **genius solution** to kickstart blockchain security.  
🔹 It worked because miners had to **commit real energy**, making early attacks costly.  
🔹 But today, it’s **wasting insane amounts of electricity** just to **maintain artificial scarcity**.  
🔹 **PoS does the same job, without the waste.**  

Bitcoiners argue that PoW secures the network, but **at what cost?**  

- Bitcoin currently consumes **as much electricity as Argentina.**  
- This energy is **used to generate artificial digital scarcity.**  
- The security model **breaks down** over time, as block rewards disappear.  

And here’s the **real killer issue**:  
👉 **Every 4 years, Bitcoin’s price must double, forever, to keep miners paid.**  
👉 Eventually, the network will be supported by **only a few users paying insane fees.**  

🚨 **How expensive would Bitcoin transactions get if miners relied 100% on fees?**  
- Bitcoin can only handle **~3-7 transactions per second.**  
- Miners currently earn **~$50M/day** in rewards and fees.  
- If they ONLY relied on fees, **each transaction would need to cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.**  

👉 **Who is paying $1,000 per Bitcoin transaction?** A handful of whales? A few settlement banks?  
👉 That’s not a **usable** network—that’s a **hyper-centralized ghost chain.**  

---

### **💡 Proof of Stake: The Next Evolution of Blockchain Security**  

Ethereum **realized PoW was outdated** and made the transition to **PoS**. Why?  
✅ **It still provides strong security**—by slashing validators who act dishonestly.  
✅ **It doesn’t waste electricity**—it secures the chain without environmental destruction.  
✅ **It’s more sustainable long-term**—no need for continuous exponential price increases.  
✅ **It allows for more scalability**—since it’s not bottlenecked by mining limits.  

Bitcoiners dismiss PoS, but ask yourself:  

🔹 If Bitcoin were launching today, **would it use PoW?**  
🔹 Or would it use **a modern, energy-efficient security model?**  
🔹 Why should Bitcoin stick with **a 2009 technology** when **better options exist?**  

👉 **PoW is like the horse-drawn carriage.** It was great for a while, but we don’t need to ride horses anymore when we have **EVs and bullet trains.**  

---

### **🔮 Bitcoin Needs a Fix—Or It Will Eventually Die**
The **only way** for Bitcoin to remain secure **forever** is to add a **tail emission**—a small, permanent block reward to keep miners incentivized.  

✅ **This would allow Bitcoin to remain digital gold.**  
✅ **It would keep mining sustainable and incentivize cheaper energy production.**  
✅ **It would prevent Bitcoin from collapsing under its own weight.**  

But the **social contract** is:  
❌ **Bitcoin is ossified.**  
❌ **No major changes are allowed.**  
❌ **Even discussing tail emissions is heresy.**  

So what happens?  
🚨 Eventually, incentives **break down.**  
🚨 Maybe in **one halving**—maybe **several halvings from now.**  
🚨 But long before **2140**, Bitcoin miners will not be making enough.  

And what happens then?  
- Fees become **insanely high**.  
- Users **move to other chains**.  
- Miners **start shutting down**.  
- Security **collapses**.  

At that point, Bitcoiners will **have no choice** but to:  
1️⃣ Add tail emissions (inflation) to save the network, or  
2️⃣ Watch Bitcoin become **a weak, fee-dependent ghost chain.**  

---

### **🔥 Final Thoughts: The Best Way to Understand Blockchain? Start with PoW, Then Move to PoS**
PoW **is the foundation**—it’s how you learn about blockchain’s fundamentals.  
🔹 **If you want to understand blockchain, start with Bitcoin.**  
🔹 **If you want to understand the future, study Ethereum and Proof of Stake.**  

👉 **Bitcoin without tail emissions will eventually break.**  
👉 **Proof of Work is an aging technology.**  
👉 **Proof of Stake is the future of blockchain security.**",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Is the Meme Coin Cycle Just a Distraction to Hide Blockchain's Real Potential?,2025-02-12 13:37:40,"Why do we see so much hype around meme coins in the crypto space? In my opinion, it could be a distraction from the real possibilities of blockchain technology. For the past decade, experiments have been conducted to develop a new government structure outside the U.S. – one that leverages decentralized systems and blockchain to create a more open, efficient, and self-absorptive governance model. This was set to be deployed in another country, but it was shut down before it could happen.

Why? Because the power structures in the U.S. feared the implications. If this new system succeeded, the people in the U.S. would look at it with awe, seeing the potential for a truly fortified government structure, and the status quo would crumble. Those in power would lose their grip, and the people would demand more freedom and direct involvement in governance.

The meme coin frenzy could be an attempt to keep us distracted from this. It’s noise that drowns out the conversation around real blockchain-driven possibilities—such as decentralized governance and open consensus systems—that could fundamentally shift how we view power and authority.

While the current government systems are outdated, constrained by delays, inefficiency, and the manipulation of a few, blockchain offers the possibility of a real-time, open, and transparent structure where the people truly have control. It may not happen in the U.S. first, but it’s coming. As people begin to see the promise of blockchain-based governance, the change will be inevitable.

We are on the brink of something massive, but the powers that be are doing everything they can to distract us from it. Meme coins, in the grand scheme of things, are just the latest tactic to keep us distracted from the real potential of blockchain. It’s time we started looking beyond the noise and focusing on the future.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What's up with these tap to earn tokens ?,2025-02-11 16:34:20,"
Lately, I keep seeing these ""tap to earn"" apps everywhere basically, you tap the screen, watch ads, or do random tasks to earn some kind of crypto or in-game token. At first, it seems like an easy way to stack up some extra cash, but after messing around with a few, I’m starting to think it’s mostly a waste of time. But at the other end we can even make money lol if good luck. 
I’ve noticed The payouts are tiny. You’d have to grind for weeks just to make a few bucks.
Withdrawal limits are insane. A lot of these apps won’t let you cash out until you hit some ridiculous threshold that most people will never reach.
Way too many ads. Half the time, you’re just watching endless ads for the chance to earn a few cents.
Some of them seem sketchy. A few apps never actually pay out, or they disappear after hyping up their tokens.
I feel like these apps are just farming user engagement and ad revenue while making it seem like you're earning something. Has anyone actually made decent money from one of these, or are they all just a trap? Curious to hear real experiences. Recently came accross tapswap. Before it was ton and midas yield which i tried . But kinda confused because So many are still coming in market.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Are memecoins a money glitch?,2025-02-12 01:06:36,"
So you make a memecoin on Solana and you make a liquidity pool with only 10% of all tokens and like 10 SOL. You keep 90% of the supply and slowly lock tokens into the LP. 

Steps after memecoin creation: 
1. promote the crap out of it 
2. use the trading fees to continually add to the liquidity pool 
3. Keep control of 40% of tokens 
4. 50% being in the lp and 10% circulating 

Could you eventually create coin with actual value? Is it possible to set an actual floor price for a memecoin?? Is there math that supports this?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Nobel Economist Labels Bitcoin “A Financial Black Hole”,2025-02-10 20:59:49,""" Eugene F. Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, sees zero value in Bitcoin, calling it nothing but an empty vacuum.

Appearing on the Capitalis’t podcast, Eugene Fama delivered his verdict: Bitcoin is doomed. While the crypto world has heard plenty of these eulogies before, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds.

Fama ridiculed the idea of a blockchain-based financial system, likening it to boiling soup over a fire made from plastic bottles—expensive, inefficient, and environmentally reckless. He sees Bitcoin as a wild card in monetary theory, unpredictable and undeserving of attention. And the idea that it’s “digital gold”? He’s not buying it. 

“Cryptocurrencies are such a puzzle because they violate all the rules of a medium of exchange,” Fama said. “They don't have a stable real value. They have highly variable real value. That kind of a medium of exchange is not supposed to survive,” he concluded.""

*Is E. Fama right about Bitcoin being worthless, or is he way off? What do you think guys?*

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,2025-02-04 16:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-13 00:52:49.663714

Reddit,crypto,A mnemonic system to (almost) effortlessly memorize 128-bit of entropy,2024-12-28 12:47:51,"Hi,

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
