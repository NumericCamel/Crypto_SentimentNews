As a Layer-2 platform on the Solana blockchain, the Grass platform allows users to share unused internet bandwidth to train AI models using a browser extension. With its promising technology, it’s no surprise that its token launch and airdrop last October 28th was highly anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? While the airdrop was marred by a few issues, including a three-hour outage, the token’s price rally succeeded. Last October 29th, the token peaked at October 29th, then made a massive rally from October 31st until November 2nd, breaching the $1.50 level. After hitting a high of $1.9175 on November 2nd, it has slowed down, settled below the $1.75 level, and now trades at the $1.45 level. GRASS has rejected the $2 price, with analysts seeing a deeper pullback—so, is this the right time to buy? A Rough Start For GRASS Trading for GRASS started on October 28th, but a few issues delayed the token’s airdrop and launch. The team recorded technical issues, including users being prevented from accessing their tokens on their Phantom wallets. Also, the rush to claim the tokens was marred by the three-hour power interruption. Furthermore, some users reported flagged transactions, and many were disqualified from the airdrop. WTF is this @getgrass_io @grassfdn I’m using it since Epoch 1 and after 10 months of using, it is saying that your wallet is not eligible?? Really?#grassairdrop #grassfoundation #grassSCAM pic.twitter.com/wt7BWPBI1R — Phantom Soul (@PhantomSoulll) October 28, 2024 A total of 1 billion GRASS tokens were circulated, and 10% were given to early supporters and contributors. It’s still too early to see the full extent of these issues’ effect on GRASS, but the token started well price-wise. Token Tries To Breach $2 It’s challenging to make sense of GRASS’s price action since it only launched a few days ago. However, analysts see a bullish trend on the chart’s lower timeframes. The token boasts above-average volume in the last 24 hours. Also, the token’s on-balance volume and price increased starting October 30th. In short, there was buying pressure for the token, suggesting that price gains may happen soon. However, GRASS rejected $2, making it the token’s short-term psychological resistance. Analysts said the price could dip to $1.75 since the RSI reflects a bearish divergence. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Other Analysts See A Deeper Dive For GRASS Based on the technical charts, the analysts found two notable liquidity pools at prices of $1.56 and $1.96. The current price is currently closer to the liquidity pool at $1.56, with the token appearing to reject the $1.96 level. Since there’s a bearish momentum and a liquidity pool at $1.56, traders and holders can expect a price dip below $1,75. Swing traders and new buyers who want to enter a position can wait for the token’s retesting of $1.56 or even $1.4. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

After its rally, which gained 35% over the past 60 days, the popular Layer 1 blockchain is back in the news with more on-chain activities. According to recent data, Solana’s DeFi Total Value Locked or TVL increased to $5.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 26% improvement from the previous quarter. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Kamino, a crypto lending service, leads the count with $1.5 billion in TVL and an impressive 7% Quarter-on-Quarter growth, helped by jupSOL and PYUSD additions. Recent data also suggests that Solana’s market cap is now $3.8 billion, an improvement of 23%, boosted by the integration of PayPal’s PYUSD. DeFI Continues To Drive Growth For Solana Solana DeFi tops the chain’s activities with a total locked value, worth $5.7 billion. This latest SOL data reflects a solid 26% growth QoQ, pushing the blockchain to become third largest in this metric, surpassing Tron. In a Messari report, Solana’s TVL increased due to increased activities for Kamino, which accounted for $1.5 billion of the total contracts locked. Kamino’s recent quarterly figure represents a 57% rise, thanks to the recent integration of jupSOL and PYUSD. Aside from Kamino Finance, Solana’s blockchain featured locked assets for Raydium, with $1.1 billion, and Jupiter, with $749 million. Kamino Finance’s impressive performance is linked to its Kamino Lend V2 launch, offering a permissionless vault and market layer. Analysts expect Kamino Finance to continue its dominance by adding new projects like the Spot Leverage and Lending Orderbook. Solana DEX Shows Signs Of Slowing Down Solana’s DEX activity was down 10% QoQ but rebounded a bit by October. The average daily volume on the blockchain’s exchange hit $1.7 billion, largely because of a fall in meme coins. Raydium retains its dominance on Solana’s DEX, with a 51% market share, although its daily average volume dipped by 13% to $852 million. The volume increased by $350 million with the release of Moonshot, a crypto mobile trading app. Jupiter also stayed at the top, cornering 43% of the total spot exchange volume. Recent developments, including the release of Jupiter Mobile and the integration of Google Pay and Apple Pay, helped the platform.

SOL’s Stablecoins Get Help From PYUSD In the same Messari report, PayPal’s PYUSD lifts SOL’s stablecoin market. The PYUSD was launched in May in Solana, which is mainly instrumental in its market cap growth, which now stands at $3.8 billion. With exciting features like programmable transfers and transfer hooks, PayPal’s PYUSD became instantly popular. Aside from PYUSD, USDC also contributes to Solana’s stablecoins market. Circle’s integration of Web 3.0 services for SOL provides enterprise functionality features like fee sponsorship and programmable wallets, allowing developers to integrate multi-chain solutions quickly.

According to price data, Bitcoin has just completed a retest of the downward sloping trendline that has limited its price rallies since March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? As analyst EGRAG CRYPTO pointed out, the only thing left is for a complete body closure on the weekly timeframe. This closure will be pivotal in determining the next phase of Bitcoin’s price action, potentially setting the stage for a rally into new price territories. Bitcoin Completes Trendline Retest Technical analysis of the Bitcoin price indicates a breakout from a resistance trendline in the middle of October. Although this breakout saw the crypto breaking above $68,000 for the first time in three months, a consolidation shortly after suggested the work wasn’t done yet.  However, Bitcoin started the just concluded week on a good form. Particularly, BTC rallied in the last three days of October from $66,900 on October 27 until it reached $73,540 on October 29. This represented an increase of about 10% in just two days. Interestingly, this was enough to complete a successful breakout of this resistance trendline. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin has successfully broken out and confirmed a retest phase. However, the breakout noted by the analyst is in a larger timeframe on the weekly candlestick chart. Looking at the Bitcoin price chart below, the initial breakout noted by EGRAG CRYPTO goes as far back as February 2024, when the top coin broke out above $47,000.  What this means is that when looking at the weekly timeframe, Bitcoin’s journey to the peak/all-time high of $73,737 on March 14, the correction up until a low of $49,800 on August 5, and the recent return above $73,000 are all part of one large breakout and retest move that has played out for the last 38 weeks.  What’s Next For Bitcoin? This sequence of price movements paints a picture of Bitcoin’s resilience and a prevalent bullish sentiment among traders. According to EGRAG, the pattern is super bullish and he expects the crypto to continue on this run. In terms of a price target, the analyst suggested a potential rise to the $90,000 to the $110,000 range by December 2024. This represents 32% and 62% returns, respectively, from the $68,000 breakout. Interestingly, EGRAG also noted that the only thing left to certify this run is for the price to close the week in a green zone.  Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $68,500, down by about 1.9% in the past 24 hours.

This negative price action drives more attention to the largest digital asset, especially with the US election fast approaching. While many analysts are now skeptical of Bitcoin’s immediate movements, pro-trader Justin Bennett already issued a cautionary insight into the asset’s future. Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin During The US Election, Expert Reveals Bitcoin Breaches Crucial $69,000 Support Zone In an X post on November 1, Bennet shared an analysis of the BTC market, proclaiming the dip below $70,000 as a concerning development. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency had risen by over 23% in the past three weeks to trade briefly above $73,000 before experiencing a pullback to around $69,000 on Friday. Interestingly, Bennet stated that $69,000 represented a critical support zone for Bitcoin. He emphasized the importance of the token’s value staying above this price level, describing it as the “last line of defense” for the market bulls. In the last few hours, Bitcoin has fallen below $69,000 reaching around $67,900. According to Bennet’s prediction,  Bitcoin could now slump as low as $65,000 where its next major resistance lies. Importantly, such a decline will indicate the digital asset has yet to break out of a consolidation range stretching over the last eight months. In terms of future price gains, Bennet has stated his expectations of Bitcoin to eventually surpass its all-time high (ATH) at $73,750, albeit he remains uncertain of how low the asset will trade before achieving this feat.  Since hitting its ATH in March, Bitcoin has only produced a range-bound price movement between $55,000-$72,000 even despite positive market indicators such as Fed rate cuts and significantly high inflows in the Spot Bitcoin ETF market. However, a traditionally bullish Q4, the potential of sustained heightened ETF inflows, and the upcoming US election signals an imminent possible price breakout for the crypto market leader.

While there is still the possibility of further price losses before D-day on November 5, investors are likely to be unfazed as Bitcoin’s price has always gone parabolic after the elections. At the time of writing, the crypto market leader continues to trade around $68,175 following a 2.52% loss in the past day. However, the daily trading volume is down by 53.91% and is valued at $21.76 billion. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Solana Likely To Target $200 ‘If It Holds Current Support’ – What To Expect,2024-11-03 16:00:56+00:00,"Solana (SOL) is currently trading at a crucial demand level near $163, following a retrace from local highs around $183. This price is a critical support area that could determine the direction of SOL’s upcoming price action. Losing this level could signal a deeper correction, which would intensify selling pressure and potentially push SOL to retest lower support levels. However, top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis suggesting that if SOL can hold this “green zone” around $160, it could pave the way for a rebound. Daan notes that in the most optimistic scenario, SOL could hold this support and start a gradual climb, ultimately aiming to test the downtrend line that has kept it in check. This setup would keep SOL’s bullish structure intact, creating a potential entry point for investors eyeing a bounce. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL? With the broader crypto market showing volatility and Solana facing this pivotal level, the next few days will be crucial. Traders and investors are closely watching to see if this demand zone can support a reversal, potentially leading SOL back toward recent highs. Solana Holding Strong Despite Uncertainty Solana (SOL) has managed to hold above the key support level around $160, despite the recent market volatility and uncertainty. This level is crucial for SOL’s price structure, as it’s a strong demand zone that could act as a foundation for the next upward move.  Crypto analyst Daan recently shared his perspective on X, revealing that SOL’s “most bullish case” would be for it to hold this “green zone” around $160, allowing it to gradually grind back up toward the descending trendline that has capped recent gains. In Daan’s view, the next attempt at this trendline could likely result in a successful breakout, with the potential to push SOL’s price above $200. He suggests that waiting for confirmation of this breakout could be a sound strategy for cautious investors, as there is still ample room for upside even after a confirmed reversal. His analysis highlights a confident outlook on SOL’s potential recovery, seeing this accumulation zone as a promising buying opportunity. However, Daan also acknowledges that there’s still a degree of downside risk. If SOL fails to hold above this $160 level, a deeper correction could follow, potentially driving SOL to test lower support levels.  Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? For now, the market will watch this support level closely as a critical indicator of SOL’s short-term trend. Holding above it would signal strength and open the door for a potential rally, while a breakdown could lead to a more extended bearish phase. As the overall market sentiment remains mixed, Solana’s next moves will be critical for traders and investors alike. SOL Price Action  Solana is currently trading at $163 after tagging the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA), a critical indicator of short-term strength. Holding above this EMA signals a bullish outlook for SOL, suggesting that buyers are stepping in to support the price at this level. If SOL can maintain momentum above the 200 EMA, it could build a foundation for a potential rally to new local highs, possibly challenging the recent peak around $183. However, the $160 level remains a crucial support area. Losing this support would likely trigger significant selling pressure, potentially driving SOL down to the $150 range, where further demand may emerge. This zone would be closely watched by investors looking for potential accumulation opportunities, as a dip could provide favorable entry points for long-term holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? In contrast, a strong push above the current demand level would confirm renewed bullish momentum, paving the way for SOL to target and possibly surpass recent highs.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Spot ETFs Fail To Ignite Bitcoin Growth – Analyst,2024-11-03 14:00:30+00:00,"The Spot Bitcoin ETFs have become a major headliner recently due to heightened levels of market inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, these ETFs have attracted over $5 billion in investments over the past three weeks coinciding with an impressive Bitcoin price rally of over 23%. However, amidst this euphoria, macro investment researcher Jim Bianco says these Spot ETFs have contributed no significant growth to the Bitcoin market.  Related Reading: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bring In No New Money, Only Recycled Investments In a series of X posts on November 2, Bianco claimed the Spot Bitcoin ETFs despite their impressive inflow record do not attract any new investments to the underlying asset. Firstly, The analyst applauds the performance of these institutional funds some of which rank as the best-performing ETFs of 2024 following their launch in January. However, Bianco highlights BTC has failed to surpass its all-time high value of 73,750 set eight months ago despite the Spot Bitcoin ETFs accruing over $12 billion in inflows since BTC within the same period.  Rather than being less than 4% down from its ATH, the analyst explained that such high inflows should have since pushed premier cryptocurrency beyond the $100,000 mark especially considering other positive indicators such as Fed rate cuts, the halving, and public endorsement by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump.  For context, Bianco references the Gold ETFs with a record of over $6 billion in inflows since March 13, resulting in a 25% increase in gold’s market price during that period. The market analyst postulates that this price growth can be attributed to the “new money” flowing into the Gold ETFs. However, recycled funds shifted from on-chain wallets or centralized exchanges account for the majority of the investments in Spot Bitcoin ETFs.  Jim Bianco backs this theory with a report from Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas which highlighted a decline in the exchange’s bitcoin retail traders over the last few months. Furthermore, he also points to the average Spot BTC ETF trade of $16,000 compared to the average gold ETF trade of  $72,000 which is consistent with investments from wealth managers and institutions. In conclusion, Jim Bianco states the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not attracting any “new money” but merely circulating existing investments in Bitcoin, which he describes as a concerning trend that may grant traditional financial institutions (TradFi) more influence in the crypto market as against the ethos of decentralization.   Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Climb To $0.209 — Here’s The Level To Watch Bloomberg Analyst Fires Back At BTC ETF Criticism Popular Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has issued a strong rebuttal to Bianco’s take on the Spot Bitcoin ETFs which he describes as merely “mental gymnastics”.

At the time of writing, BTC. continues to trade at $68,100 reflecting a 2.55% decline in the past 24 hours.  Featured image from Blockzeit, chart from Tradingview",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Free Web3,2024-11-03 13:58:30+00:00,"Web3 Liberation from Postmodernism’s Stranglehold: The Art Renaissance By VESA Postmodernism isn’t just an art issue—it’s everywhere. This single, pervasive philosophy has seeped into big tech, corporations, legislation, media, and nearly every major institution, often strangling genuine creativity, diversity of thought, and depth. For comparison, there are around 200 other philosophies, 4,300 religions, the male perspective, homemaker moms, the working class, the diminishing middle class, the scientific paradigm, and much more that are left out of gallery circles simply because they don’t fit the dominant narrative, which paradoxically claims to be the one that’s repressed. It’s really a luxury belief for the modern aristocracy—a tool for control—and the Marxist roots always emerge when pressure is applied. Postmodernism’s defining trait is deconstruction, pulling apart concepts and ideals without ever offering a cohesive path forward. It’s a circular maze that keeps doubling back on itself, producing increasingly bizarre conclusions to solve the very problems it creates. Real solutions lie in expanding the field of view beyond this single frame, embracing a diversity of philosophies, religions, and perspectives that have grounded humanity for millennia. The real power of Web3 lies in its ability to do just that: to break art and culture out of this one-note narrative, empowering creators and thinkers alike to explore beyond the limits imposed by postmodernism. This is what we missed in the first run of NFT’s importing the same postmodern experts from the realm we were trying to break free from. That and some better tech solutions for sustainable art, as some of the falling platforms have showed. We first had a true avant-garde scene, which was then quickly eroded by the millions upon millions showered on end-stage postmodern expressions, championed by people who either (a) didn’t realize how tired it all was or (b) were heavily financially and ideologically incentivized to support it. Funny, not funny It turns out that holding contempt for ideas and their significance means that, time and again, the working class ends up being ruled by them. While I understand why this is amusing to some, I see how many are now disillusioned, as the humanities have been overtaken by a single, monolithic ideology. Similarly, the U.S. intelligentsia’s “flyover states” disdain is now facing a reckoning with the MAGA hat in a very different way after 40 years of indulging in postmodern ideas and scorn. The underbelly of the speech in A Bug’s Life is surfacing, too. You can’t only summarise postmodernism to be woke and Marxist, but you aren’t far off. In case you want to hear the foundations, Steven Hicks has a brilliant analysis and summary of it. You might have to spend 3hrs to save your life & community to get it, so it’s not that long, really ⚡️ Part I – Philosophy foundations Part II – Relevance now For five long decades, postmodernism has held art in a chokehold, enforcing its narrow, often cynical, view of reality. Art became a reflection of society’s fragmentation, alienation, and obsession with irony—what I call the “postmodern monolithic rule.” While postmodernism initially sought to challenge established norms, it has since become the new establishment, dictating an increasingly restrictive narrative. The art world under postmodernism has marginalised genuine exploration, profound beauty, and universal human truths. This is where Web3 steps in, not just as a technological shift but as a liberation front for artistic expression. That was the point. Not just monetising what ever, but to actually set culture free. Web3 allows artists to break out from the centralised grip of traditional galleries and critics, unleashing a decentralized platform where new ideas can flourish – however this means the scene has to support that, instead of the next duck tape banana or drooling ape AI pic. Through NFTs and blockchain, creators can finally bypass the gatekeepers, reaching audiences directly and letting their art speak unfiltered. It’s the anti-postmodern era we’ve been waiting for—one that values authenticity, courage, and depth over calculated irony and shallow critique. The freedom to explore and create in as vast a way as the internet has already guided us to be for the past twenty years.   What is the Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch. From paradise to hell, the lesson path is clear in the end stage. These aren’t just imaginative nightmares. They’re warnings about human nature — and what a world without religion is like. Feel familiar a bit? The twet link will explain it further. Outside the restrictive frame of postmodernism lies a rich expanse of artistic traditions and narratives that we’ve been missing out on. Imagine a return to the timeless pursuits of beauty, harmony, and spirituality, merged with the advancements of digital technology. Art that celebrates connection, transcendence, and human potential. Web3 offers the tools to bring these visions to life, and artists are now free to explore themes of mythology, futurism, abstraction, and even divinity—all without needing to conform to a single ideology. This isn’t just art for art’s sake; it’s art for humanity’s sake, and it’s been a long time coming. Authenticity as an Artist: From Cave Paintings to the Metaverse Art isn’t a recent trend—it’s a core aspect of the human journey that dates back to our ancestors painting on cave walls. In today’s world, however, many artists find themselves constrained by expectations to follow specific trends, often losing their authenticity along the way. True artistry isn’t about following popular movements or creating what’s fashionable. It’s about tapping into a lineage of creativity that spans thousands of years, one that includes everything from the first tribal carvings to the masterworks of the Renaissance, all the way to the digital landscapes of the metaverse. Why did Graham Hancock’s Ancient Apocalypse suddenly get attacked as racist, with Hancock himself labeled a white supremacist, despite his thirty-year marriage to a woman of color and his long-standing praise of ancient cultures worldwide throughout his journalistic career? You guessed it—postmodernism, as the series collapses the narrative. I’ll write more on that later. Inside the art world, for the most part, you might hear of Mayan culture and traditions, but not the parts that contradict postmodern ideas. Being an authentic artist means immersing yourself in this vast ocean of history and expression, drawing inspiration from the past and future alike. The beauty of Web3 is that it allows artists to travel across these realms without restriction. The blockchain and NFTs don’t just democratize art; they create a space where we can explore new forms of expression while staying grounded in the wisdom of our creative ancestors. The metaverse, for instance, offers the opportunity to merge the digital with the timeless, creating interactive experiences that honor the depth and spirituality of older art forms while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. When you explore the richness of art history, you find yourself standing on the shoulders of giants. Authentic art doesn’t mimic or simply react—it builds bridges. It’s about discovering your voice in this vast chorus and using every tool available, whether it’s oil on canvas, sculpture, or VR. Web3 and the metaverse make this journey even more exhilarating, providing artists with a canvas as expansive as their imaginations. True artists dig deep, break molds, and remind us that art is not bound by time or technology but by a timeless quest for truth.   Imagine the uproar, the fuss and emotional outbursts if there was to be a grand unveiling of an openly conservative gallery? The Heretical Idea: Curate Your Own Galleries Outside the Establishment Here’s a heretical idea for cultural curators and artists: Forget trying to break into the art world if you don’t feel represented. Start your own galleries, curate your own shows, and let Web3 be your platform for sharing art on your own terms. It’s cheap to start an online gallery. Web3 has made this entirely possible. With decentralized platforms, artists can sidestep traditional gatekeepers, reach global audiences, and create communities that appreciate and support their work. Curating your own gallery isn’t just an act of defiance; it’s a celebration of creative freedom. Imagine artists coming together to form collectives that highlight unique styles, new voices, and daring themes that the conventional art world might consider “too much.” With NFTs and blockchain, you have the tools to bring these exhibitions to life without relying on anyone else’s approval. Curating your own gallery in the Web3 space doesn’t just disrupt the old system; it builds a new one based on collaboration, innovation, and authenticity. This is where real artistic diversity can thrive, unbound by the constraints of a single ideology. Artists can create galleries that reflect their own vision, themes, and messages—whether that’s surrealism, futurism, spiritual exploration, or socio-political commentary. The freedom to shape your own narrative is the most powerful tool artists have, and Web3 is the key to unlocking it. It’s time to stop waiting for permission and start creating spaces that embody the true spirit of art: raw, fearless, and unfiltered. TDR Notice that all these artists and collectors below are doing this poll by not making their views public. I’ve been standing up for this, in the free speech spirit, since I came in from 2017, and was put in the web3 Western culture jail for it (mostly) since. Here is an earlier article to prove it. 7-years ago So, have your postmodernism, it’s fine, I’m not trying to take your voice away from you, but actually deliver on the inclusion promise so everyone can come to play. The virtual is for everyone, not just one dominant ideology that leaves out most of the world. There are so many avenues to explore, but if artists don’t even dare to voice any nuance, let alone take a side in the most polarising election of my lifetime, then something is deeply wrong. As for the cover image, I have my reservations about Trump, even if there’s a potential Web3 landslide against the pro-censorship camp led by figures like Kamala. My concerns are less pronounced with Elon Musk, Ron Paul, RFK, Tulsi Gabbard, and increasingly JD Vance after listening to him on Rogan. While most visual artists sat this one out—even in Web3—the comedians have shifted the landscape, outpacing us 6-0 in terms of relevance. The thing is, even if Trump is guilty of a lot, he and his team of “X-men mutants” have become voices for Bitcoin, free speech, opposition to big pharma, and perhaps even psychedelics, squirrels, and the like. For the first time in my life, a political campaign is actually addressing ideas that interest me. Of course, as I am not a US citizen, you don’t have to worry about my vote even if you absolutely hate everything I just wrote. None the less, this election will greatly influence my life, and it is addressed in the web3 citizen of the world spirit.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Analyst Reveals Buying Opportunities At Lower Prices – Details,2024-11-03 12:00:12+00:00,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at a pivotal level following a 17% retrace from its recent highs around $0.179. This pullback has brought DOGE to a significant demand zone, catching the attention of top analyst Daan, who recently shared a technical analysis identifying this level as an opportunity for accumulation. According to Daan, the current support zone could act as a launchpad if buying pressure intensifies, positioning DOGE for a potential rebound. However, the upcoming days are expected to bring heightened volatility and uncertainty, primarily due to the approaching US election and its anticipated impact on financial markets. As broader market sentiment often influences Dogecoin, this period could present swings in price as traders adjust to both political developments and economic responses. Related Reading: Solana Headed For Correction Before Bounce – Analyst Sets $180 Target The key now is whether Dogecoin can hold above this demand zone. If buyers step in and support builds, a recovery could see DOGE reattempt recent highs or push even further.  Conversely, failing to hold this level might lead to a deeper retrace. Investors are closely watching this area, recognizing that Dogecoin’s next moves will be shaped by internal technicals and external market conditions in the days ahead. Dogecoin At Key Levels  Crypto analyst Daan recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting that Dogecoin is approaching what he sees as prime accumulation levels. With DOGE trading around the $0.151 mark, Daan notes that this price point has acted as a resistance zone for several weeks, making it a key area for potential buying.  In his analysis, Daan points out that the upcoming US election adds a significant layer of uncertainty to the market, dubbing it a “toss-up” for short-term price direction. He explains that the election outcome could impact both traditional and crypto markets, which may lead to temporary downward pressure or a surprising upward movement depending on results and broader market sentiment. Yet, for Dogecoin specifically, he believes that if the price continues to decline to these strategic levels, the risk/reward ratio could be favorable for buyers looking to “take a punt.” Daan also notes that Monday could bring further opportunities if DOGE dips lower, though he advises caution due to the likely volatility in the coming days. The analyst emphasizes that while these are risky conditions, the chance to accumulate DOGE at historically significant levels may pay off if the broader market sentiment aligns favorably post-election. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Indicator Signals Panic Selling At Current Levels – Time To HODL? Ultimately, the coming days for Dogecoin look to be both volatile and uncertain, and whether it holds the $0.151 mark or dips further could set the stage for the coin’s next move. Investors watching DOGE closely are mindful of both the technical setup and external market factors, hoping for a possible rebound in this tumultuous environment. DOGE Technical View Dogecoin is currently trading at a key level of $0.151, where previous supply has now shifted to a crucial demand zone. This level will be essential for bulls looking to regain momentum and push DOGE toward new highs. Holding above $0.151 is vital for establishing a foundation that could propel the price higher, providing the market confidence needed for a potential upward trend. However, if DOGE fails to sustain this level, it could trigger a pullback toward the next major demand zone around $0.135. This lower level has acted as support in the past and could serve as a crucial point for accumulation if selling pressure increases. Related Reading: Analyst Exposes Ethereum Ascending Support At $2,400 – Best Chance To Accumulate ETH? The coming days will reveal whether buyers can defend this $0.151 zone or if a deeper correction is on the horizon. Breaking above current levels would give DOGE the bullish push needed to test higher resistance zones and potentially establish a stronger uptrend. Conversely, losing support here would signal that sellers are still in control, setting DOGE up for a retest of lower demand levels. As volatility remains high, traders are closely monitoring these critical support and resistance points. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

This negative single-day performance ended what was another impressive weekly outing for the crypto investment products. Bitcoin ETFs Shine While Ethereum ETFs Continue To Struggle After a strong performance throughout the month of  October, the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t register a perfect start to November. According to data from SoSoValue, the BTC exchange-traded funds posted a net outflow of $54.9 million on Friday, November 1. Breaking down the data, Fidelity’s FBTC surprisingly accounted for almost half ($25.64 million) of the outflow recorded on Friday. This figure was followed closely by Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB’s $24.13 million, the second consecutive outflow day for the fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Crucial To Sustain Current Buying Pressure – Details Grayscale’s GBTC, which usually contributes to the outflow days for the Bitcoin ETFs, recorded only $5.51 million in capital outflow. Other funds that recorded an outflow on Friday included Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’s HODL, and Valkyrie’s BRRR, with outflows of $5.64 million, $5.86 million, and $1.66 million, respectively. Interestingly, BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund IBIT didn’t see any inflow or outflow on Friday. Prior to this zero-inflow day, the trillion-dollar asset manager’s fund had seen capital influx for the last 14 consecutive days. In fact, IBIT posted its highest inflow day in the past week, with an influx of $872 million on Wednesday, October 30. While the Bitcoin ETFs posted outflows to end the previous week, the negative single-day action barely made an impact on the weekly performance. According to data from SoSoValue, the US BTC funds registered a $2.22 billion cumulative weekly inflow in the past week, the highest value since March. While the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have been producing remarkable performance in recent days, their Ethereum counterparts have not exactly impressed. After witnessing an almost $11 million outflow on Friday, the weekly capital influx was slashed to approximately $13 million for the spot Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin Price Overview Investors will be hoping that the Bitcoin ETFs will resume inflows when trading opens on Monday, considering its recent positive impact on price. The price of BTC almost touched its all-time high of $73,737 on Tuesday and Wednesday when the ETFs recorded their highest inflows in more than five months.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Trump’s Crypto Token Offering: $300 Million Goal With Minimal US Participation – Details,2024-11-03 08:00:08+00:00,"World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) initiative endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has disclosed that its ambitious $300 million crypto token offering is largely aimed at international investors.  To date, fewer than 350 US investors have engaged with the project, raising questions about its domestic appeal amidst a landscape of regulatory scrutiny led by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). World Liberty Financial’s Offshore Focus Operating out of Wilmington, Delaware, yet managed from Puerto Rico, World Liberty recently filed a notice with American regulatory bodies, announcing its intent to sell only $30 million worth of tokens within the United States.  Once this threshold is reached, the crypto venture company plans to halt the US offering, despite having approximately $288.5 million worth of WLF tokens still available for sale. Related Reading: How To Trade Bitcoin During The US Election, Expert Reveals Zachary Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty, indicated in a September interview streamed on X (formerly Twitter), that the company plans to leverage Regulation S—a provision that allows the sale of tokens to non-US investors without requirements typically imposed by US securities laws.  The limited interest from US investors may stem from the SEC’s rigorous approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, which has prompted many token issuers to focus their efforts offshore.  Trump’s involvement, along with that of his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, is highlighted in the company’s filings. However, the document clarifies that their names are included for “informational purposes” and do not imply an official endorsement of the offering. Capital Raising In A Complex Crypto Landscape During the September interview, Folkman discussed the potential for non-US sales through Regulation S, but he refrained from detailing the distribution of tokens between domestic and international buyers.  US investors have been approached through a different regulatory pathway—Regulation D—which allows companies to raise unlimited capital from accredited investors, defined as individuals with a net worth exceeding $1 million, excluding their primary residence. Both Regulation D and Regulation S are designed to streamline capital-raising processes for companies. However, Regulation D imposes stricter investor protections and disclosure requirements.  For instance, companies utilizing Regulation D must publicly disclose details about the offering, including the total amount raised and the number of participating investors. Folkman noted the necessity of verifying that US buyers meet accredited investor criteria, a process that adds another layer of complexity to the offering. As of October 15, World Liberty reported raising $2.7 million under Regulation D by selling tokens to 348 investors. In contrast, analytics from Kaiko show that around 17,000 unique addresses have held the asset at least once, suggesting broader interest that may not be reflected in US sales alone. Related Reading: Worldcoin Rejection At $2.1 Sparks Concerns Of Prolonged Downtrend The divergence between US and offshore sales could be partially attributed to the anonymity afforded by Regulation S, which does not require private companies to disclose capital-raising details or verify the financial status of buyers.  Nevertheless, the regulation mandates that offerings be limited strictly to non-US persons, ensuring compliance with international investment rules. Folkman emphasized the company’s commitment to adhering to regulatory standards during his interview, stating, “We would expect that any potential non-US token sale would be limited to non-US persons and comply with applicable restrictions under what is known as Regulation S.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,solana,Educational Post - Wallet security - Solclaim scam possibilities. - MUST READ FOR ALL,2024-11-03 15:14:49,"Hey everyone,

I want to make an **important post** regarding the recent hype around services like *""solclaim""* and similar offerings.

Today, I received a message from a random user on Telegram. They sent me a referral link to a Telegram bot claiming that you could enter your private keys and get **""free"" Solana**. *Here’s how to think about this:*

>***Imagine giving your house key to someone who can unlock every door in your home. You have no way of locking them out and wouldn’t even know if they were inside your house. Now, imagine the whole neighborhood giving this same person access, just because some received a few dollars in return. Would you really hand over your keys? Sounds crazy, right?***

Let me break down what’s happening here, as many investors **trust too easily** in this space.

**First of all, the Solana you are claiming was yours all along.** Every NFT or token you’ve traded incurs a small rent fee in SOL. You can reclaim this rent, which is typically around 20-40 cents per token. *Reclaiming this rent is easy and convenient*, especially since we don’t hold onto every token we’ve ever traded.

**The problem arises when people trust Telegram bots or shady websites with their private keys.** As someone with experience in developing Telegram bots, I can tell you that these bots are **99.99% likely** to log your private keys in a database.

You might be thinking, *“Who would actually trust this? Who would hand over their private key just to get some free SOL?”* The answer is: **more than 10,000 people**. Aggressive marketing tactics are everywhere. While I won’t outright say they’re stealing private keys and draining wallets, even if they do this to just one large wallet a week, it’s a **huge problem**—and trust me, it’s *incredibly easy* for them to do.

**Once your private key is compromised, it doesn’t matter how long it’s been.** You might forget that you handed it over months ago. Then, after making some big trades and seeing success, you wake up one day to find your funds are gone.

**And here’s the kicker: You can’t prove it was these services.** They have plenty of ways to deflect blame:

* Claim a hacker accessed your phone or PC.
* Suggest you connected your wallet to a malicious site in the past.
* Insist you made the transaction yourself, because on the blockchain, it will look that way.
* Assert that they would never steal your private keys and show off certifications (*it only takes three lines of code to log everything sent to a Telegram bot*).
* Accuse you of being a hater trying to tarnish their reputation.

**TL;DR:**  
*Never, ever share your private keys with anyone.* If you send them out, even once, it’s risky to trust anyone with such sensitive information, especially if you still use those wallets. While these services may not be mass-scamming (*which would be too obvious*), even targeting just a few large wallets is enough to cause significant harm.

There are safe options for reclaiming your SOL rent—**always use wallet connections for this**. Stay vigilant and protect your assets.

Please, be careful, and **never share your private keys. Ever.**

*Have a great rest of your day!*

Reddit,solana,🚀 Wen Bull Run? I Built a One-Stop Dashboard for Degen Market Research,2024-11-02 11:48:26,"Hey anon degens, I got tired of jumping between 69 different sites and pages to check the market vibes, so I built a fun little site called [wenbullrun.com](https://wenbullrun.com/) as a side project – a no-bs dashboard that tells you if we're still eating ramen or if lambos are back on the menu.

Essentially, I've carefully picked some of the most reliable bull run indicators and put them all in one place. Every metric on here serves one purpose: helping you figure out if the bulls are finally back or if we're still hibernating with the bears.

What you get:

* Price action for BTC/ETH/SOL with historical comparisons (7d, 30d, 90d)
* Market dominance tracking (is BTC still king or are the alts gaining ground?)
* Quarterly Crypto VC data showing total deals and investment volume (is it crypto funding winter or summer?)
* Google Trends data (are normies searching ""bitcoin"" again?)
* Coinbase app ranking (tracking retail FOMO in real-time)
* Fear & Greed index with key values and historical averages (because emotions rule over degens)

Everything is automated except the VC investment data (which I update manually because degens need fresh hopium).

No signup required, and no ads, just charts and vibes where you can focus purely on the trend.

📈 Coming Soon:

* M2 Money Supply tracking (money printer go brrr?)
* More suggestions from you degenerates

This is just v1, and I'd love your feedback. What other features or metrics would help you ape more intelligently? What features would make this your go-to dashboard?

Build in public, learn in public. 

Let's make this thing actually useful for everyone.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,solana,Geniuses behind memecoins,2024-10-31 16:03:19,"Hi there!

There is a recurring advice on finding more suitable memecoins to trade: check the team behind the meme! And see if they have had success before, or if they are serial rugpullers. I have had some success with trading lower cap memes, and now I want to slow down and trade memes that last more than a few minutes!

My question is, how to find the team behind the meme, and how to check their credentials (for the lack of a better word!)

Thanks a lot in advance for your help!",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577
Reddit,solana,Stacked BNSOL in Binance Earn,2024-10-31 08:09:04,"Hello,

I stacked some Solana in Binance (without using the Web3 Wallet). As I understand, the stacking rewards are induced by the increasing price of the BNSOL relative to the SOL. But automatically, my BNSOL was sent to the Earn wallet in a flexible simple earn plan with an \~10% APR.

I'm a bit confused as for me, I don't need to put the coin in an earning plan to earn stacking rewards and if the \~10% APR represents the stacking reward, the logic is contrary to what the LST technology wants to offer as it is ""locked"" in a plan (I know it's flexible but still in a plan as I cannot lend it for example).

Can someone enlight me on this topic ? TY",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

I've primarily traded options for the past number of years, but recently have done some fun trading in the Solana ecosystem. 

While memecoins are fun and all, I'm thinking about seriously launching an on-chain decentralized options trading mechanism protocol on Solana. I've already mapped out most of the mechanisms and I've even started carving out the protocol already. 

I just wanted to see what the level of interest of such a protocol is from r/solana?

Initially, I'd probably just start off with Solana options, but eventually they could be expanded to any SPL token. Writers could stake underlying tokens and sell the exercise premium.

Thoughts? Interest levels? Thanks all!",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,ethereum,Market risk of a 51% attack on Polymarket,2024-11-02 22:18:06,"Over the past few days, I did a deep dive into Polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. Here’s what I’ve found:

UMA is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'Trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'Optimistic Oracle'. An 'Asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved ERC20 token) alongside the assertion. Anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'Disputer') may do so, typically by matching the Asserter's stake. If a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'Data Verification Mechanism' (DVM). When it reaches DVM, the tokenholders of UMA decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the Asserter or the Disputer receives the staked currencies). They do this with one vote per UMA token.

Polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with UMA. The API allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. The Polymarket API also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. If there is a dispute, it gets escalated to UMA's DVM system. Disputes rarely happen because the DVM works. Typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. This clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down.

However, the market cap of UMA is only about $200m as of writing this post. A 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. It is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of UMA could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on Polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the DVM for each of them, and win every bet. Doing this would destroy their $100m of UMA, but they'll potentially make more from the bets.

A quick browse of Polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). It's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on Polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. But a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""Presidential Election Winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ):

* Buy ""Yes"" on Chris Christie. $0.001. Buy 72 million shares right now for $72k.
* Buy ""No"" on Trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m
* Buy ""No"" on Kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m
* Accept the loss of $100m worth of UMA due to the price collapsing

**This would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** They could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. There's only about $670m of USDC on the Polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts.

At the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that Chris Christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on UMA.

There is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack UMA, and that would be to gain favor with Trump by using their 51% to decide Trump wins on the betting markets. It could be used to help the publicity battle that Trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election.

I would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on UMA, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). If anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. I'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%.

So, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. If UMA's market cap doesn't rise as fast as Polymarket's betting markets, Polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused.

Reddit,ethereum,I would like to make my final year university project related to Ethereum but I'm struggling to think of ideas,2024-11-02 16:58:29,"Specifically, my supervisor has instructed me that my project has to be related to the theme of cryptoeconomics and ""to analyse and extract information about the strategic behaviour of users and miners to help with the design of more efficient market-regulating mechanisms"". More specifically, it was suggested that I could do a project on PBS but this is a suggestion more than a rule.

That being said, past year's projects have related to credit ratings, fraud detection and someone else this year is doing a project on the correlation of cryptocurrency prices to traditional finance indicies (I was thinking of proposing this but it appeard too simple).

I had proposed the building of a basic MEV bot but I'm not sure if this would be too complex an undertaking over 2 semesters (6 months) and my supervisor didn't have a lot to say as this was an area that he wasn't too familiar with. Furthermore, while the project isn't prohibited and I won't lose marks or anything, there was the idea that the project would be a bit more research oriented and this is more on the developer side. One thing my supervisor mentioned is that novelty isn't a requirement and if I were to proceed with this project, I don't need a crazy original strategy.

I have a few other ideas too: Something to do with climate i.e. comparing emissions of various currencies or investigating the environmental effect of the Ethereum merge.

I hope that makes sense, I'd appreciate any feedback on the feasibility of the above ideas and if you guys had any suggestions of your own.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Okay, this is weird. I just tried to set up a validator on Holesky testnet and noticed I'd have to wait 18 DAYS for activation. Double-checked the queue - there are [32,033 validators ](https://holesky.beaconcha.in)waiting. On a testnet! Something's definitely cooking...

What's even more interesting is that this massive queue started forming right after EIP-7002 (the beacon state root in the EVM proposal) hit the testnet. For those not familiar, this proposal essentially enables smart contracts to verify beacon chain state, which is crucial for many staking innovations.

Looking through some GitHub discussions and Discord channels, I've noticed a lot of activity around:

* DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) implementations
* Restaking protocols
* Liquid staking solutions
* New staking pool mechanisms

I'm particularly intrigued by the DVT testing activities because of the recent Lido simpleDVT and CSM discussions about implementing validator splitting into DVT solutions. Seeing projects like SSV and others actively testing on Holesky makes me wonder if we're closer to seeing production-ready DVT implementations than we think.

Anyone else noticed this unusual testnet activity? What do you think is being tested at such scale?",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,2024-10-31 14:25:40,"# Here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. 

**First a bit of context:**

I guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like MetaMask). So you don’t use crypto the way you’d use Cash App or Revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day.

But the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling YouTube, Instagram, or WhatsApp. So, if we want Ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. Plus most people in Asia and Africa are mobile-first. 

**Why do I even talk about it?**

So we've been building Kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. Our idea has been to stay open and Ethereum-aligned. This means that we haven’t set up “Sign in with Google” or embedded wallets powered by Privy, Capsule, and others. We haven’t even built an Android or Apple app - we have a PWA app so that everyone can use it.

Since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing Ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. But unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work.

I've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from Istanbul to LA and saw people getting onboarded to our app. They used Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask and many other wallets. 

Metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. Rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. Coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing.

And it’s not only Kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like Zora. Some just say: “Ah yeah, it’s normal. I will figure it out once I get in front of my laptop”. Can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances?

Last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753)

And it’s not that the Ethereum community doesn’t care about the UX. Vitalik even said at one of his talks: “We should be as decentralized and open as Linux and Android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as Apple.”

But if Steve Jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from AppStore forever.

Wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. You can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. But this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder.

And the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. But it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. And the whole idea is to have your ENS and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. 

The question is, why does it keep happening? Maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from Firefox, through Chrome up to Opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. But then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time?

If we had solved the Merge, I imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. But it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,ethereum,Best practices for Anonymous Crypto Payment System With User Tracking and Minimal Gas Fee,2024-10-31 08:42:02,"Hello! I'm looking to implement a crypto payment system where users can deposit funds without logging in—ideally through a simple QR code scan or by pasting a wallet address. However, I still need a way to track each user and monitor their total deposits. 
The main requirements are: 
1. Users deposit anonymously without requiring login. 
2. The system needs to associate each deposit with a specific user ID for tracking purposes. 
3. I want to know how much each user has deposited over time. 
4. Ideally, I’d like to minimize gas fees and avoid dust deposits. 

Questions: 
1. Has anyone implemented a similar system or found ways to make anonymous deposits work while tracking users reliably? 
2. When scanning the QR code in MetaMask, the metadata field appears empty. Has anyone encountered this issue, and is there a workaround to pass data reliably with the QR code?
3. Would using smart contracts be feasible in this context? If so, how could I reduce gas fees and avoid creating dust amounts?

I moved $650$ worth of USDC and paid about $4-5 in gas fee for the transaction. No biggie.

I decided to not make the payment after all, and now I want to send back the USDC so I can sell them, but TrustWallet wants over $130 of gas fees. (UPDATE: IT'S OVER 270 NOW.)

How is this possible? Am I doing something wrong? How could the transaction cost about $4 yesterday and over $130 today? 

Btw I checked multiple times during the day and the cost was always insanely high.

I mean I understand gas fees are dependant on congestion of ETH network but $130 for a single transaction?

How can I get my money back to Revolut without losing almost $140 just for sending it back and forth? This is insanity.

On Trust Wallet there are multiple options of selling my USDC directly but I don't know if they are trustworthy(MoonPay or Ramp).

EDIT:
The fee is about $270 now. 😂😂 
Seriously, is Trust Wallet a scam? Am I overlooking something?

Even Swapping my USDC to ETH costs about $270. How could it cost 5$ yesterday, same ETH network, and today 270?

If someone has any idea how to help me get my money back without paying these insane fees, I will send him/her like $20 or so. Thank you.

After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.
* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse.
* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

I made an ETH transfer to my Trezor, but I made a mistake by choosing the BEP-20 (BSC) network, which is not supported by Trezor. The transfer should have been made via the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.

To try to recover the funds, I set up a wallet in MetaMask connected to the BNB Chain. In BscScan, the transaction appears as confirmed, and the balance is correct and at the address.

I then transferred BNB to the same address to cover the transaction fees. I also added the BNB Chain network to MetaMask and imported the Binance-Peg ETH token using the contract

After restarting the application and checking the network, the assets still do not appear in MetaMask.

Reddit,ethereum,Liberation from the taboo on price discussions,2024-10-29 06:07:30,"The Ethereum community still seems to ignore or taboo discussions on price.

Even after the transition to POS, the equation of 'price = security' has been established for Ethereum.

In the debate with Bitcoin maximalists, the Ethereum community, including Vitalik, argued that the burning mechanism is better for increasing value than the fixed issuance amount.

This is also why Justin Drake's 'Ultra Sound Money' meme was born.

I think we need to discuss more seriously how to gradually increase the price of Ethereum. This is not just about making money. The goal is to make Ethereum the network with the strongest security and censorship resistance.

What Bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity. The belief in the immutable issuance rules. In the case of Ethereum, the policy on the total issuance amount seems too vague. I think this is Ethereum's worst selling point.

I thought about several monetary policies.

1. Increase the burn fee when the target total issuance exceeds 100 million, and reduce the burn fee when it falls below, maintaining 100 million.

2. Burn all fees including MEV to create endless deflation. When the total issuance decreases to 50 million, split the coin in half. Then, the number of Ethers will be 50 million -> 100 million -> 50 million -> 100 million repeatedly. People get excited when companies like Tesla and Nvidia do Stocksplit.

3. Set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,ethereum,"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared Vision",2024-10-26 11:41:15,"I’ve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. On the surface, they may seem like separate communities—one focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology—but at their core, they’re both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society.

Both UBI and Ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. They’re about creating a world where we don’t have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we’re looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. It’s about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society.

Money, when you think about it, is political. Every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. In a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper—into the structures that uphold our shared reality.

For those interested in diving further into this vision, here’s a bit of inspiration from popular culture:

- **Arrival** – A film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens.
- **Outlander** – A story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today.
- **Mad Men** – A look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception.
- **Devs** – A glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself.

These themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. Basic Income and Ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future.

Reddit,ethereum,I can't understand L2 networks no matter what,2024-10-21 12:27:28,"So my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular L2 right and if I make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? 


If say bob sends 1 eth to Alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? 


And how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn?


please help, I can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are L2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues.



---




Edit: It finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/DepartedQuantity for helping me out.


So here's my understanding:

Till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the L1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the L1 as a single transaction with some proofs. And some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. 


But the thing is that the L2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. Connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. And all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network    are transactions details(or whatever) in L2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered.


And not L1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

The driving force behind this centralization is XOF (private orderflow), as explained by Toni Wahrstätter on X: [https://x.com/nero\_eth/status/1846786871998759141](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1846786871998759141)

So, where does this private orderflow originate?

For [titanbuilder.xyz](http://titanbuilder.xyz), it partly comes from BananaGunBot (https://x.com/BananaGunBot), as seen in blocks like this one: [https://etherscan.io/block/20959121](https://etherscan.io/block/20959121)

For [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org), it comes from platforms like [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (https://cow.fi/mev-blocker). Their FAQ states they submit to all major builders:

>MEV Blocker submits to all major block builders, including Builder0x69, f1b, Flashbots, rsync builder, Titan Builder, Gambit Labs, and Beaver Build.

But there is a catch: who created MEV Blocker? according to their FAQ:

>MEV Blocker is jointly formulated and maintained by CoW Protocol, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is open to all searchers and block builders.

The last part seems questionable. With control over the order flow, who would rationally share most profitable or important transactions with competitors?

It gets worse: a bot operated by beaverbuild uses the same calldata as the notorious jaredfromsubway MEV bot (https://x.com/MevRefund/status/1835666845547815067), suggesting beaverbuild likely operates the jared bot. jaredfromsubway is known for sandwiching pretty much everything and everyone (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f2f10d1c40777ae1da742455c65828ff36df387).

So, what’s my point? Avoid trading shitcoins, especially with BananaGun. And don’t use [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (rather make sure you have set your slippage tolerance correctly), which appears to be little more than a hypocritical frontend for beaverbuild.

Unfortunately, no one wants to go to private messages, and discord is generally very dull and no one communicates there.

If anyone has any spare time, can you help us out and answer the questions below? Thank you very much in advance!

1. How did you learn about the possibility of making long-term deposits in blockchain? How did you learn about the specific service you use?
2. What was the key factor for your decision to make a long-term deposit on Arbitrum?
3. What was your first long-term deposit on the Arbitrum network and what prompted you to make this choice?
4. What strategy for long-term deposits did you choose (steaking, farming, etc.) and why? What specific applications and services do you use?
5. What process did you find most challenging when creating a long-term deposit through the platforms on Arbitrum?
6. What was your primary goal in Vault steaking/participation/farming (yield, network support, long-term investment, etc.) and how well your experience met expectations

Reddit,ethereum,Lido's Simple DVT Module Surpasses Expectations—A Deeper Look at Distributed Validator Technology's Future in Ethereum Staking,2024-10-18 11:50:36,"I’ve been keeping an eye on the recent developments with Lido’s Simple DVT module, and the numbers are impressive. Just recently, the module hit 2,250 validators and over 72,000 ETH staked, surpassing its initial 0.5% share limit, as noted by u/LidoFinance. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) now powers around 0.75% of the entire Lido protocol. What’s even more interesting is how these DVT clusters are outperforming 8 out of the top 10 staking entities, according to u/ratedw3b.

This got me thinking: What does this mean for the future of Ethereum staking? 🤔

For one, the decentralization of staking is clearly on the rise. DVT allows for a more robust and fault-tolerant staking infrastructure, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure. Projects like SSV Network and Obol Collective are really pushing the envelope here, making Ethereum staking more accessible and secure for both solo and community stakers. It’s awesome to see over 140 new solo and community stakers becoming node operators via DVT—this is a huge step toward decentralization.

But it also raises a bigger question: Could DVT be the key to breaking the dominance of large staking pools and making Ethereum more decentralized at the protocol level? 🤔

SSV Network, in particular, has been at the forefront of this movement. By enabling secure and distributed validator setups, they are changing the game for both small-scale stakers and large operators. I can’t help but wonder how this will impact the wider Ethereum ecosystem, especially as staking becomes more fragmented and democratized.

Would love to hear what you all think—are we on the verge of a decentralization revolution in Ethereum staking, or is it too early to tell? ",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,ethereum,Domain Registrar Based on Smart Contracts,2024-10-17 17:05:22,"# Project Concept

We propose creating a new type of domain registrar that uses smart contracts instead of traditional accounts to determine domain management rights.

# How It Works

1. When transferring a domain to this registrar, functions in the smart contract are called to add the new domain.
2. The address of the smart contract that has the rights to sign changes related to this domain is specified.

# Advantages

1. **Decentralized Management:** Domains do not depend on an individual's email.
2. **Flexible Management:** Ability to use multi-signature or DAO voting for decisions on DNS record changes.
3. **Security:** Use of cryptographic protection methods instead of passwords.
4. **Transparency:** All changes are recorded on the blockchain.

# Technical Implementation

1. **Integration with Existing DNS:** The service functions as a regular centralized registrar, fully compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure.
2. **Support for Popular Domains:** Ability to transfer and manage top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.).
3. **Auto-Renewal:** The system automatically renews domain registration by deducting funds from the smart contract.
4. **Open Balance Top-Up:** Any user can top up the contract balance for a specific domain without the need for authorization.

# Potential Applications

* For DAO projects
* For collaborative business projects
* For personal use (using a wallet instead of email for ownership confirmation)

# Questions for the Community

1. If such a project were implemented and announced by one of the top 10 existing domain registrars, would you use it for your new project?
2. Would you consider using this service for your personal domains?
3. What additional features would you like to see in such a service?
4. How do you assess the potential of this technology for managing digital assets in the future?",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Why Is Europe So Far behind in Bitcoin Adoption Compared to America and Even Parts of Asia? ,2024-11-03 06:54:17,"I am not saying BTC went mainstream anywhere except El Salvador, but at least in America and some select Asian cities (Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong) you can hear people putting money in it, at least as a speculative asset if nothing else. So many even dare to short it, which is okay, as it gives the market some liquidity and activity. 

You can also find merchants, boutique hotels, cafes accepting bitcoin, some bitcoin ATMs, and exchanges offering bitcoin backed cards etc. 

But in Europe, half the people seem barely aware of the concept of bitcoin, even the word is totally new to so many. 

Why this? Does it indicate ignorance? Or does it indicate Europeans enjoy so much trust in their financial instiutions, central bank and economy that they look down on anyone buying bitcoin?

Following and keeping up with highly influential people with a large following will help you see some things coming, and that’s why I withdrew two weeks before the fall.

As I invested at the start of my journey in crypto with the mindset that I’d never see this money again, I also risked a small amount in Celsius. You never truly know for a fact what will happen, so never risk it all.

Been following it since.

Really threw myself down the rabbit hole, enough to debunk critiques or outright incorrect statements.

All through 2022 and 2023 mainstream media was dancing on bitcoin's ""grave""

Making ridiculous statements

""Bitcoiners are psychopaths""

""Bitcoin is only used for criminal activity""

""Bitcoin is harmful to the environment and a drain on our power infrastructure""

If I had not done my own research, I would have probably just accepted what the talking heads on TV say.

I wholeheartedly believe the media intentionally lied about bitcoin.

Maybe so Blackrock could scoop it up in their ETF.

Where's the skeptics now? Where's the experts scolding bitcoiners? Where's the man in the expensive suit telling me I'm wrong and stupid?

I have absolutely ZERO trust in the media.

Fuck these people.

They knowingly lied to your face about inflation.

What else do they lie about?

What else do they exaggerate or gaslight to the public.

American citizens lost 25% of their purchasing power over these four years.

""Teehee oh I guess since Larry Fink endorses it now you dumbasses can have our seal of approval""

If people understood what the media did, we would have guillotines outside CNN, CBS, MSNBC.

25% gone.

Bitcoin puts value on the net. Imagine a sibling network, to put goods and services on the net in like manner. 



A P2P, open source, decentralised market where anyone could theoretically trade anything with anyone anywhere under free market conditions and have it delivered. Requiring only a phone and some btc. So take all Bitcoins features and skill set and apply it to putting goods on the net. 



To draw an image in your head. Ignoring the block size wars. Imagine a bitcoin transaction carrying a little more information (Location, value and basic description of a product) was sent to a dedicated market address. This address would be visible to anyone anywhere in the same way btc's utxo's are - effectively acting as a global shop front.

It was my 6th trade in Robosats, and I took an existing order to sell sats for 900€.

The buyer didn't show up for hours, and then he apologized, made a made up excuse and said he had just ordered the instant SEPA transfer, but now, after all the night has passed, I have not received the funds. I opened a dispute, and the Lightning payment went throught!!! 900€ lost, I am tryimg to contact the Order host, but I feel I can't do much and I have been scammed :(

Last time using Robostas if this does not end well...

Just want to let you know in order to take extra care if you use Robosats.

Any help/advice?

HAPPY ENDING:

After the buyer letting pass hours to complete the first step of the trade, then again more hours to complete the second one, then again more hours to answer my messages, finally the bank wire is in my account.

The Big Lake (Robosats coordinator) responded very kindly to my message and when I was building the case for my defense, I show the bank wire and I sent several screenshots (including the 900€ wire) to prove him I was telling the truth.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Well, using [](https://twitter.com/bitcoinhornet) ‘s BTC FIRE calculator the worst case scenario (Photo 1) you‘d eventually end up with a perpetual 1.5 BTC / $5M total capital minimum never really running below that level for life and at the recommend neutral power-law band scenario (Photo 2) you’d eventually end up with minimum 3.7 BTC / $18M total capital which, of course continues to increase in value.

6.25 BTC costs about the same as the average American home sale price right now.

Also for reference, MicroStrategy’s bear case for 2045 is $3M, base case $13M, and bull case is $45M. Photo 1 says $4M and Photo 2 says $10M. So i’d say both of these hypothetical scenarios run between MicroStrategy’s bear and base case e.g. conservative. ",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

*Reason 1: Past Experience*

1. You previously invested in Bitcoin, sold too early, or tried leverage trading and lost money. Your feelings are hurt, making you want Bitcoin to fail because you missed the boat. Your ego is holding you back. Consider a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

*Reason 2: Lack of Understanding*

1. You're unfamiliar with Bitcoin or haven't done sufficient research. Watching YouTube videos is a good starting point, but explore educational books and articles too. Bitcoin is complex; studying it takes time.

*A Lifelong Learning Journey*

Bitcoin is a rabbit hole. Despite years of study, I'm still learning. This technology is relatively new and challenging to grasp. Your first Bitcoin investment should be education.

Remember, losing money is an opportunity to learn, a ""cost of tuition"" in understanding the space. ",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

I ended up contacting Blockchain.info as the only info it had was a login link that no longer works. Blockchain info told me there is no way to recover it without my recovery seed. 

I forgot about it and a while ago Gmail sent me a notification that an email was going to be closed because I hadn’t logged into it for a few years. Turns out I had use that email in 2014 to set up a Blockchain.info wallet and nothing else. 

I again reached out to blockchain to make sure there was no way to recover it and again was told without my recovery seed there was nothing to be done. 

I didn’t give up this time and found a Reddit thread from a few years ago that had the info I needed. 

The email will have a URL similair to below 

https://blockchain.info/wallet/1b729495-43e2-41c8-9cdc-00000000f

Everything after wallet/ is your username. You just need to guess/remember the password and login here

https://login.blockchain.com/beta/auth/login?product=wallet

But it gets worse!

That link above will save you a lot of time because on the main login page If you guess the wrong password it just says invalid login. However when you get the right password it will tell you to it’s invalid but “you should try our legacy site here”

Finally logging in on the legacy site(which I linked above) will work

Fuck you blockchain.info for not just having bad customer service but customer service so bad it will literally cost people money. 

My 0.01 Bitcoin is safely back in a utxo I control the key to. 

EDIT: After looking into it further, there no longer appears to be a legacy site and login on the main wallet page works as expected. Support will still tell you “ it is not possible to login with your recovery seed” which is false. You can login to any wallet ever created with blockchain.info, their support is just doesn’t know how to do their job which is a reflection on management. ",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Also a lot of the companies I own pay dividends which is nice and comforting. 

With Bitcoin I don’t get any of that and therefore it makes it very hard for me to hold on to. Even though I feel like I ‘understand it’ and can see its value it’s hard for me to get a true conviction.

This has led me to become a terrible market timer instead of a long term holder.

I bought Bitcoin for the first time in 2017 when it was around $4500 and later selling at $12.000. Bought in again at $18.000 in 2020/21 and sold after the crash at $40.000. And last time I bought in again at the beginning of 2024 around $35.000.

This might not look too bad but the problem is that I did not increase the invested amount a whole lot with each new purchase. So in 2017 I had a whole coin but right now it’s only a fraction of that. 

Anyway that’s enough rambling. I hope this post can be a turning point for me and I will do my best to just hold on from here on :)

Reddit,bitcoin,"10,000 Plebs Can Change The World",2024-11-02 01:23:05,"With institutions and nation-states getting involved in Bitcoin, it can feel like the humble pleb is no longer relevant. But I'm here to tell you that **dedicated plebs can change the world**. Let's imagine a ""doomsday"" scenario: every single current holder begins to sell bitcoin in order to suppress the price, while a rag-tag group of 10,000 plebs each buys 10 USD of BTC per day. If we run this through a simulation, we get the chart below. The orange line is the amount of BTC held by sellers, and the black line is the theoretical price of bitcoin at which the plebs' buy pressure would match the sell pressure from sellers and the block subsidy. As we can see, the sellers can keep a lid on the clearing price by continuously selling (note: each large jump upwards coincides with a halving, since the sell pressure from the block subsidy gets cut in half):

And it's possible that the sellers can keep this up for a long time! Below is the same simulation extended until just before the sellers run out of BTC. As we can see, the sellers successfully keep a lid on prices the whole time:

But once those sellers run out of BTC, then the plebs are buying straight from the tiny amount of BTC available for sale from the block subsidy, and the theoretical clearing price soars instantaneously:

They normally start with baby for something like corals and slowly transition to the highest evolutionary progression which is bitcoin

2. Change the fiat cash illustration to monkey, from coins to cash was the true regression to monkey
3. Bonus, maybe replace bitcoin illustration to giga chad figure

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Monthly Optimists Discussion - November 2024,2024-11-01 09:04:07,"Welcome to the Monthly Optimists Discussion thread. As the title implies, the purpose of this thread is to promote discussion which is guardedly optimistic about cryptocurrency topics. This thread is intended to be a counterweight to the Skeptics Discussion thread and will be pinned when the markets are bearish.

Please read the rules and guidelines before participating.

&nbsp;

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence. For example, announcing an obscure online store is adopting coin X for payments and then speculate Amazon will adopt it next without evidence. Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator. Please report shilling or any comments which violate the rules.

Usually I used to use Kraken. But today they seriously took my money hostage in silence, not even a notification. Its horrendous.

What happened?
Well I deposited money to my kraken account via SEPA Instant Transfer..my usual experience with this was that I execute the order and 5-15 minutes later it was credited on my kraken account.

Not this time though. Noooo.
After 2 hours I got worried and contacted the support. Little did I know apparently all of a sudden after 7 years being a customer my proof of funds wasn't sufficient anymore and kraken just took my funds hostage - in silence - no warning, no notification not even a mail that told me I have to provide updated documentation. Nada!

Now. I did provide a current payslip.now. And now it's stuck in verification alongside my money and everything that is still in open positions.

Get rekt kraken.
I seriously hope my funds get credited asap and I don't have to sue to get my shit back.

Anyhow, back to my main question: which exchange do you use and trust? Is kraken still ""the best"" despite their unbelievable downgrade in user-friendlyness and increase in scummy scam feeling?

Enlighten me - please.

I don't want anyone including myself to experience shit like this ever again in the future.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Best Platform?,2024-11-03 17:17:57,"Hey everyone! I’ve been on a journey learning about cryptocurrency and trading for about a year now, and I’m looking to level up my skills. When I first started, I used the Coinbase app for trading because it was pretty straightforward for a beginner. Recently, though, I switched over to Kraken, opting for their free version to see what it’s all about. I have to say, though, Kraken’s free version leaves me wanting more—especially when it comes to features for analyzing data. It feels pretty limited in terms of data manipulation, which is something I’d like to dive deeper into.

Another thing I noticed with Kraken is that it doesn’t provide any news updates or community interactions directly within the app. I think having access to a news feed or a way to connect with other traders in real-time would be really valuable. Staying updated on market news and trends is crucial, especially in the crypto world where things can change rapidly. I’d prefer to have everything in one place rather than having to use multiple platforms to stay informed and engage with the community.

So, I’m curious—what platforms are you all using to trade crypto? I’d love to hear what’s working well for you and why you prefer your chosen platform. I’m especially interested in hearing about any platforms that offer strong analytics tools, reliable news sources, or even built-in community features.

Today, I actually decided to pull all my money out of crypto. After experiencing some pretty significant losses over the past few days, I figured it might be best to step back and reevaluate my approach. When I re-enter the market, I’d really like to make sure I’m doing so with a solid platform that supports my goals and provides the tools I need to make informed decisions.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations! Looking forward to hearing what works for you all and maybe discovering a new go-to trading app in the process.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What is required for crypto to be the future?,2024-11-02 01:11:58,"This is a rant!

I've recently discovered crypto in a more deep sense. I absolutely love the idea of decentralized finances and trustless systems. The technology of block-chains is fascinating. However I have one issue, if we want to use crypto like we do cash, (buy coffee, a house, new shoes, etc.) what is needed to make that happen?

Crypto is extremely volatile right now. So it doesn't make sense to me to pay for things with (lets say Litecoin) when the Litecoin could be worth 70 USD one day and 35 next month. (I understand that the perfect scenario is everyone uses crypto derived from limited supply currencies like bitcoin, and thus we have a decentralized, low fee, hard money system.) But let's be realistic, crypto will not replace fiat money in our lifetimes. So if the (ex. US) is still based on the USD, and inflation continues to occur, how does crypto help us fight that? You would essentially need your L1 currency of limited supply to increase in price equal to that of inflation, otherwise your currency has just succumb to inflation. So how do we deal with this?

Ideally, in a world of fiat and crypto, I should be able to hold an appreciating base currency that grows equal to or greater than inflation of fiat money, and then swap some of the base to a stable coin whenever I need to make a purchase or just convert it to fiat money.

So how do we get to a point where the L1 currencies are appreciating at a rate greater than or equal to inflation in an given moment. If I buy into bitcoin and convert 70k USD to 1 BTC, and I want to buy something that costs 70k USD (1 BTC), but then BTC is worth 65K the next week, I can no longer buy that 70k USD item. If I were to put 70k USD into a stable coin worth at 1:1, I would succumb to inflation as I directly need as many stable coins as dollars. But if I use a coin that is some set ratio of an L1 coin then we have a hard money system. But that hard money system is still attached to fiat inflation and other movements.

So how do we preserve value in crypto while connecting fiat movements while preserving peoples purchasing power.

I don't know I feel like I've been thinking in loops. I think I understand crypto and I do understand the US federal reserve and the gold standard, I'm just having a lot of difficulty connecting the two and making it make sense. I'm liking missing something.

Like if I buy into bitcoin at 70k and wanna buy a house for 700k or 10 BTC but then BTC went down, well fuck I guess I just lost my purchasing power. But then oh wait I can now afford a 1.7 million dollar house with my 10 BTC? How is that a good store of value?",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Form 1099-DA Explained: How New Reporting Requirements Will Impact Crypto Investors (USA),2024-11-01 15:13:53,"*The IRS Form 1099-DA is planned to take effect January 1, 2025 and will be required for all digital asset brokers.*

# Introduction

The IRS has drafted the first ever tax form specific to crypto and digital assets. This form, Form 1099-DA, will fundamentally change how cryptos are reported to the IRS and individuals, shifting much of the reporting responsibility off of the taxpayer and onto ""brokers"". More on that later.

# Background

In April 2024, the IRS released the first draft of Form 1099-DA with requirements for custodial brokers being released in July 2024 and a revised draft of Form 1099-DA in August 2024. This form and associated reporting requirements will bring more transparency and reporting to the crypto space than ever before. For the first time, crypto transactions will more or less be treated similar to traditional assets like stock and securities when it comes to brokers being required to report transaction activity to both the taxpayer as well as the IRS. Effective for the 2025 tax year, the IRS will be receiving an immense amount of data regarding taxpayer's crypto activity.

# Key Points

1. **This form aims to standardize reporting requirements over digital assets, requiring all ""brokers"" to submit a 1099-DA to the IRS and taxpayer**. The IRS defines a broker as an entity that “regularly provides services effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person”. This includes exchanges, digital asset wallet providers that facilitate trades/transfers, and can even potentially include crypto ATMs. This, of course, raises a lot of questions for wallet providers and crypto ATMs that are not KYC. It is very possible that those brokers who do not collect the adequate information from the taxpayer to complete the 1099-DA will be out of compliance and could face legal action if they continue to serve US taxpayers.
   1. There has been some confusion around whether or not noncustodial wallets will be classified as brokers for purposes of these reporting requirements. [In the final requirements Rule published by the IRS in July 2024](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/09/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for#:~:text=Proposed%20§%E2%80%891.6045%2D1(a)), the IRS specifies that a facilitative service includes any service that ""directly or indirectly effectuates a sale of digital assets, such as providing a party in the sale with access to an automatically executing contract or protocol, providing access to digital asset trading platforms, providing an automated market maker system, providing order matching services, providing market making functions, providing services to discover the most competitive buy and sell prices, or providing escrow or escrow-like services to ensure both parties to an exchange act in accordance with their obligations"". While this language suggests it is very likely certain unhosted wallets *could* be subject to the 1099-DA reporting requirements, it is also important to note that ""unhosted wallet providers"" has removed from the explicit definition of ""broker"". This continues to be a grey area and we are eagerly awaiting more clarity from the IRS.
2. **The 1099-DA will provide proceeds, cost basis, and gain/loss details for each transaction** facilitated on the platform, as well as additional details. More on cost basis later.
3. **There is a new section for ""wash sales""**. The instructions read: ""Shows the amount of nondeductible loss in a wash sale transaction involving digital assets *that are also stock or securities for tax purposes*."" This is particularly confusing as we know [the IRS currently defines crypto as property](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets#:~:text=For%20U.S.%20tax%20purposes%2C%20digital,%2C%20owned%2C%20transferred%20or%20traded). This likely means that, as expected, new guidance and regulation will be coming out explicitly disallowing wash sales for crypto. As mentioned in a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ge6i3r/what_to_know_about_the_wash_sale_loophole_tax/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), the wash sale loophole is still currently open for crypto in 2024, but is expected to be closed as early as 2025. This wording in the 1099-DA further solidifies these expectations. 
4. **""Noncovered Assets"" will be specifically identified and documented.** Noncovered assets are assets that the broker did not provide custodial services for or assets that were transferred into the platform and/or were acquired prior to 2026. If the box is checked indicating it's a non covered asset, certain fields in the form may be blank INCLUDING THE COST BASIS FIELD. This is extremely important to understand as the proceeds may appear as 100% capital gains unless you provide the accurate cost basis on the asset. This will result in taxpayers paying substantially more tax than they might actually owe. Taxpayers should not rely on 1099-DAs with missing cost basis data for tax owed.
5. **Brokers must attest to relying on customer-provided data.** There is a section where the broker will indicate if they have relied on customer provided data, such as cost basis. The ability to submit data such as cost basis will vary on a broker by broker basis. For example, Coinbase may create a feature to input your own cost basis on assets transferred into the exchange which will then be included on the 1099-DA. If that is the case, this box will be checked.
6. **Both stablecoins** **and NFT transactions are allowed to be aggregated (separately)**, as long as total proceeds is less than $10,000 annually. All other digital asset transactions will have to be reported separately.

# Implications For Taxpayers

Taxpayers can expect to receive 1099-DAs from various different exchanges and wallet providers. The forms received will also be reported directly to the IRS. However, for assets purchased prior to 2025 as well as all assets transferred into a qualifying exchange/wallet provider, cost basis data will not be accurate and will be left blank on the form. As a result, it is imperative that taxpayers maintain accurate cost basis records on their own and continue to report their transaction using Form 8949 (these 1099-DA forms do not replace the requirement to report using Form 8949 and Schedule D). 

# Comments

While the 1099-DA is going to help streamline data requirements, there are still many issues this will not solve. For one, there are various cost basis accounting methods available to taxpayers. The 1099-DA will default to First-In-First-Out (FIFO). However, a taxpayer may elect to utilize Specific Identification (assuming they meet the data requirements), allowing them to elect more favorable methods such as Highest-In-First-Out (HIFO), which may result in differences in what is being reported on the Form 1099-DA vs what the taxpayer is reporting on their 8949. While the 1099-DA will help bring a lot more transparency to crypto trading, it will not necessarily result in fully accurate tax reporting for taxpayers. 

Additionally, it is very important that taxpayers do not solely rely on the 1099-DAs, especially if transferring assets between wallets and exchanges. As mentioned, if an exchange receives an asset from an outside source, it will assign a blank/$0 cost basis to the asset on the 1099-DA. If this was provided to a traditional CPA or filed into turbotax, this would wrongfully result in 100% capital gain. Instead, the taxpayer should identify the cost basis on the assets transferred in and ensure they are correctly reporting it on their 8949. By maintaining accurate records for all crypto activity, taxpayers can ensure they have the proper paper trail to back up their numbers as well as ensure they are optimizing and minimizing tax due while remaining compliant. 

# TLDR

Starting January 1, 2025, brokers dealing with digital assets, including exchanges and certain wallet providers, must collect and report taxpayer transaction data to the IRS via Form 1099-DA. This form will detail proceeds, cost basis, and gain/loss, though gaps in cost basis (for non-covered assets) can impact tax liability. Taxpayers should keep independent records, especially for assets transferred between wallets,  to ensure accurate tax reporting.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Is the next bull run going to lead to even more successes than Crypto has generated?

&nbsp;

###Rules:

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r\/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules/) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on-topic, ie only related to critical discussion about cryptocurrency. For example, the flaws in a consensus algorithm, how legitimate a project is, missed development milestones, etc.  Discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 
 
 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

Most of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"MicroStrategy's $9.91 billion investment is now worth $18,330,383,597, by only holding and not giving into FUD",2024-10-30 21:36:55,"MicroStrategy currently holds approximately  252,000 Bitcoin.


Their average purchase price being $39,200, their investment of $9.91 billion is currently worth $18,330,383,597, as of October 31 2024, Bitcoin being worth $73,000.


We've seen people say it was a bad investment, that MicroStrategy was going to fail, and million other things, while they never cared and kept buying. They've doubled their money into $18 billion by purely DCAing and holding.


And we have no idea how high Bitcoin will keep going, as it's just getting started, and their profits might become even more.


Both MicroStrategy and El Salvador have made crazy amount of gains while both were criticised for their decision initially.


And the first few days of October had everyone thinking we won't get anywhere near the ATH, but it seems the market doesn't really care about TAs and what we think. Michael Saylors personal opinion was that Bitcoin could reach $13M each by 2030, so we'll see how that goes. ",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,crypto,Going from KEM to Signatures,2024-10-13 12:46:29,"Is there a known efficient way to generically convert a secure KEM into a signature scheme? I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme.  
I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

So in my app the user's password will be used for both account authentication and file encryption key. Below is the schematics of my process

user authentication:  
password + salt -> bcrypt -> stored password hash & salt value in db

when user login, will use bcrypt on the plaintext password and the stored salt value to make sure the hash match with the one in database.

file encryption:  
generate pbkdf2 derived password from main password + salt value (the same one in db) -> this derived key then be used for aes file encryption / decryption key

For the sake of simplicity, I am using the same salt value in the database for both authentication and pdkdf2 aes key generation, I think it's safe, just wanted a second opinion. Thanks",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-11-04 00:53:56.933577

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times
