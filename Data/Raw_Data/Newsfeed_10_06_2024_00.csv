Many are eagerly anticipating Chainlink to surge during this cycle and finally reclaim new all-time highs. The extended consolidation phase has kept traders on edge, as they await a significant breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers Renowned crypto analyst Lucky has shared an insightful prediction regarding Chainlink’s potential trajectory. According to Lucky, the key lies in LINK breaking above its current consolidation range, which would set the stage for a strong upward move. He suggests that once this breakout occurs, Chainlink could quickly surge toward a short-term target of $15. With bullish sentiment building around this major resistance level, Chainlink’s price action in the coming days could be crucial in determining its direction. Investors are closely monitoring the market, watching for signals that LINK is ready to break free from its long-standing range and enter a new phase of growth. Chainlink Price Action Turning Bullish Chainlink’s price action has been largely bearish since hitting its yearly high in March, with the asset now stuck in a prolonged consolidation phase. However, many analysts believe this consolidation could be nearing its end. One top analyst, Lucky, has recently shared a bullish technical analysis on X, offering an optimistic outlook for Chainlink. Lucky’s analysis reveals that LINK is trading within a falling wedge pattern, a formation often associated with potential bullish reversals. According to his chart, Chainlink has touched the lower boundary of this wedge three times, signaling strong support, and now appears to be gearing up for a breakout from its yearly consolidation range. He predicts that this breakout could happen as early as October, potentially triggering a surge in LINK’s price. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Lucky has set several bullish price targets once Chainlink breaks out of this consolidation phase. The first target is $15, followed by more ambitious targets at $19 and $22. These price levels would represent significant gains from Chainlink’s current price and mark a strong recovery from the bearish trend that has dominated most of 2024. With bullish patterns emerging, investors are closely watching for Chainlink’s next move, anticipating that a major breakout could propel LINK toward these optimistic price targets. Technical Analysis: Key Prices To Watch Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $11.09 and is testing a key resistance level, the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $11.10, after a 7% surge since Thursday. This level has become a significant hurdle for bulls, as the price has struggled to break above the indicator. For the bullish momentum to continue, LINK must push past this indicator and aim for higher supply zones around $13. However, the current price action suggests that bulls are finding it difficult to gain strength at this critical level. Should LINK fail to break above $11.10 and reclaim the higher resistance, a correction may follow. In that scenario, the price could dip to a lower demand zone, with the next key support level at $9.2. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The coming days will likely determine whether LINK can maintain its upward trajectory or see a pullback in price.

This has occurred simultaneously with a nearly 7% increase in the value of the meme coin. Market observers are investigating what this may potentially mean for the future of SHIB, especially in light of the increased confidence in the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Down 20% As Market Retracement Forces Sell-Off Over 6 Million SHIB Incinerated The Shiba Inu community’s increasing dedication to lower the token supply reflects in the latest burn rate. Shibburn statistics show that during just the past 24 hours, almost 6.54 million SHIB tokens were burned. Usually, this kind of supply-chain cut indicates a positive trend. Such supply cuts sometimes point to a bullish trend. The people in the SHIB community seem to rally for this cause, hoping to juice up the price of the token. It is a good moment to buy altcoins now before the next big rise, according to analyst Alan Santana, who recently pointed out that the market is approaching its final accumulation for 2024. #Altcoins ✴️ Shiba Inu Long-Term Bull-Market Accumulation Zone To Become Active As we get closer and closer to 2025, the Altcoins market is preparing to enter the last accumulation phase of 2024.

Investors are feeling optimistic as a result of this level of activity. From the initial supply, 410.73 trillion SHIB tokens have so far been destroyed. The amount of tokens in circulation, at 583.51 trillion, is still substantial. The SHIB community is still upbeat that the meme coin will exceed expectations and perform well in the upcoming weeks, or months. Santana’s assessment indicates that the present weak market, particularly the growing turmoil in the Middle East, may cause some disruptions. However, investors shouldn’t worry too much as cryptocurrencies can sometimes bring big surprises. Many people are keeping a close watch on this since the Shiba Inu community is working together to limit the supply. Does the price appreciation for SHIB have anything to do with the current rush to burn? Investors hold their breath and hope for a breakout as the year 2025 approaches.

This crypto market downturn has been attributed to multiple factors including heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and rising liquidations of long positions.  While Ethereum has experienced some rebound in the last day gaining by 3.21%, investors remain uncertain of a full price recovery with bearish sentiments raving through the market. Notably, an Ethereum ICO participant has now sold off a substantial amount of ETH intensifying concerns of a prolonged downward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk Of Further Decline: Top Investor Sets $2,150 Target If Support Breaks Ethereum ICO Wallet Continues Selling Spree, Offloads 40,000 ETH In Two Weeks According to data from blockchain analytics firm, Lookonchain, an Ethereum wallet with the address “0xBF4” moved 6,000 ETH worth $14.11 million to the Kraken exchange on Friday. So far, the address has been identified as an early Ethereum investor who acquired 150,000 ETH valued at $368 million in the asset’s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. Data from Lookonchain highlights this is the second ETH sale by “0xBF4” in the last week after the ICO participant initially sold 19,000 ETH, valued at $47.54 million over Wednesday and Thursday. Notably, this ETH whale has transferred out 40,000 ETH worth $101 million since September 22, holding a balance of 99,500 ETH valued at $238 million. Generally, massive token offloads by large holders e.g. whales are interpreted as bearish signals as they indicate a lack of confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. Sales such as those seen from “0xBF4” may trigger a panic selling from smaller investors inducing a stronger downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? 108,000 ETH Moved To Exchanges In 24 Hours Aside from the wallet address “0xBF4”, other investors have recently sold off large amounts of ETH. According to analyst Ali Martinez, 108,000 ETH valued at $259.2 million have been transferred to exchanges in the last day. This massive sale activity indicates a heightened sentiment in the ETH market.  Currently, Ethereum trades at $2,399 following its recent price rally. However, its daily trading volume has declined by 17.48% and is valued at $14.61 billion. If bearish sentiments persist, ETH could retrace to around $2,200 at which lies its next significant price level. However, amidst massive selling pressure, the altcoin could trade as low as $1,600. With a market cap of $291.40 billion, Ethereum continues to rank as the second largest cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of 13.47%.

This bearish pressure is believed to have been triggered by the escalating tension in the Middle East after Iran fired missiles into Israel. However, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be making a turnaround to close the week, bouncing back above $62,000 on Friday. The latest on-chain observation shows that this latest recovery seen with the Bitcoin price is connected to dwindling selling pressure. 4,000 Long Positions Liquidated On October 1 —  What Next? In a new Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Caueconomy discussed the impact of the recent liquidations of long positions in the Bitcoin futures market. According to the analyst, the ongoing liquidations have reduced the bearish pressure on the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million Payout After Selling HIPPO On Sui Network Early For context, futures allow investors to speculate on the price of a specific asset (Bitcoin, in this scenario). A long position is taken when a BTC trader buys a futures contract, predicting the coin’s price to rise at a later date. The trader incurs a loss when the asset’s price falls below the purchase price specified in the futures contract. According to data from CryptoQuant, more than 4,000 long positions were liquidated following the latest price decline on Tuesday, October 1, representing the second-largest liquidation event so far this year. Although liquidations reflect significant selling activity and investor losses, they can also signal pivotal shifts in market sentiment. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that periods of severe losses and market liquidations often lead to the formation of local price bottoms. “During significant price declines, the number of contracts purchased tends to drop sharply due to liquidations, which reduces selling pressure in the market,” Caueconomy said. Furthermore, the analyst mentioned that the price of Bitcoin might be gearing up for a short-term recovery due to the reduced selling pressure. However, Caueconomy highlighted the importance of increasing buying strength from the investors for the Bitcoin price to make a full comeback. Bitcoin Price At A Glance It does appear like the price of Bitcoin established a local bottom around the psychological $60,000 level before a pivotal rebound. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency trades around the $62,000 mark, reflecting an over 2.5% increase in the past day. Related Reading: FET At Risk Of Further Decline?

These whales likely believe that the bull is far from over, which is why they haven’t secured as much profit as they have done in previous bull runs.  Bitcoin Whales Have Taken Lesser Profits In This Market Cycle Than Past Ones Ki Young Ju mentioned in an X post that if the Bitcoin bull cycle were to end here, it would mean that Bitcoin whales have just set the record for the least profit-taking across all cycles ever. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez tried to counter Ki Young Ju’s point by highlighting how these whales have been distributing their BTC across different addresses, leading to a drop in the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.  Related Reading: ‘FLOKI Master Plan’: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2,000% Jump For The Shiba Inu Competitor However, the CryptoQuant founder claimed that this is still the lowest return rate across all cycles, no matter how much these whales sold through those different wallets. He also revealed that the whales that are selling now are doing so with little profit, suggesting that they are likely new whales with weak hands.  Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju noted that the type of transactions that Martinez alluded to cannot always be considered as sales. He remarked that one must look at more macro-level aggregated data, such as historical realized profit, rather than just transactions to get the bigger picture.  These whales are believed to be holding back on taking profits just yet, considering that the bull run looks to be far from over. The CryptoQuant CEO also mentioned earlier that Bitcoin was still in the middle of a bull run based on the market cap to realized cap metric.  Instead of taking profits, these Bitcoin whales are still accumulating more BTC ahead of the next leg of the bull run. CryptoQuant recently revealed that there has been a surge in the outflows from exchanges, the largest since November 2022. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju also noted that new whales are accumulating at a rate the market has never witnessed before.  When Is This Market Cycle Expected To Peak? Crypto analysts like Rekt Capital have predicted that the Bitcoin market top could occur sometime in mid-September or mid-October 2025. However, in a recent report, CoinMarketCap offered a different opinion, predicting that the cycle top could potentially be between mid-May and mid-June 2025.  Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash The platform noted that Bitcoin is currently ahead of historical trends, especially considering that it hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving event.

The flagship cryptocurrency has spent most of the last two quarters in consolidation, fluctuating within the $50,000 and $70,000 range. This uninspiring performance has sparked conversations about the current cycle, with several analysts and experts predicting whether the bull run is still on. Amongst the latest to comment is the CryptoQuant CEO, who offered an interesting on-chain insight into the cycle. Why Are Whales Taking Less Profit This Cycle? In a post on the X platform, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that the Bitcoin whales have held onto their assets this cycle. As a result, the large investors have set the record for the least profit-taking compared to other cycles if the current bull run ends now. Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst This on-chain revelation is based on the Realized Profit Ratio by Balance Cohort metric, which measures the ratio of coins sold at a profit by an investor class relative to the total coins sold at a given time. It basically evaluates the profitability of different cohorts of Bitcoin holders. Typically, when the Realized Profit Ratio of whales is high, it implies that a sell-off is likely ongoing, with the large investors believing that prices have peaked. On the other hand, a low Realized Profit Ratio often indicates a low level of profit-taking, meaning that investors are not cutting their losses or expecting further price gains. The current on-chain data points to a trend where the large holders have taken the least amount of profits across any bull cycle. This could mean that the Bitcoin whales still have faith in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Ultimately, this suggests that the current bull run is far from the end, and there is the possibility of the Bitcoin price uptrend resuming. Bitcoin ‘Dolphin’ Addresses On The Rise Again: Santiment In a post on X, Santiment revealed that the Bitcoin’s “Dolphin” cohort, holding between 0.1 to 10 BTC, have been growing steadily over the past few months. The analytics reported that this tier of investors mostly sold for profit in the first half of the year. However, addresses holding between 0.1 and 10 BTC have been on the rise since early July. Specifically, the 0.1 – 1 BTC wallets have increased by 25,671 more addresses, while the 1 – 10 BTC wallets have climbed by about 4,000 addresses.

On-Chain Data Exposes Declining Demand,2024-10-05 14:30:47+00:00,"SUI is currently testing a crucial supply zone following a massive 95% surge triggered by the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut announcement. The explosive rally, driven by significant buying pressure, has led to volatile price action, raising questions about whether this upward momentum can be sustained.  As SUI hovers near its current highs, market speculation is increasing around the possibility of a correction to lower demand levels, with $1.40 being the key target. Related Reading: Solana ‘In Serious Danger’ If $137 Support Breaks – Analyst Shares Targets Key data from Coinglass reveals a decline in market demand, signaling a potential slowdown in buying activity. This has left some investors on edge, as they anticipate a price drop in the coming days. The sudden surge has fueled both optimism and caution as traders weigh the potential for continued gains against the risk of a sharp reversal.  With SUI now at a critical juncture, the next few days will be pivotal in determining whether the bullish trend can continue or if the market will retrace to more stable demand levels. Investors are watching closely, ready to adjust their strategies based on the unfolding price action. SUI Funding Rate Signals Price Drop  SUI is at a critical point after days of extreme price action and significant gains. Following its impressive 95% rally since the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut announcement, some investors and traders are beginning to take profits, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. Many now view a correction to $1.40 as inevitable, especially as buying pressure cools down. Key data from Coinglass suggests a cooling demand, with the funding rate turning negative to -0.067, marking a yearly low. The funding rate is a key indicator in futures trading, representing the periodic payment between traders in long positions (betting on price increases) and those in short positions (betting on price declines).  When an asset’s funding rate turns negative, it indicates that more traders are opening short positions, expecting a drop in price. This shift reflects growing caution in the market as traders start positioning themselves for a potential downturn. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk Of Further Decline: Top Investor Sets $2,150 Target If Support Breaks With the funding rate at such a low and demand waning, the market is showing signs of cooling off after SUI’s explosive September rally. As a result, investors and traders are now patiently waiting for a correction to lower demand levels around $1.40, which could present new buying opportunities or signal further declines depending on the broader market conditions. Key Levels To Watch SUI is currently trading at $1.73 after experiencing days of volatile price action. The price surged but halted at the crucial $2 resistance level and has since entered a consolidation phase just below it. This key level has become a barrier for bulls, and a push above $2 is necessary for SUI to regain momentum and confirm a bullish trend. However, the market remains uncertain, and if the price fails to hold the $1.60 support level, a deeper correction could follow. Analysts predict that a break below $1.60 may lead to a 20% drop, bringing SUI down to the $1.40 demand zone. This level is being closely monitored by investors and traders as a critical support to prevent further downside pressure.

Dogecoin Whales Have Purchased Big Over The Last 24 Hours As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the DOGE whales have been participating in net buying recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of coins that a given Dogecoin wallet group is holding right now. In the context of the current topic, the whale cohort is of interest. The range of this group is typically defined as 100 million to 1 billion coins, with only addresses carrying a balance between these cutoffs qualifying for it. At the current exchange rate of the memecoin, this range converts to $10.9 million at the lower and $109 million at the upper end. Clearly, this cohort corresponds to the large investors and thanks to this size of theirs, they can carry some degree of influence in the market.  As such, the behavior of the whales can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may end up reflecting into the price of the cryptocurrency.

Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Supply Distribution for the whale entities over the last few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin supply held by the 100 million to 1 billion coins group saw a sharp increase last month, implying that the whales made large net buying moves. What followed this accumulation was a rally toward the end of the month, which took DOGE beyond the $0.13 level for the first time since July. Since this peak, though, the asset’s price has taken a significant blow, as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has witnessed bearish winds. Interestingly, despite the price crash, the supply of the whales has only shown a further increase, implying that the whales are scooping coins up at these lows, believing them to be offering a profitable window into the memecoin. During the last 24 hours alone, these humongous investors have participated in net accumulation of over 1 billion DOGE, worth $109 million. Given that the last buying spree from the group led to a rally, it’s possible that this one might also result in a similar outcome.

DOGE Price Dogecoin has outperformed the other top coins during the last 24 hours with a rally of almost 5%, which has taken its price to $0.109. Thus, it’s possible the bullish effect of the whale buying may already be starting to take hold. Featured image from Dall-E, Santiment.net, chart from TradingView.com",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum: 108,000 ETH Sent To Crypto Exchanges, Will Price Revisit $2,200?",2024-10-05 11:30:46+00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) has seen a 10.3% drop from last week’s highs following the recent market downturn. Its performance has worried many analysts and investors, considering ETH could be near another correction. Related Reading: Analysts Unfazed By Bitcoin (BTC) Drop, But Should We Fear October 5? Ethereum Whales Send Millions To Exchanges Ethereum has struggled to reclaim some key resistance levels since the October 1 correction. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency saw its price nosedive from the $2,600 zone to the $2,300 mark, hovering between the lower and higher range of that support level for the past few days. Since then, news of multiple investors moving their tokens has hit the industry, alarming the community. On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that an Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO) participant sold their tokens as the market bleed. Per the report, the whale deposited 12,010 ETH, worth $31.6 million, to Kraken a week ago after being inactive for two years. The same address sold another 19,000 ETH two days ago, around $47.54 million. Today, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that on October 3, roughly $259.2 million worth of ETH had been sent to crypto exchanges. According to the CryptoQuant data shared by Martinez, 108,000 ETH were sent to exchanges in the last 24 hours, significantly increasing from the day before. The news continued to fuel the bearish sentiment among many community members, who are disappointed about Ethereum’s performance and fear ETH’s price could soon face significant selling pressure. Will ETH Revisit Lower Levels Soon? Crypto investor Ted Pillows noted that ETH has been “one of the most underperforming cryptos in 2024.” Despite the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), the crypto has “underperformed almost every large cap.” He also pointed out that ETH surged alongside Bitcoin whenever the market was up but dropped significantly harder when the market struggled. “Whenever BTC has pumped 5%, ETH has pumped 3%, but whenever BTC has dumped 5%, ETH has dumped 12%-15%,” he remarked. However, Ted explained that every time Ethereum was considered “dead,” like in 2020-2021, it has eventually outperformed BTC. Based on this, the investor believes that ‘the king of Altcoins’ could face “one last flush” to $2,200 before the reversal. Similarly, trader Crypto General suggested that the cryptocurrency could retest the $4,000 by next month as he expects ETH to bounce from the current levels. However, he asserted that if the price breaks the trendline, “we can easily see the price touching the $2100 level.” Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Jumps 11% Following Acquisition Of Japanese Blockchain Developer HashPallette Other market watchers pointed out that Ethereum must reclaim the $2,400 resistance level to see a potential bounce toward $2,800. Previously, Daan Crypto Trades set the $2,850 resistance level as one of the key levels to watch. The analyst considers that reclaiming this level would signal a trend reversal for the cryptocurrency. This zone corresponds with the horizontal level that started the February-March run to ETH’s yearly high of $4,090. As of this writing, ETH has seen a positive price jump, currently trading at $2,431. This performance represents a 4.3% surge in the daily timeframe.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Hoskinson Claims Cardano Is ‘Still #1’ Crypto, Citing Decentralization And Upcoming Plans",2024-10-05 10:00:10+00:00,"The recent Chang hard fork upgrade in September has positioned the Cardano (ADA) blockchain as the top player in the crypto ecosystem, according to its founder, Charles Hoskinson.  Hoskinson, who is also known for his role in co-founding Ethereum (ETH), has consistently praised Cardano’s progress over the past month following the recent upgrade, asserting its superiority over the largest cryptocurrencies on the market such as Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of decentralization. Hoskinson Declares Cardano Remains Top Dog In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson reaffirmed Cardano’s status, claiming it is “still number 1.” This statement follows his remarks at the Token2049 Conference in Singapore, where he discussed the new governance model of the Cardano network.  Hoskinson emphasized that this model “redistributes power” from a select few to the broader community, addressing a key concern he sees with Ethereum’s “centralized structure.”  Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash Hoskinson pointed out that Ethereum’s reliance on its founder, Vitalik Buterin, creates “a bottleneck for innovation,” whereas Cardano’s Chang hard fork has established a framework that ensures ongoing development regardless of individual involvement. Hoskinson further highlighted how delegated representatives (DReps) can now engage with one another, vote, and utilize a blockchain-based governance system to regularly ratify the network’s roadmap. He stated emphatically, “Charles, alive or dead, doesn’t matter. There’s still going to be innovation on a daily basis.” In addition, the Cardano blockchain has shown significant growth in key metrics, boasting over 74,000 Plutus scripts and the creation of 1.3 million delegated wallets over the last seven years.  Additionally, approximately 1,373 projects have been launched on the platform, as highlighted in a commemorative video by Input Output Global (IOG), the development company behind the blockchain. Final Transition To Decentralized Governance? In his latest social media update, Hoskinson also remarked on Cardano’s advancements in decentralized governance, suggesting that the network is on the cusp of achieving remarkable milestones with upcoming features. Looking ahead, Cardano aims to replace its initial genesis keys, which have been instrumental in managing the network since its inception. This transition will be supported by increased participation from stake pool operators (SPOs) and DReps, as well as the establishment of a Constitutional Committee (CC). Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst The next steps toward achieving a fully decentralized governance model involve ensuring that stake pool nodes meet operational thresholds and that decentralized applications (DApps) are nearing completion.  The final transition to the Voltaire era, signifying a fully self-sustaining blockchain, will occur with the final use of the Genesis keys, triggering another hard fork. However, further announcements and dates for these developments have yet to be released by IOG or the blockchain’s founder. At the time of writing, Cardano’s native token ADA trades at $0.352, recording a 2% price surge in the last 24 hours.   Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,solana,Anyone else find crypto twitter to be completely unbearable,2024-10-05 20:51:23,"Has anyone figured out how to trade without using crypto twitter

95% of the content is extractive, farming, shilling or spamming nonsense.  I dont like most of the KOLs, everyone is untrustworthy and more and more it appears to be a huge circlejerk among insiders.  

it got even worse when Elon started paying for impressions cuz now people just say and post anything

A lot of these kols arent nteresting enough to do content outside of their memecoin success, which is fine but its irritating when their cringe content gets pushed to the front because of the idea that somewhere somehow theres money on the table by giving attention to their posts.

Has anyone managed to make a profitable trading experience without using it?

Dont get me wrong it can be useful but overall its an extremely negative experience for me and my mental headspace is way clearer when im not using it.

Though I've set Devnet everywhere, I still get this Network mismatch error, where it says that the transaction is for mainnet. Now I did a bit of research and found out that it's a bug with Solflare and they are working on resolving it. So for the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't give users the option to connect Solflare wallet, but unfortunately I'm unable to do so. I have not included solflare wallet in my code:

      const wallets = useMemo(
        () => [

          new LedgerWalletAdapter(),

          new MathWalletAdapter(),
        ],
        []
      );

But still the app shows Solflare wallet as option as it is already installed on my laptop. Is there any way to exclude Solflare wallet. I want to make sure that users only see the above wallets in the list to connect and no other wallet, irrespective of whether I've them installed or not.

Reddit,solana,Profiting from copy traders,2024-10-05 12:55:54,"I was just thinking if it theoretically would be possible to profit from copy traders.

Wouldn’t it be possible to track which wallet someone is copy trading then find a way to buy the coin before the copy trader is buying so that you can sell it for more after the copy trader has bought? 

The way I would manage to buy before the copy trader is to have my own custom bot that is faster than the one many copy traders are buying on telegram. I would assume that because those telegram bots are built for the mass and not for only one person that they’re slower. 

I have knowledge in Rust which is one of the fastest programming languages. And I could write such a bot in Rust.
I doubt that the telegram copy trading bots are also using rust, as it’s way simpler to create a telegram bot with something like NodeJS or Python. 

I could find wallets that are being copy traded by just checking who bought the same coin a few seconds later. My goal would be to buy the same coin after the wallet that’s being copy traded but before the copy trader buys. Then once the copy trader buys I would instantly sell it, which should turn it into a profit. 

I have never bought any copy trading bot so if anyone of you has, it would be great if you could share some info with me.

Do you think this possible? ",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,solana,What is the viability of implement smart contracts in day to day operations?,2024-10-04 21:39:05,"Hi all! 

I am a developer and I am currently hyper focused on blockchain and crypto environment, specially on the matters of Smart Contracts. 

I am very interested in how I believe smart contracts could disrupt a lot of fields, so I started digging into the development aspect of it. However, one thing that really got me worrying, is the transaction cost of these nets. 

Even solana, with one of the lowest fees, the cost seems pretty unreasonable to develop anything at scale. 

I imagine that there are a lot of workarounds developers do to minimize costs, so I wanted to get your opinion on how viable are these costs in terms of development in scale and what are some of the ways people often use to minimize costa and structure a smart contract, and use it in real life applications.

I am also interested in use cases where companies uses these public nets, but abstracts the usage of blockchain, in a way that the user would not need to worry about creating wallets, managing keys and withdrawing money. So any insights on that matter are also welcome! 

Thank you!

Update: Just to make myself clearer, I do think that for use cases such as transferring money from accounts, or any other applications where each user has a wallet and it’s well informed about transaction costs and deal with them by themselves, the taxes are way lower than traditional transfer methods. However my main point is that most of the people do not want or do not care about having a wallet, and they are not informed at all about tramsaction fees and crypto buying. In these cases, to reduce barrier of entries, one might think of a solution where a third-party (the app, let’s say so) is responsible for abstrancting all these things, which means that the app itself will do the transactions internally. That’s where I think the cost rise up pretty quickly.",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Here's more of the latest news for Solana devs...  


### 🏗️ Steel Framework

Steel is a new open-source framework developed by Regolith Labs (Ore) to simplify the development of programs on the Solana blockchain.

The framework originated out of a desire to streamline common tasks, reduce boilerplate code, and provide more efficient interfaces for Solana development.

Steel provides a collection of tools and helper functions to reduce the complexity of Solana program development by simplifying the handling of tasks like instruction parsing, cross-program invocations (CPIs), and account data validation.

It's a work in progress but already provides several tools aimed at improving the developer experience:

**Entrypoint Simplification:** Steel reduces the entrypoint boilerplate code by offering helper functions to parse instructions before dispatching to core logic, speeding up initial setup.

**Loaders for Account Data:** Steel includes loaders to parse and validate account data, which are expected to evolve to return mutable or readonly references to inner account data.

**Simplified CPIs:** Common CPIs such as creating token accounts, transferring, minting, and burning tokens are simplified, making interactions between programs easier and more efficient.

Features like initialization scripts, IDL generation, and a no-std-entrypoint for performance optimization are part of Steel's roadmap.

Steel encourages contributions from the Solana developer community to help it grow and evolve as more developers get involved.

### 🏙️ Jupiter Metropolis API

The Metropolis API Platform by Jupiter introduces a powerful set of liquidity tools designed to streamline access to liquidity on Solana.

The platform consists of three key APIs:

**Token API:** This API provides detailed token information, including enhanced token metadata and community-verified token tags. It serves as a reliable source of truth for developers and protocols, offering token data that users can trust when interacting with tokens.

**Price API (V2):** The second version of the Price API delivers enriched, real-time price data and historical swap information from Jupiter.

It includes features like Confidence Level, indicating the reliability of the price, especially useful for tokens with wide spreads, and Liquidity Depth, which shows available liquidity and potential price impacts on larger trades.

**Swap API:** Designed to facilitate seamless transactions, this API provides features such as Dynamic Slippage and Instant Routing. It helps developers access the best token swap prices and estimates priority fees for successful transaction completion.

Metropolis aims to simplify integration with Solana’s liquidity, empowering developers to build sustainable applications by providing real-time, accurate, and comprehensive liquidity data.

### 💳 Squads Card SDK

The Squads Card SDK leverages the programmability and security of Squads Protocol smart accounts, which power the self-custodial architecture behind [Fuse Pay](https://fusewallet.com/blog/fuse-pay?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a virtual Visa card that allows users to spend stablecoins in real-world transactions directly from their Fuse wallet.

When a user creates a card account, a separate smart account is deployed, with the main Fuse account acting as the signer. 

The SDK will allow other projects to easily integrate similar functionality, enabling them to launch card products on Solana with full user control, customizable spending limits, and time-locked withdrawals.

For developers, the Squads Card SDK opens up new opportunities to build card-based products that merge on-chain assets with everyday spending. 

Squads Protocol is actively seeking design partners to help shape the future of the Squads Card SDK. 

By participating in the design phase, developers can contribute to the SDK’s development, ensure it meets real-world needs, and take part in creating the next generation of Solana-based payment solutions.

Interested developers can reach out directly to the Squads team via DMs or participate in discussions on Solana developer forums.

### ⛓️ Wormhole Era3

**Wormhole Era3** brings upgrades to enhance cross-chain interoperability and improve UX, offering Solana developers new features to build on.

1. **Composable Intents**: Developers can chain multiple cross-chain actions into a single transaction, allowing for seamless asset swaps, DeFi operations, and other complex tasks across multiple blockchains, including Solana.
2. **Native Token Transfers (NTT)**: A new framework that eliminates liquidity fragmentation by preserving the native properties of tokens during transfers, meaning assets maintain their intrinsic qualities when moved across chains without needing to be wrapped. This ensures secure and fluid token movement for projects and financial institutions building on Solana.
3. **Enhanced SDKs**: The Wormhole TypeScript SDK has been revamped, making it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications with advanced UI/UX capabilities.
4. **Institutional Integrations**: Wormhole's new offerings cater to institutional needs, enabling Solana developers to build applications that align with capital markets and RWAs, as seen with partnerships like Securitize and integrations with Google Cloud and AMD.

These improvements in Era3 provide Solana developers tools for building multichain dApps while ensuring security and flexibility.

### 🔒 Hypernative on Solana

Solana projects now have access to Hypernative's platform, including a dedicated risk dashboard and incident response support to enhance security for Solana’s developer ecosystem.

Hypernative’s platform monitors a wide range of risks, including program vulnerabilities, phishing, scams, and market manipulations, offering real-time threat detection and response for both the network and projects building on it. 

Solana is now among more than 130 Web3 projects that utilize Hypernative's enterprise-grade platform, which monitors over $37 billion in digital assets across 40+ blockchains.

Developers building or managing funds on Solana can request a demo of Hypernative’s platform.

Reddit,solana,How long does TX confirmation take? ,2024-10-03 17:19:32,"Solana is a high throughput blockchain and I'm expecting the transactions confirmation to go very fast. 

I'm experimenting with some trading strategies and I noticed that whenever I submit a transaction it takes somewhere close to 15-ish seconds. The fastest one I managed to see so far was 7 seconds. Is that expected? What are some best practices for performing fast transactions?

I know, sometimes the network gets congested but even when it's not this is still a problem. 

I tried using the public mainnet RPC as well as some free tier RPC nodes from Alchemy and Quiknode and the results are about the same. I also tried to increase the priority fee, which, imo, doesn't make much difference. 

I saw some traders performing sandwhiching, where they manage to pack 2 transactions into one block having a single transaction in between. Is that only possible with running a private RPC node or a Validator? ",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

As always, the effectiveness (speed) of the sniper depends on which RPC you are using, you can configure a public one (not recommended), or the one you have or simply use Smithii's premium RPC (fast node).

I recently ran it for four hours with 0.1 SOL for the buying amount and made a 100% profit (10 buy/sell cycles - 2 nonprofitable). My settings were 30% take profit, 20% SL, 40% slippage and the only active filter was burn LP, all other settings were default.

Also, I’m curious about the risk that one assumes when launching a coin. Do these rug pullers have any risk or serious overhead costs? I see there are plenty of cheap easy ways to launch new shitcoins.  If you’re pumping your own coin on launch (on DexScreener Moonshot, for example) but no one is buying, I assume that would mean that there’s no real liquidity. If no one is there to buy, then the SOL you pumped into your new coin disappears because there’s no one to dump to. Am I correct in my assessment? I’ve always traded bigger coins with huge caps and plenty liquidity. I’ve never understood the concept of a startup coin. Maybe I’m missing fundamental knowledge of how the market works. My ROI% is a solid -40% so far. Small sample size but most of it was due to rug pulls within 8 hrs of a coin’s launch.
Any insight or resource is greatly appreciated. Ty  ",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

I did some sleuthing in my wallet as this thing is in my wallet too.: but then i saw other addresses too that,have also sent me 0.000001 sol. I looked o
into those and:
THOSE ARE ADRESS POISONING SCAMS.

I dont know how it exactly enters my wallet but what it does is this:

It sends 0.000001 sol to your wallet after you interact with a TRUSTED address. 
And when you look at the SENDER address, it ALMOST looks EXACTLY like the address you used to do a legitimate transaction to/with.

Example: you have 2 wallets. 
Wallet 1 is called  ABC1....9XYZ

You send 1 sol from wallet 1 to wallet 2.

Then the scambot immediately sends 0.000001 sol 
to wallet 2 .
When you look in wallet 2, you see the transaction of what wallet 1 has sent (legitimate)
PLUS you will see OTHER transaction of what the SCAMBOT has sent you.
When you look at the scambot/sender address, you will notice that THE ADDRESS IS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE LEGITIMATE ADDRESS 

        Wallet 1   (SAFE)  ABC1....9XYZ

other sender        (SCAM)  ABOI... PXYZ

another send        (SCAM) ABCi....gXYZ

CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE A POISONING SCAM ATTEMPT. when you do not pay attention you could EASILY copy the WRONG address to send your funds to.

It sends you transactions from addresses that look like the ones you trust and interacted with in the past.
It does this immediately. I made a fresh wallet and sent 1 sol to it, As soon as i received my 1 sol there were THREE OTHER sends of 0.00001 sol from addresses that looks ALMOST IDENTICAL.

Reddit,solana,World record egg big rug ,2024-10-02 05:36:01,"Hey everyone,

I want to shed light on a recent scam involving the World Record Egg Instagram account — you know, the one famous for having the most-liked post ever.

The account was recently acquired by a new team, but instead of just riding on its popularity, they decided to use it for launching several Solana-based cryptocurrency projects. Their end goal? Draining investor funds using shady tactics, like controlling the majority of the token supply and dumping large amounts (150k, 50k $SOL) repeatedly, which resulted in a Rug Pull and left many investors at a huge loss.

What happened:

	•	Leveraged the World Record Egg brand to build credibility.
	•	Launched three separate tokens.
	•	Manipulated the supply, dumped tokens at a high price, and caused the value to crash while cashing out with millions.
	•	Complete lack of transparency regarding the real people behind the new projects.

What you can do:

	1.	Report this scam wherever you see them promoting their projects.
	2.	Stay vigilant if you follow the account, and don’t get lured in by investment promises.
	3.	Share this post to spread the word so others don’t fall for it.

If you or anyone you know has been affected, feel free to reach out. I’m trying to gather as many victims as possible to escalate this issue and hand over a complete report to the financial authorities.

Stay safe and protect your investments!

I’m building a new meme coin on the solana chain of course and one of the utilities that I’m planing to do is to let the community buy goods by using the meme coin. 
The contract I need to create is that with every purchase immediately 10% of the money will go to a burn and the other will transfer to usdt so I can exchange it to USD to pay for the goods for the suppliers.

Is it possible?
That means that the site payment should be accepting solana wallets and I want it to be able to accept only the spoken meme coin.

Reddit,solana,Blockchain Vending Platform powered by Solana,2024-10-01 00:17:27,"Hey Solana Community,

I'm Will Okojie, co-founder of chebeMCHN, and I wanted to share something that’s been in the works for a while now. We’re building a smart vending platform that goes beyond just convenience — we’re leveraging the power of the Solana ecosystem to completely reimagine how vending machines operate. 🚀

Our vision? Imagine walking up to a vending machine, paying with your favorite stablecoins, and getting more than just a snack or a drink — you get an NFT receipt tied to your purchase, unlocking rewards, discounts, and some pretty cool perks down the line. 🌟 Not only that, but we’re aiming to integrate loyalty programs where members can actually earn from staking the funds we keep on-chain. It’s about giving back to the community and creating a platform that’s rewarding in more ways than one.

We’ve launched our first machine in Denver and are rolling out new locations soon, and we’re pumped to start integrating Solana’s fast, secure, and low-cost network to make all this possible.

It’s still early days for us, but Solana’s tech is giving us the flexibility to offer everything from stablecoin payments to NFTs and staking rewards—all through a vending machine! Who would’ve thought?

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any advice as we work toward bringing this project to life. Excited to be part of this community and can’t wait to see where this journey with Solana takes us.

One of them, 


Memecoins are solely created with the motive of merging with other memecoins and garnering a bigger community. 
Every memecoin bonded on the platform will be deployed on raydium with 500k in liquidity. 

Memecoins merge with other memecoins. 
Communities merge with other communities. 
Bigger cult. Bigger pump. 

Memecoins are created in tranches, each memecoin has to reach a threshold to merge with other ones.
Everytime a memecoin is created a parallel telegram chat is spawned. 
Everytime a memecoin is about to merge. A new telegram chat is formed with a new name. Where community members are redirected and can now chat. Increasing the size of the community and number of holders. 
The name can be bid on by the community and names can be decided on the fly. Community V community. 

Once a memecoin reaches a threshold supply is added for more buyers to come in. 
It repeats itself till we have 500k in mc.

Reddit,ethereum,"When using Groth16 on Ethereum through ᴇɪᴘ‒197, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-05 21:22:04,"First remember Ethereum only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result… Otherwise I recognize this is more a mathematical problem but the place where I’m the most likely to find someone who do understand it remains on Ethereum as it’s partly cryptocurrency math specific.

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

We had already started developing the tool and I knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online).

About 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and I downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (I know it’s dumb I don’t need to be lectured about it I know). That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money.

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/33gtnpdf7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=42da675ea3e71c74f71a7b294b547888e8219be3

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

🔗 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

The article dives deep into the structure of a stablecoin and discovers the hidden integral relationship between the functions and the variables.

This guide will help you understand an ERC-20 token stablecoin smart contract in depth. The article describes each function of the smart contract's intertwined contracts and shows you the dependencies among them. The dissected smart contract establishes strong security measures against prevailing smart contract vulnerabilities that can guide you to build your own ERC-20 token.

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

I've confirmed the issues are not related to my JWT and it is not a network/port forwarding related issue.

Does anyone else have this problem with Geth? I'm ready to throw in the towel and switch to a Besu/Teku setup but damn I hate walking away from something like this without understanding why it isn't working

It should be just 2 seconds on L2 and 15 seconds on L1, cost $0.002 on L2 and $0.1 on L1.

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

Reddit,ethereum,Account Abstraction: Crypto Beyond Private Keys,2024-09-18 14:46:04,"Chances are, you have come across the term “account abstraction,” but you don’t know what it means. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll simplify it, explain why account abstraction matters and how it works technically, and provide a practical example to help you understand it.

https://preview.redd.it/uliy7j98ykpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab67cd97bb20fc124f47e8b6b274325d3462423

Let’s dive into this fascinating topic and see how it can transform your understanding of cryptocurrency.

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

https://preview.redd.it/d6l81mocxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af084112a700012423b3838f16662eb37501dbcd

# Why the Current Setup Falls Short (Lacunas do Sistema Atual)

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/cio8hwgfxkpd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20a3703848b92783e55ea0dfd73e806dba78490

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/iegallxsxkpd1.png?width=2751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb0b8618ebf50cb583ad8fddacc7bedd411d7b3

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Are you staking solo? What’s your take on his proposal?

I've never really understood or been passionate about ETH like I am with bitcoin so, up until now, I've just kept it in case it shoots up in value, whereas with my BTC I never plan to sell.

My question for the ETH community, what would be the reasons for keeping it?

I'm inclined to just buy more BTC with it and forget about ETH altogether but if there's a compelling argument to keep it, then I'm open ears.

Reddit,ethereum,Can KYC Add Security Without Compromising Decentralization? 🤔 ,2024-09-16 19:18:52,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about the whole “not your keys, not your funds” philosophy, and while I agree with it, I also feel like there’s room for added security, especially when it comes to fund recovery and preventing fraud.

What if we implemented KYC for wallets, but without compromising decentralization? 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. KYC data stored in decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin) instead of traditional databases. That way, no central authority holds your personal data.


2. Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs) to verify users without actually exposing their identity. This means users could prove ownership or compliance without revealing any personal information—maintaining privacy and transparency.


3. The focus is not on managing private keys, but on fund recovery in case of hacks or scams, and ensuring more transparency in the system without adding centralized control.



In my opinion, this would add an extra layer of security and verifiability without compromising on decentralization or privacy. It could also help with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and offer a way to recover funds without needing full central control.

What do you all think? Could this work as a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to improve wallet security and fund recovery? Or do you think it’s still too centralized, even with decentralized storage and ZK proofs?

I'm stills new to the space.

Reddit,ethereum,A Comprehensive Guide: How To Calculate Your Celsius Losses (with examples!),2024-09-15 16:51:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

As far as I understood, they defined sigma(a) as the account state and sigma(a)\_s as the storageRoot hash of the Merkle trie that has all the account's storage data. L\* is the collapse function that hashes all the key value pairs. So, I am guessing they are using the equivalent relationship to connect the Merkle Trie with the trie's root hash. But why is L\* also taking the storageRoot hash?

Reddit,ethereum,Sharing my Fitness DApp project,2024-09-12 14:01:57,"Hey everyone! 👋  
I'm working on a hybrid DApp that tracks steps and runs fitness tournaments, with rewards for the top performers. Here's a quick breakdown of the project:

# Why Blockchain?

For tournaments, I needed a **trustless system** where user steps are transparent and verifiable. So, I used blockchain to store the steps data, making it tamper-proof and easily auditable by anyone.

# Tech Stack:

* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat
* **Testing:** Chai, Mocha
* **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB
* **Client:** Unity (C#)

# How It Works:

* The **client-side** is built in **Unity**, but since there's limited blockchain support in Unity, I'm using **REST APIs** to connect to a traditional backend.
* Most smart contract interactions (like registering steps) happen on the backend, and Unity communicates with it via APIs.

Still in development, but I’m really excited about how it’s shaping up! Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback! 🙌

Feel free to go through the repos:

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,I knew Len Sassaman as a teenager,2024-10-06 00:15:31,"I am not much of a bitcoiner but i saw the headlines recently and was shocked but then it all made sense. I am now 100% convinced Len is Satoshi. 

I was active in the Philadelphia area bbs/irc scene back in the day and that's where i met Len aka rabbi. It was probably circa 1995-1998 and he would have been  in his late teens. We were online friends  and talked daily. At one point i got him a job interview at the company i worked (Magpage In Hockessin, DE was an early dialup ISP) but the owners thought he was strange. 

Eventually my friend Sheri got him a job at PDC Solutions which was like a Sun Microsystems integrator or VAR. That company failed some time around 2003.

It's been 30 years and I don't remember much. But i do very distinctly remember he drove like a 1980-1985 BMW 3 series when he was around age 18. I remember it being a dark color maybe even with a shade of purple. We lost touch after some years but we'd chat sometimes after he left USA. 

I have an old Pine mailbox i am trying to unearth where i would have communicated with Len back in the day. Maybe there's some mention or reference that helps solve the puzzle. 

Now that i see the headline it makes total sense. Len even at a very young age was the most intellectual person in the room. He had the knowledge and critical thinking of an engineer with 30 years experience even as a teenager. He is one of those people that God brings to earth with a gift, contributes something to progress our universe forward and just as quickly takes them away. 

This isnt a post for clout but instead to make some more record of the life of someone important.

Reddit,bitcoin,Studying Comptia Security+. Presently studying cryptographic algorithms and the history of cryptography. I feel like the quantum treat is at least 20 years away.,2024-10-05 16:26:25,"Please take what I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm not a dev, nor a coder. I'm simply studying for something that can bolster my career moving forward.               

Doing a brief search on the world's first invented cryptographic algorithm, known as ""Data Encryption Standard"", it was invented in the 1970s. It was broken by a brute force attack in 1997 that took 56 hours to complete. There were attempts to extend the usefulness of DES by (my own words, no one elses) tripling the number of times it encrypts and re-encrypts information. DES was 56-bit encryption. ""Triple DES"" was essentially 111 bit encryption.               

At this point, organizations came together to formulate a new encryption standard and created a cryptographic algorithm for web browsing and information sharing that almost everyone uses today known as ""Advanced Encryption Standard"" (AES).            

My postulation is that, given the timeline between the introduction of DES to the time it was cracked, and given the introduction of quantum computers and that they are presently very weak (not to mention the fact that the components need to operate at nearly absolute zero (literally -273 degrees celsius (-460 degrees farenheit))), I view the quantum threat to Sha-256 as null now, and needing at least 20 years of development to break sha-256. Further, for perspective, to construct a quantum computer that could do this in today's numbers, the computer would need to be the size of a football field.            

**All of the difficulties associated with breaking SHA-256 placed to the side, would it be possible to use a soft-fork similar to speedy trial back in 2021 to move to a new hashing algorithm?**",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,bitcoin,Side Gigs for stacking Sats,2024-10-05 12:47:01,"Exactly five days ago, I asked in this Reddit about more possibilities to sack sats than to go to work at our FIAT mines.

Now I have my four winners:

1) Get on Nostr. It is a social media platform and by providing value (comments, photos, even memes) you will get zapped Satoshis. Please be a part of the community and zap also back, it is like an upvote at Reddit!

2) Ember. It is an app (Apple & Google Store) where you can mine together with your friends and contacts. I make currently something like 15-20 Sats an hour(!) by only investing about 10 minutes a day. I have a referral in case you want a kickstart (+10 sats/hr) over there. 

3) Fountain App for podcast listening. There are great podcasts over there about Bitcoin, politics, but you can also listen to your standard Apple Podcast / Spotify podcasts over there. Every day you will get a few sats for listening! No brainer 🧡

4) THNDR Games. They have a few mini games (Bitcoin Snake, Tetris) where you can play a little and get Sats every hour. It is not much, I usually get for one game of Snake which takes maybe 2 minutes like 4 sats. Payout is every hour and it is connected to Wallets like Strike, Primal and Wallet of Satoshi, so it is super intuitive. I have made here maybe 100-200 sats and play from time to time just for fun.

If you know any more, I’d be happy to hear your recommendations! Keep stacking guys!

If it were up to me, I’d put it all in Bitcoin :) Is that even possible? How would I move all that to my cold wallet? If so how much in fees would it be to do that?

Reddit,bitcoin,"Looking for feedback on a theory of how money is created that solves the issue of Bitcoin's ""intrinsic value.""",2024-10-04 16:07:14,"Hi everybody, I'm in the behavioral sciences. I don't want to dox myself but my work has been covered, cited, and taught in a few classrooms. Anyway I noticed something a few years ago from behavior that happened to also apply to how money can appear in society, and I couldn't resist working on and formalizing it even though I'm not an economist and don't know any. But this is pretty relevant to the arguments people have about bitcoin and how it supposedly lacks ""intrinsic value."" Anyway here's a brief outline.

1. People have made different claims for where money's value comes from. Some say government fiat, but government can't control money when it hyperinflates. Some have said trust, or that money is useful because you can use it as money, but these take a form of circular logic. They don't explain why the first people want forms of money before they're widely known or anyone wants to trade for them. To counter this, some people have pointed out that money starts out as something practically useful, like wheat or cigarettes in prison, that then gets traded. But gold didn't have practical use before things like electroplating or dentistry, but was still valued. And even the beauty of gold doesn't explain why other beautiful things, like crystals or pyrite, didn't have the same value. And likewise, bitcoin has no appearance or supposed practical use at all. But it turns out the desire for it is based on real value, like so...
2. People have a tendency to keep scarce and unfamiliar items, since they might be potentially useful, in the same way we keep knick-knack drawers at home. And having those items means that the person was either able to go to unfamiliar territories to find them, meaning they had more capability than average, or they acquired the item through force or treachery from someone who had gone there, meaning they still were more capable than average. Because of that higher capability and those items sometimes turning to genuinely be more useful (like making sharper weapons), these people survived more often than average.
3. These people also had friends and mates, who were more likely to survive as well because they were with someone who was more capable than average and they had items that sometimes were more useful as well.
4. As a result, people over time developed an instinct to want scarce items and to want to be around people who had scarce items. People then would display their scarce items as well as a sign of capability, and sometimes give those scarce items to others to show that they are allied with capable people or capable themselves.
5. The scarce items that were durable (could be displayed longer), evenly divisible (so they could be smaller gifts or represent smaller amounts of value), hard to fake (so they were more reliable as signs of fitness) and transferable and so on got traded around more often and eventually became what we call money.
6. Bitcoin has an instinctive attraction to people who know about its programmed scarcity for the same reason we are attracted to any other item we know is scarce. And this attraction is based on real survival value (having scarce items shows capability still today) and thus bitcoin has a real basis for why people want it. On top of, of course, now being useful for trade.

What I like about this is that, in addition to showing why money without ""practical use"" actually is still based on real value, it indicates that you don't need government or some organizer to create or force ""trust"" or ""agreement"" among people for any form of money to exist. It simply occurs on its own if it has the necessary traits. And even if people don't agree or think a form of money isn't valuable, we'll still evolve those urges over time (and thus our interest and use of money) because people have real reason to keep scarce items, and the value they provide in their use and what they show about someone's fitness is real as well and will effect our evolution.

Anyway I'm asking people who have a background in economics and the related theories what they think about this, and would appreciate any feedback someone has. I have drafted a couple preprints on this that go into a lot more detail on it, and I may publish it if it does turn out to have any use. ",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Let's say, S&P 500 gets a constant bid from investors all across and they keep allocating money on a monthly basis, while s&p 500 doesn't have a fixed supply a constant bid to buy s&p 500 would make it an up only asset isn't it?  And could keep going up even if s&p 500 gets overvalued.

For example, when liquidity is high, more capital tends to flow into riskier assets like BTC. But in tighter liquidity conditions, investors might shy away from volatile assets.

Has anyone else considered this? What are your thoughts on how much global liquidity affects Bitcoin's price cycles compared to the halving?",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,bitcoin,A truly inspiring Bitcoin story...,2024-10-03 01:04:36,"***** This story is not mine. It was posted 12h ago on [Twitter](https://x.com/BitBuyer313/status/1841459316051603874) by [@BitBuyer313](https://x.com/BitBuyer313)

No matter how hopeless and bleak your financial situation is, never give up. Here's my own personal story and a peek into my past.

Let's rewind back to 2011, I was 5 years into a drug and drinking problem, got a DUI, went to prison and when I got out I was over $30k in debt due to fines, lawyer fees etc.

I had to move back into my dad's house and the drug problem continued.
By 2013 most of my friends were dead from drug overdoses, or in prison and I was still $25k in debt.
I realized I was going to end up dead or in prison as well if I didn't make a change.

I managed to find myself an efficiency apartment I could afford, and the local fire department was gracious enough to give me a chance since my prison record was only DUI related.
I worked full time, and on evenings and weekends I went to fire school for an entire summer (till I was interior certified), helped with fundraisers, and started paying off my debt.

Being on the flip side of drugs was a sobering experience, most of the medical calls we ran were fentanyl overdoses and it was eye opening to see the devastation drugs caused the immediate family members of the addicted individual, I witnessed more death in one year than most people will experience in their entire lives.

Surrounding myself with a new group of friends from the fire dept and staying busy by working and volunteering 24/7 was enough to keep me out of trouble. 

By 2016 my debt was finally paid off and I actually had several grand in savings but never thought I'd be able to retire due to understanding how rampantly out of control inflation was, I was looking into gold, real estate etc. to figure out where I could start parking my money, but nothing seemed to be the perfect solution.

Then one day in early summer of 2017 I discovered Bitcoin while watching a documentary on the silk road. I was immediately fascinated. I studied it for a couple weeks and finally pulled the trigger making my first purchases 2 weeks before the fork wars kicked into full gear.

I was unsure if I made the right decision at the time, my friends laughed at me, and my family was concerned I fell victim to a Ponzi scheme, but I didn't let any criticism dissuade me. Then came the euphoric pump to $20k, I felt vindicated till the price collapsed and I received even more mockery for not selling. This rinse and repeat happened for another full cycle, but I had made up my mind that I was riding my #Bitcoin stack to zero or to a million. 

With each passing year my conviction only grew stronger as my knowledge on the topic increased.

Fast forward to present day and I have a higher net worth then the average median retiree and I'm only in my mid 30s. 

Thanks to #Bitcoin and the grace of God, I not only have my life back on track, but I'm looking at retiring a couple decades early which will allow me to pursue my true passions.

If you made it this far, I appreciate your time and hope this can inspire even one person who feels like their situation is hopeless.

Getting yourself out of a deep hole when the odds are stacked against you isn't easy, but nothing is impossible and it gets easier with each passing day.

I wish you all the best of luck in your own individual journeys through life.
Keep stacking Bitcoin and with time, you will be rewarded.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Spent $1600 and 2 months doing CopyTrading, these are the results:",2024-10-05 20:41:05,"Hey everyone!

So a couple months ago I had some money laying around and I decided I wanted to try new things to see if I could earn some extra bucks. As background, I knew I could risk this money since I have a good joob and I didn't need it to survive, and I like crypto (bad combination some would say).

That's when I remembered Binance has this feature where you can copy trade people and share the profits. So I bought some USDT and sent it to my Binance account to get started.

# Initial Strategy

I have some experience with trading, but nothing too crazy. And I'm very familiar with the crypto world, I joined in 2019. But despite that, I never tried copy trading in general, let alone using Binance platform, so I wasn't really sure of what strategy to follow.

After some thought, I decided I didn't want to put all the eggs in a single basket, and decided I wanted to ""test"" the traders before giving them more money. Especially because I was going to use futures instead of spot trading.

I started testing the traders with an initial balance of 50 USDT, and I'd increase it on a monthly basis depending on their results.

I didn't know what to expect, so I chose the traders mainly on PnL/ROI, but that was pretty much it.

# First revisions

As you may expect already, choosing traders based on PnL/ROI was kind of a mistake. Some of the traders were super aggressive and used high amounts of leverage (one of them was using x125 lol), meaning that they were getting crazy returns when they won, but also losing pretty much everything when they lost.

After the first month I realized this and started searching for traders that matched a specific criteria, traders must have the following:

* Decent amount of days in the platform (+100 ideally)
* Low amount of previosuly closed wallets (less than 3 ideally)
* Decent returns but not crazy in the last 90 days (10/-50% range)
* Steady PnL/ROI chart upwards
* Low MDD (around 20% max)
* Decent sharpe ratio

As you can see, I became more selective with the traders that I choose (and I will probably continue adjusting this based on the results), and I stopped expecting quick crazy returns.

# Results

In total I copied 20 different traders and as a way to share the results, I created a spreadsheet where you can better visualize the results that I got divided by each trader:

[https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/DwyokbQ.jpeg)

*NOTE: PnL for traders currently open include PnL for open positions, and does not include profit sharing (usually 10%).*

As you can see, most of the traders that I started copying during first month are now closed. Main reason is that I didn't like their strategy/risk management and I didn't feel comfortable copying them, or they directly lost everything.

Luckily, second batch of traders I chose using the adjusted strategy seem to be doing good. But it's still early to jump into conclusions since I started copying them less than a month ago. I wait at least a month before deciding to give them more capital as I mentioned before.

# Final Numbers

In order to better visualize the results, I created this simple summary:

[https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/MxtGKBq.jpeg)

As you can see, despite all the loses, I still managed to earn 129USDT, close to 8% return in 2 months. Mainly thanks to a single trader that I deployed more capital to and did extremely good. 🙏

# Conclusions & How to continue

I think that the adjustment in the strategy was a good choice that will help me to reduce the risks when choosing traders to copy, so I will continue adjusting and improving it as I gather more data.

Also, since I wanted to have multiple options, I tested a ton of traders, but as I continue adjusting the strategy, I will start reducing the amount of new traders that I give an opportunity to so I can focus on giving more capital to the ones that I already have and that are doing good.

The idea is to stabilize the returns by having different traders with different strategies (but always inside a certain range) and start to slowly deploy more capital so I can increase the $$ returns.

# Thank you!

Hope you liked this post. I created it mainly to share the results I got and get some feedback from more experienced people.

I know copytrading is usually a very controversial topic but hopefully we can share our knowledge between us!",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

2. **48.71%** of all transactions through Raydium are failing. 

3. Transactions will fail for a **variety of reasons** not just slippage issues. 

4. Voting consensus transactions & failed transactions massively bloat the blockchain size, **currently \~265 TB & growing fast.** 

5. Again, **TPS includes voting consensus and failed transactions**, failed transactions on most other blockchains are strictly validated before even hitting the blockchain. 

6. **Firedancer** is live on mainnet, but in 'non-voting mode' which means it cannot produce blocks and is **only doing about \~30% of what a validator does.** 

7. **RPC endpoint architecture allows operators to reorder transactions and front-run.** 

8. ***$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.*** (Repeated due to importance). 

9. **5 million daily active users is a myth, 4.5 million of these hold 0 SOL, and much more hold < 1, they are created with an intention to inflate metrics,** notice the large uptick in August, also 1 user(bot) could technically have 4 million wallets. 

10. **The Top 18 validators control +33% of the entire staked Solana supply, meaning they can collaboratively block consensus and censor transactions.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

Then we entered the institutional period, where it seemed like crypto would move into a phase of real maturity and strong development.

**BTC**: A rally driven by the promise of a Spot ETF, after crashing to under 20k. Maybe the Spot ETF is the only good thing after 2021.

**NFTs**: A bad joke that didn’t hold appeal among celebrities and didn’t help the market in any way.

**Consecutive SEC lawsuits**: Almost every project issuing tokens was pursued by the SEC, undermining the market’s legitimacy.

**Frauds**: Scandals like FTX and other frauds further tarnished the market’s image.

**Memecoins**: The frenzy around meme coins adds chaos and gives critics more reason to dismiss this market as not serious.

**Venture Capital shitcoins**: Billions of locked tokens being dumped on us on a regular basis by greedy capitalists who did little to help the market with their second-layer or ghost chains.

The requirement of an exchange will forever prevent crypto from truly being a decentralized currency. The exchanges hold the power and control of who and how they buy and sell crypto. 

Germany and the EU are bringing about more stern KYC regulations for 2025, Kraken as an example chose to push their DE customers onto a thirdparty banking firm. The point isn't whether or not Kraken could have done something better, the point is the users are, and will always be, dependent upon the decisions of the exchanges that they use. 

If there was a way to buy and sell crypto without an exchange, then the crypto universe would truly be decentralized, and a digital currency environment truly controlled by its participants. Is this even possible, what would this look like?

Gox.

In this setup, I could use two randomly generated emails exclusively for security, with randomized, long passwords. These emails would serve as recovery for each other, with added security like a hardware key (e.g., YubiKey).

For my Coinbase account, I might use an extremely strong password and require a security key for access. To further secure the assets, I could set up a vault with a withdrawal delay and whitelist addresses to give me time to react to any suspicious activity.

For redundancy, I might manage passwords using physical pieces of paper and store duplicate security keys in separate bank safety deposit boxes.

Would this approach be robust enough for protecting my crypto assets, or are there any potential vulnerabilities or improvements that I should consider?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Detailed Market Analysis - Why we will likely see a major flash crash the next days and how to avoid panic,2024-10-05 18:47:39,"
Hi all, 

I did take my time reading through the rules of this subreddit, and concluded that this would be a welcome post for the group here. 

I am an individual that has been fixated on analyzing and understanding Bitcoin over the last 6-7 years now. My track record has included suggesting a buy zone / long entry at 16,500 December 2022, with a target price of 65,000. As you can imagine at that time, I was laughed at quite a bit, considering at that point in time Bitcoin had broken and retested a major Bearish Pennant pattern on the daily time frame. 

I’ve come to learn that Bitcoin moves by not only liquidity, but specifically liquidity from stop loss orders - due to the dominance of high leverage usage on the exchange platforms people trade futures on. 

I have laid out my anticipated scenario here for you in a very clean chart. The flash crash scenario moves as follows; 

1) 62,200 to 35,000

2) 35,000 slight retracement up to 43,000 zone 

3) 43,000 to 7,000 - 10,000

This however is not a DOOM scenario for Bitcoin, it would be a liquidity sweep prior to a Bull Market on BTC / equities spanning out 1-2 years and likely resulting in a 120k to 240k BTC value. 

While many argue that a black swan event is required to move the market in such an extreme manner, I disagree. 

I propose to you that crypto is the trading market that deviates from the logical restrictions we give to price flexibility in Equities and Forex markets. Crypto is (A) a weekend operated market, (B) price movement is dominated by high leveraged futures positions, and (C) exchanges and market makers benefit directly from traders liquidations and fees paid when opening positions. We can deduce from these three points that there is more interest against traders succeeding by the very platforms they trade on than any other market, and furthermore, an interest in sudden, fast, and extreme movements aimed to liquidate inattentive traders. We can also understand that being a weekend market, untied from the associations to equities and forex hours, it is an animal of its own intentions. Lastly, I will lay out further information in detail about the hidden power of futures stop losses driving the price of Bitcoin in fast and extreme movements, which is the mechanic I propose makes this trade possible and DOES NOT rely on any sort of black swan event to occur. 

I’ve spent a lot of time on this theory, and while I can write and write essays in this post, I will update in the comments as we progress as well as answer any questions. 

Understand this is not a matter of having a dislike for Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, I truly have no emotional attachment to what I trade. I am of the opinion that the liquid value of Bitcoin has no strong correlation to its value as a technology and its function as an asset. If this was to occur, I foresee it happening very quickly, and equally quickly returning to its $50,000 + price and climbing over the next years to upwards of $150k. 

I’d like to encourage keeping comments and discussion on the basis of respect of understanding price movement of Bitcoin (and relatively all cryptocurrencies) - and refrain from making this a personalized discussion of taking any sides. In other words, I am an analyst interested in price movement. Price moves up and down always, not one or the other. 

The last information I will leave on the main post is a summary of how I have come to understanding and trading Bitcoin over the last 6 years of trial and experimenting. 

Here are key points of the way I approach Bitcoin, that I feel are unique and worth mentioning. 

1. The vast majority of bitcoins movement is caused by stop loss orders cascading one into the next, and performing pre-determined chain reactions as they are filled. The market is dominated by futures trading; and this has a major effect on the spot price of Bitcoin. A trader using $100 for a long at 100x is leaving in the form of his stop loss; a $10,000 limit sell order that fills ONLY if price crosses over / below. Unique to limit orders that fill automatically if price is at a premium or discount, stop losses stay in tact until price passes them. Retail traders and those placing orders are only crawling the market along until it begins hitting those stop losses. That’s why bitcoin volatility comes at odd times - the reality is, it’s not caused by human engagement. It’s caused by the decisions traders have made in the past. 

2. Exchanges and market makers profit off of liquidation fees and interest on leverage. Stop loss placement is protected information for a reason; the exchanges and market markets communicate this information, to allow themselves to benefit and you to commit more money to the market. 

3. The Bitcoin chart works on trendlines that cut through - this is often when we see as price consolidation. Bitcoin easily weaves inside and outside of these trendlines due to stop losses sending price to fill the order chains. The invalidations are simply a phenomenon of futures trading prominence. Eventually, one side catches just like a normal trendline - in an abnormal relationship because price is never neatly contained inside or outside - that’s what makes bitcoin prediction so difficult. 

4. DXY is still the best predictor of Bitcoin volatility and as to which direction listed in point 3 will execute. Especially when DXY is approaching a major pivot or direction change, Bitcoin reacts very well with moves to liquidate the opposite side before DXY has a lengthy downward or upward movement (Bitcoin generally moves in opposition).

5. Market manipulation is subtle and occurs with consolidation. Price is contained and controlled, by MM placing counter orders to balance the price moving too far into a particular direction. The consolidation periods attract futures positions for their stop loss orders - and that’s the function that makes moving Bitcoin in the favour of the exchanges / MM in a way that benefits them and also in a way that’s legitimate - as it’s in fact caused by traders own choices. The counter balancing / controlled consolidation is a practice that on paper “prevents manipulation” and “increases liquidity to reduce volatility”. Quite clever. 

6. Since stop loss orders are limits placed in the chart that don’t fill automatically if price is above or below - we can analyze the open gaps on the chart along with consolidation periods to develop a good sense of the stop loss orders in the chart and where price is likely to move. 

7. Stop Loss orders helps us to predict not only direction, but also the speed and distance Bitcoin will move. The more stop losses; the greater the speed of the compounding movement and cascading effects. The longer the consolidation periods, and the larger the gaps are that price has not recovered; the more stop losses are in place. In other words, the movement of Bitcoin is predetermined and thought of like a chain of explosives that are fused together. As soon as that first stop loss triggers, the more exponentially the speed increases as the orders are already in place - and hence why we see many large wicks in Bitcoin. 

8. The fiat conversion of Bitcoin is very fluid and not a firm metric for Bitcoins health. Liquidity can move in and out of the balloon of Bitcoin extremely fast. The finite quantity of Bitcoin and its scarcity and quantity, is not relative to the fiat conversion. One bitcoin is one bitcoin - whether it is at $10 or $100,000. The fiat evaluation of Bitcoin is more-so determined by the “online casino” of sorts that takes place inside the container of Bitcoin; giving us a volatile, moving fiat conversion that ultimately is not relative to the value of Bitcoin as it’s own entity - it’s only relative if Bitcoin is converted back into fiat.

9. There are several hard limitations that stock and equities share that Bitcoin does not. Company share values are limited by the anchors they have in the real world - IE employees and wages, product sales, infrastructure, supply / demand. The evaluation of these companies is not nearly as fluid as Bitcoin for these reasons. The companies are directly related and tied to the system of the economy. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have these reality anchors that provide floors and ceilings to price movement. 

10. There is a degree of human intentionality behind Bitcoins chart and movement. In other words, more so than any other asset, its price projection is planned by human design. The market is funded upon liquidity from retail traders, predominantly in futures markets. The business of exchange leveraging is astronomical, and Market Makers control the great majority of liquidity via their automated systems and order placement services. Join that information with the profit structure and beneficiaries of our liquidations; and we can base a logical conclusion that there is a sole vested interest in the way Bitcoin’s price moves. That is; in favour of liquidating the common Joe and Jane. This allows us a unique advantage to be able to strategize with a business-focused mindset, more so that any other asset class. This is largely due to the lack of regulations and available information with international crypto exchange platforms and Market Makers.

Point is, I want my theory approved/disproved:
There are locations in my country where heat is not working during winter and it has become an reality and also a joke that students just leave their computers open 24/7 to mine crypto and to also generate some heat.

Let's say that the said energy is free (the student dorms are paid for the living, but not for the electricity), wouldn't it be a good strategy to grab any computer you have with a mediocre GPU, let it mine 24/7, make some amount of money, and with it later buy performant GPU's for mining, having a source of money that covers a little of the rent + the lacking heat?

(Ofc, I want more critic about the mining with mediocre GPU's part)

And the thing is I don't know how many are there providers, and which ones can help me because there are few things to mention:
-I'm in EU
-I just moved to a country that is a part of EEA, so if I need to go through verification process, I can do it o ly w my residence permit, but I also got a government document saying where I'm staying
-I'd like to have as less fees on withdrawal as possible. Nobody likes to pay country taxes for some extra hard working $, yet alone see that $ getting swallowed by some extra fees.

What I've tried but didn't work:
Coinbase, ByBit, Kucoin, Binance.. (maybe I could get kucoin to work but there are no infos avout fees on their app)

What Ive tried but could work:
Bitpanda, crypto.com, and maybe few others, I'm not sure.
Although I'm sceptic about crypto, since I need to get coins in order to get a better card, and I really don't have any extra $ to throw for that.

Could it cause panic selling, destabilize the market, or have other unforeseen consequences? I'd love to hear people's thoughts on this intriguing possibility.""",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Mcap per node: valid valuation/decentralization measure?,2024-10-03 15:25:48,"I was toying around with finding how much the market values each node of a decentralized network...

Only considering ""relay"" like nodes, not validators.

To me, having Mcap/node > Bitcoin's means your network could be overvalued given current centralization/lack of decentralization. It could also mean that the market is pricing in future benefit/utility provided by a network despite its current lack of decentralization. Any of these networks could become more decentralized going forward, I'm not trying to knock them, although BNB is a bit concerning to me lol.

\*Note: Solana numbers are from 2023, I could not find anything more current. I had to subtract consensus nodes from total nodes to derive the number of rpc nodes.

I could not find node counts for TON, ADA, AVAX, or LINK taht did not include validator counts, if anyone can point me to that information I would appreciate the help!

Assuming that he is alive it can be assumed that he may post comments from time to time. 

I personally think that he is an individual who has extra time on his hands. He most likely is wealthy so he does not need his bitcoin. 

It’s my hope that Mr. Satoshi has found a place where he is happy. 

I also believe that he has registered for another email address because the one at GMX probably has been spammed alot. 

I hope that he has been living a good life away from all the drama and negativity that some people have. 

I hope that he is able to work somewhere in the industry. If he reveals his fine most likely can get a job with any cryptocurrency company but right now he can’t put it on his resume and if he does he will probably not get hired.

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

I am working on a lattice system based on the ISIS problem. ChatGPT keeps thinking this is a terrorist form of cryptography, but it's just inhomogeneous short integer solution.  With that out the way, I'm wondering about short secret generation. I've become partial to using a Gaussian distribution to sample from a set of integers. It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations?

  They prefer vector computers with a single large memory over (new at the time) MPP machines with thousands of processors and distributed memory.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past.

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

I also learned about Shor's algorithm, and cryptology in the post-quantum world.

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify.

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Thank you for your time, and happy Meshing!",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-10-06 00:55:30.754863

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?
