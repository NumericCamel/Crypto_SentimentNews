This remarkable price movement has garnered the attention of many analysts as investors continue to project the trajectory of the price. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend There are basically two ways the XRP price can go from here: either a continued move upwards or a notable correction. An in-between is a consolidation pattern. CrediBULL Crypto shared his insights on the potential paths the altcoin might take next. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, he highlighted two scenarios that could shape XRP’s near-term future. What’s The Next Path For XRP Price? According to CrediBULL Crypto, XRP’s recent rally exhibits a textbook example of a five-wave impulsive move, complete with clearly identifiable subwaves. This pattern confirms that the cryptocurrency has likely reached its absolute bottom at the November low of $0.49, which is a strong foundation for its current upward trend. The impulsive wave structure suggests that the crypto is at a pivotal juncture, and its future trajectory hinges on whether it sustains specific price levels. The first possibility centers on XRP failing to maintain its position above $1.05, which is the origin of the fifth subwave in the current impulsive structure. Should this level break, it would confirm that the XRP price is in a larger Wave 2 correction. According to the Elliot Waves Theory, Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves, while Waves 1, 3, and 5 are the main bullish waves. before This correction, while bearish in the short term, would lay the groundwork for an even stronger Wave 3 rally in the future. CrediBULL Crypto predicts a very different outcome if the XRP price manages to hold above the $1.05 level. Holding above the $1.05 level would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending. In this case, the analyst predicted that the XRP price will surpass the $2 mark before experiencing any substantial pullback.   The Road Ahead For XRP XRP, which had lingered below the $1 threshold for the past three years, has now firmly established itself above this pivotal mark. The recent XRP price surge to $1.6 suggests that the cryptocurrency is in a stronger position to target the $2 milestone rather than retreat into a significant correction. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by speculation around SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s anticipated resignation in January 2025.

Nonetheless, the next phase of its journey depends on key support and resistance levels.

The price has skyrocketed by an astonishing 225% in under three weeks, showing no signs of slowing down as momentum builds. This surge has positioned it as a top-performing altcoin, capturing the attention of analysts and traders alike. Related Reading: Avalanche Soars 20% In 24 Hours – Analyst Reveals Next Price Target CrediBull, a prominent analyst on X, has shared a detailed technical analysis highlighting XRP’s strong bullish structure. According to his insights, XRP is currently in a well-defined 5-wave impulsive move, a pattern often associated with sustained upward trends. If it continues to hold a critical support level, CrediBull predicts that the price could soar past $2 in the coming weeks, marking a significant milestone for the altcoin. As excitement grows, market participants are closely watching its performance. The ongoing rally suggests that XRP could hit new highs and pave the way for broader altcoin gains. Whether it can maintain its upward trajectory will depend on its ability to sustain key support levels and capitalize on the current bullish sentiment. For now, XRP remains a focal point in the market, with its next moves eagerly anticipated. The Bullish Rally Could Continue  The recent bullish phase for XRP might be just the beginning as optimism continues to build among analysts who foresee a higher price in the months ahead. However, key price levels must be tested and maintained for XRP to sustain its momentum and advance to the next leg up. Prominent analyst CrediBull shared his insights on X, revealing that XRP is currently in a clear 5-wave impulsive move, a strong indicator of a bullish trend. According to his technical analysis, this pattern confirms that XRP’s absolute bottom was established at $0.49 earlier this year. He also emphasized the importance of the $1.05 level, the origin of the fifth subwave in this impulsive structure. CrediBull explained that if XRP falls below $1.05, it could signal the start of a larger Wave 2 correction, which would likely precede the next major upward impulse (Wave 3). However, if XRP holds firmly above $1.05, it would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending, potentially pushing the price to $2 or higher before any significant pullback occurs. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour This analysis reinforces the view that XRP’s current rally may just be the start of a broader bullish trend. Investors are now watching closely to see if XRP can maintain key support levels and confirm its extended move upward. XRP Hits Multi-Year Highs: ATH Next? XRP is trading at $1.45, following an impressive rally that saw the price touch $1.63 yesterday, marking its highest level since May 2021. This milestone has sparked optimism among investors, positioning XRP for a potential run to new all-time highs in the coming months. The sustained upward momentum reflects growing confidence in the price’s bullish trajectory. However, the recent surge also brings the possibility of consolidation. The price might need to cool off and gather strength below the $1.63 mark before continuing its upward movement. Consolidation phases are a natural part of any significant rally and can help establish stronger support levels for future price action.

Analysts believe that maintaining this level would be a strong signal of market confidence, paving the way for XRP to build on its recent gains and target new milestones.

And while Bitcoin and other altcoins started to rally immediately after Trump’s election, XRP’s price movement remained sluggish. Only a few days ago, XRP’s price began to move before breaking the $1 level on November 16th. The previous time Ripple’s XRP held the price was in December 2021, when it dipped to $1.96.

While the momentum on the Telegram-based cryptocurrency has cooled in the last few hours, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez anticipates further price gains as shown by a recent bullish prediction. Related Reading: Notcoin Set For More Gains Following 13% Price Rally – Details Notcoin Preparing For Liftoff: Analyst  In an X post on November 23, Martinez gave a reassuring bullish prediction on Notcoin following the token’s sideways movement after breaking out of a falling wedge two weeks ago.  Traditionally, the falling wedge is a bullish pattern characterized by two downward trend lines converging as the price moves lower. When a descending wedge is observed after a downtrend, it signals a potential reversal to an uptrend but if this chart pattern forms during an uptrend, it indicates merely a pause before the price rise continues. Notcoin gained by over 380% following its launch in May, but soon slipped in a bearish market that stretched over the following five months. On November 9, Martinez stated the altcoin had broken out of a falling wedge pattern setting up a potential 76% price gain.  However, Notcoin has remained in a range-bound market over the past two weeks oscillating between $0.0070 – $0.0084. Commenting on this development, Ali Martinez remains confident of his bullish prediction stating that the altcoin is only gathering the necessary momentum and liquidity to launch a price upswing. The analyst’s price target remains $0.12 which will represent the token’s highest price level since August if attained.     Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Telegram-Based Notcoin Is Ready To Fly, Here’s How High Major Resistance Awaits NOT Bullish Rally Amidst possibilities of a major price surge, investors should note that Notcoin will face a resistance zone at $0.010 which proved previously effective with a price rejection in October. However, Martinez’s positive projection remains highly possible considering the current robust bullish sentiments in the Notcoin market and general crypto community.  The digital asset market has been on the green side following the election of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump as US President. With the anticipation of a crypto-friendly administration, investors are likely to retain buying pressure in major cryptocurrencies including Notcoin. Moreover, Notcoin continues to secure strategic partnerships that can increase its adoption levels. These include its recent Telegram Gaming Accelerator launched in collaboration with Helika Gaming. At the time of writing, NOT trades at $0.0081 reflecting gains of 4.36% and 5.66%  in the past seven and thirty days respectively. In addition, altcoin’s daily trading volume is up by 138.51% and valued at $362.69 million. Featured image from Happycoin.club, chart from Tradingview",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bullish Signs For Cardano: Expert Forecasts $6 Price Target As Buying Pressure Grows,2024-11-24 18:00:20+00:00,"Cardano (ADA), currently ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency, has emerged as one of the market’s top performers. It has experienced an impressive 108% increase over the past two weeks, propelled its price to a 32-month high, fueled by a wave of bullish sentiment following Donald Trump’s presidential victory on November 5. Potential For Cardano To Reach New All-Time Highs Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted ADA’s massive performance in a post on X (formerly Twitter), noting that the cryptocurrency has surged nearly 200% in the last three weeks. Despite this significant increase, Martinez suggests that even greater gains may be on the horizon. In his analysis, Martinez pointed out that whales and institutional investors strategically positioned themselves for future price movements. He reported that the volume of large transactions on the Cardano network has surpassed $22 billion daily, indicating a high accumulation level among significant holders.  Notably, whales—individuals or entities holding between $1 million and $10 million in ADA—have increased their positions by over 100% in the past month, signaling confidence in Cardano’s potential. Related Reading: XRP Price Outlook Brightens: Expert Predicts $2 Target Post-Gensler Era Martinez further elaborated on ADA’s price action, suggesting that the ongoing buying pressure mirrors patterns observed in previous bullish cycles. He posits that if this trend continues, Cardano’s price could target the $6 mark, which would nearly double its all-time high of $3.09 reached during the 2021 bull run.  Such a price increase would represent a staggering 461% surge from its current levels. Yet, for this bullish thesis to hold, Martinez emphasizes the importance of $0.80 support.  The analyst notes that approximately 48,000 ADA addresses purchased nearly 1.20 billion coins at this price point, which may provide a solid foundation for future growth.  Previously, Martinez predicted that if history repeats itself, the Cardano price could see a market top by September 2025, suggesting 10 months of what could be one of the biggest gains not only for ADA but for the broader crypto market. ADA Price Targets $1.25 Resistance Level Further supporting Martinez’s bullish predictions, other analysts have weighed in on Cardano’s (ADA) recent performance. Rekt Capital has noted a “phenomenal run” for ADA, indicating that the cryptocurrency has confirmed a new macro uptrend.  Rekt highlighted that the last time ADA broke through the $0.72 level, the price subsequently rallied to its $3 record peak, suggesting a similar potential for future growth. Related Reading: Ethereum Attempts Key Breakout: Analysts Set Next Target As ETH Reclaims $3,200 Another analyst, known as Sssebi, shared his insights predicting that once ADA surpasses the $1.60 mark, it could experience a swift ascent to $2.40.

The Ethereum layer-2 token hovers above $2.20 with investors strongly bullish on future price gains. However, certain trading indicators signal otherwise. Related Reading: Optimism: Major Partnership Pushes OP Price By 24% Optimism Likely To Fall By 18% In a November 23 post on X, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a bearish prediction on Optimism despite the token’s current upward trend.  According to Martinez, the TD Sequential has flashed a sell signal on OP’s 4-hour trading chart, presenting the potential for an imminent price dip. In trading markets, the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator is commonly used to identify potential price exhaustion or continuations by analyzing patterns within price bars. After OP’s rally in the past week, the TD sequential now points to a trend exhaustion, suggesting a possible price reversal. Following this signal development, Martinez predicts OP could slide to $2.0. However, further correction could force the token’s price to around $1.80 indicating a potential 18% decline from the current market price. Martinez’s price projection is further backed by OP’s Relative Strength Index, an indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of an asset’s price movement to determine if it is overbought or oversold. According to data from OP’s 4-hour trading chart, the token’s RSI valued at 65.18 and descending from the overbought zone indicates buying pressure is weakening and a potential price correction is imminent.  However, Optimism remains well above its 100-day simple moving average (SMA) which suggests a possible uptrend continuation.  This factor, combined with the present strong bullish sentiments in the altcoin market suggests OP may maintain its current price rally, reaching as high as $2.5 at which lies its next significant market resistance. Related Reading: Optimism Superchain’s L2 Mode Network Launches New Governance Model – Here’s Why Optimism Price Overview  At press time, Optimism exchanges hand at $2.29 following a 1.64% gain in the past 24 hours.

On larger time frames, OP is significantly impressive notching gains of 35.76% in seven days as earlier stated, and 33.77% in the past 30 days. Despite recent gains, the Ethereum-layer 2 token remains 54.65% away from its all-time high of $4.85. However, OP remains an investor favorite considering its status in the Ethereum ecosystem. According to data from Top 7 ICO, Optimism is the Ethereum layer-2 network with the third largest total value locked (TVL) valued at $6.46 billion falling behind Base ($7.02 billion) and Arbitrum ($14.3 billion).

However, the cryptocurrency products ended the week on a high with a substantial capital influx on Friday, November 22. This capital inflow represents a shift in investor sentiment, which has not particularly been positive over the past few days. Nonetheless, the market would be hoping that this newly found momentum would persist and perhaps also trigger some bullish action for the ETH price. Can Ethereum ETFs Ensure ETH’s Price Recovery? According to the latest data from SoSoValue, the United States-based spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $91.21 million on Friday. This positive single-day performance represents the first net inflow for the exchange-traded funds since November 13. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Jump To $99,000, But His Prediction Is Not Done Market data shows that a significant portion of the inflows came from BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (with the ticker ETHA). The crypto product registered around $99.7 million in total daily inflows to close the previous week. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (with the ticker FETH) and Bitwise’s Ether ETF (ETHW) were the only other products to post capital inflows on Friday, recording $5.76 million and $4.96 million, respectively. Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH registered outflows of over $18.5 million and $621,000, respectively. As earlier mentioned, Friday’s performance represents a return to positive inflows for the Ethereum ETFs. Prior to this showing, the crypto products posted six consecutive outflow days, draining a cumulative total of $225.6 million within this period. The price of ETH, which initially seemed to have found its footing, also slowed down during this period of the Ethereum ETFs outflow. This trend highlights the significant influence of the exchange-traded funds on price action — both for the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the fortunes of the US-based Ethereum ETFs seemingly turning around, the price of ETH has also taken an upward swing in the last couple of days. Investors will be hoping that the positive momentum for the Ethereum ETFs continues and translates into the altcoin’s price. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $3,423, reflecting a 2.1% increase in the past day. The altcoin is up by more than 9% on the weekly timeframe, according to data from CoinGecko. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern, Is The Top Only 2 Weeks Away After Hitting $100,000?

However, investors appear to be undeterred by the sluggish price action of the premier cryptocurrency in the past few days. Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Is Rising — Impact On Price In a November 23 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that traders have taken to loading their bags with Bitcoin in recent days. This on-chain observation is based on the “taker buy/sell ratio,” which tracks the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency. A greater-than-one value of the taker buy/sell ratio suggests that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This is usually considered a bullish signal, which suggests the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case).

Typically, this indicates a bearish sentiment amongst investors, as the selling pressure is overshadowing the buying pressure in the specific market. Martinez highlighted in his post on X that the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio across major trading platforms, including Binance, OKX, HTX, and Bybit, has witnessed a significant surge in the past day. As shown in the chart below, the metric spiked to a value of over 28 on Binance, the world’s largest exchange. Similarly, the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio climbed well above the 1 threshold, showing the mounting buying pressure in the open market. This level of intense buying activity could ensure that the premier cryptocurrency continues its rally toward the $100,000 milestone. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $97,800, reflecting a 1.1% decline in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, the flagship cryptocurrency’s performance on the weekly timeframe is still impressive. According to CoinGecko data, BTC is up by nearly 8% in the past week. Who Is Buying?  In another post on the X platform, Martinez revealed that a notable cohort of large investors (also known as whales) have been active in the Bitcoin market in the past few days. This class of whales involved here are those holding between 100 and 1,000 coins. According to data from Santiment, whales have purchased more than 40,000 BTC (equivalent to around $3.96 billion) in the past four days. Considering their influence on market dynamics, this buying activity from the Bitcoin whales could be bullish for price.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin ATH Incoming? Analyst Issues 2-Day Price Forecast,2024-11-24 10:00:52+00:00,"Crypto analyst Master Kenobi has made a bold two-day prediction for the Dogecoin price, stating that it will hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the next two days. The analyst highlighted Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which he suggested is very bullish for the meme coin at the moment.  Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough Dogecoin Price To Reach ATH In Two Days In an X post, Master Kenobi predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach a new ATH in two days. The analyst stated that Dogecoin’s 4-hour RSI chart appears to confirm his fractal setup. Based on this, he remarked that the leg up could potentially reach $0.85 by November 25th, marking a new ATH for the foremost meme coin.  Master Kenobi added that some might even identify a potential bullish divergence within the RSI chart. Such a pattern also presents a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, indicating that the meme coin is set to witness a bullish reversal to the upside. This bullish reversal is already happening, as DOGE has successfully broken above $0.4.  It is worth mentioning that crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted a bullish divergence on the 4-hour RSI chart. The analyst noted that this signal indicates an uptrend continuation in the Dogecoin price movement. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach $0.7 on its next leg up. This will bring the meme coin close to its ATH of $0.73.  Meanwhile, even if the Dogecoin price doesn’t hit a new ATH by November 25, another of Master Kebobi’s analyses shows that it could happen by December 2. The analyst had previously highlighted a 91-day sequence, which he said Dogecoin is about to complete and suggested would lead to a price rally to $1 by December 2.  The Next Resistance Level To Watch Out For  With the Dogecoin price successfully breaking above $0.4, crypto analyst Kevin Capital has provided insights into the next resistance level to watch out for. In an X post, he noted that Dogecoin is breaking out of the macro .786 Fib level. He added that the next resistance is $0.54, followed by the meme coin’s current ATH at $0.73.   Crypto analyst Javon Marks also confirmed that a rally to the current ATH for the Dogecoin price was in sight. In an X post, he said Dogecoin was surging towards $0.6533 and could break out of that level once it reached the target. He added that this 52.2% price surge to $0.6533 could happen quickly and that a rally to $1.25 comes into play once that happens.  Related Reading: Chinese Court Declares Personal Crypto Ownership Legal In Mainland China At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.46, up over 16% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Reddit, chart from TradingView",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Rally Benefits From US Buyers – Coinbase Premium Gap Reveals Strong Demand,2024-11-24 08:30:10+00:00,"Bitcoin has surged past the $99,800 mark, setting another all-time high as it inches closer to the psychological $100,000 milestone. Despite briefly testing the level, BTC has yet to break through, leaving investors and analysts eagerly anticipating the next move. With demand remaining robust, the stage appears set for Bitcoin to push past this key barrier in the coming days. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume Hits $1.683B In One Hour Recent data from CryptoQuant highlights a significant factor driving this rally: the Coinbase Premium Gap, which currently sits at $224. This metric, representing the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges, signals strong buying activity from US Coinbase investors.  The relentless upward momentum has further solidified Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market, with many viewing the $100,000 level as a critical supply zone. While the price has yet to break through, the ongoing rally reflects a growing belief that Bitcoin’s parabolic bull phase is far from over. As the market approaches this pivotal moment, all eyes remain on BTC’s ability to sustain its momentum and claim new highs, setting the tone for the weeks ahead. Bitcoin Price Action Remains Strong Bitcoin has been in an “only up” phase since November 5, showing no signs of weakness as it consistently climbs to new heights. Even after failing to break above the $100,000 mark yesterday, price action remains incredibly strong. Bulls are firmly in control, and if Bitcoin holds above critical demand levels, the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone could be breached within hours. CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn revealed that robust demand from US investors is a key driving force behind this rally. According to his data, the Coinbase Premium Gap—a metric that tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges—stands at $224.  This positive premium underscores US-based buying activity as a significant factor in the current bullish momentum. A high premium often suggests that investors on Coinbase are willing to pay a higher price than others, a strong indicator of heightened demand. Related Reading: Polkadot Holds Key Demand Level – DOT Could Hit $11 In Coming Weeks As the market watches closely, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its upward trajectory hinges on staying above vital support levels. The psychological resistance at $100,000 remains formidable, but the unyielding appetite from US investors points to continued strength in the days ahead. With such solid fundamentals, many analysts believe Bitcoin is poised for another explosive rally once the $100,000 barrier is decisively cleared. BTC Rally Is Only Starting Bitcoin is trading at $98,800 after a failed breakout above the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. Despite this temporary setback, price action remains firmly bullish as BTC continues to hold above key demand levels, showing resilience and strength in the current market. The failure to retrace to lower prices indicates that bullish momentum is still intact, keeping investors optimistic about a potential breakthrough. If BTC maintains its position above the critical $95,000 support level, the likelihood of a surge past the $100,000 psychological barrier increases significantly. Holding above this level would signal strong buyer interest and the potential for further upside, paving the way for Bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Charts Signal Potential Breakout However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $95,000, a retrace to lower demand zones would confirm a short-term correction. Such a pullback could provide the necessary fuel for the next rally, as it would allow the market to consolidate before making another attempt at breaking the $100,000 mark. For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s ability to defend its key support levels as the market anticipates the next major move in this historic rally.

Reddit,solana,What is your profit-taking plan? Here is a tool that will tell you what it should be,2024-11-24 17:26:22,"Hey everyone!

I'm super excited to finally share a personal project that's been in the works for over 6 months. As I prepared myself for the upcoming (inevitable) bull run, I wanted to figure out the best way to take profits. I'm not interested in selling all my holdings, nor do I want to DCA out. While DCA works okay, it doesn't quite capture my specific wants and needs.

That's why I created [kollit.ai](https://kollit.ai). It's a (free with paid options) tool that helps you craft your perfect profit-taking (and market entry) strategy, based on **your** market outlook and predictions.

So, how does it work? It minimizes ""regret""—both the regret of action (""Fuck, I shouldn't have sold at that price"") and the regret of inaction (""Should've sold when I had the chance""). My algorithm balances these two regrets to output a strategy that fits you perfectly.

Getting started is easy:

* Enter **5 price points** for each asset you want a strategy for.
* Play around with a few parameters like **risk tolerance** and **execution pace**.
* And you're all set!

I'm just wrapping up the closed alpha stage and opening registration to everyone. For now, I'm allowing a few dozen people each day to keep things smooth and make sure everything works.

I'm also thrilled to introduce a new feature that wasn't in the alpha—**Wisdom of the Crowd**. When an asset has over 100 active predictions, you can harness the collective insights to give your strategy an extra boost!

As a launch promotion, every new user gets **12 extra free tokens** \+ **1 token for each month** they log in :)

I'm a solo dev and poured my heart into this, using every spare moment I had. Maintaining this project costs over $60 a month (thanks to machine learning and all the calculations), so if you like what you see, I'd really appreciate it if you'd consider buying a token package :)

Reddit,solana,Some tips for beginners on memecoins.,2024-11-23 17:38:28,"I'm from ETH, I've been full time shitcoiner for 4 years now, and contrary to what some people say memecoins are NOT pure gambling and they're probably not as scammy as you think. 

However, SOL is mostly luck.  ETH was probably 70/30 Skill to Luck, while SOL is 70/30 Luck to Skill. It's a zero-sum game, and Devs, KOLs, Snipers, and MEV/bot operators soak up more liquidity than you will. The odds ARE and will continue to be against you--until you progress high enough.


**Anyway here's some shitcoin tips to help you get started:**

1) Learn to read Solscan. Extremely important.

2) Find Alpha Wallets to follow (NOT copytrade)

3) Choose your volatility. Buying pre-bonding and holding to $10M is high-risk, requiring a bankroll to absorb losses before a win. Buying at $500K and holding to $10M is less volatile.

4) Stick to one strategy. Define your MCap range and identify key stats (volume, txns, holders) for tokens in that range. Use charting tools to filter accordingly.

5) Follow callers for insight. You don’t need to buy their picks; use them to gauge market trends.

6) Stay updated on the meta. If you’re unaware of the current meta, avoid trading. SOL's meta shifts within hours or days, unlike ETH’s slower pace.

7) Watch charts without impulsive buying. If you can’t, you're an addict, which is fine most of us are, but know that about yourself.

8) Master the basics: slippage, liquidity, market cap, price, and price impact. 

9) The two ways to find good tokens are social climbing and blockchain tracking. On ETH, blockchain tracking was dominant (75/25), but on SOL, it’s closer to 50/50 due to SOLscan's complexity.

Post any questions here and I'll do my best to answer them.",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

I’ve made my own little coin without the intention of being a scammer and all that, but it’s currently gained almost no attention despite me creating a telegram and working on an x page. 

I’m tried of being rug pulled and catching myself in losing positions and simply have a goal of creating an actual community around a coin that could be mildly successful for anyone involved. 

So my question is how do I build a solid community? 

Ive been shilling online with X and I’m not sure that was the best approach because all I have is people DM’ing me with offers to promote my coin for obscene amounts of money and I genuinely want to work with people that just want to work on building a community and growing the coin. 

Can anyone offer me some advice?

Reddit,solana,“Nothing” – The Crypt0 with No Purpose That Reached a $20M Market Cap in One Month,2024-11-24 18:02:25,"
Have you heard of Nothing? Probably not, because, as the name suggests, there’s nothing defining it. But curiously, it’s become one of the most mysterious and intriguing projects in the crypto world.

This anonymous cryptocurrency, launched just a month and a half ago, is driven by shl0ms, an abstract artist whose only “vision” is, well, nothing. Its whitepaper contains just one word: nothing. No team, no roadmap, no product. Just nothing. Yet, surprisingly, the community has been drawn to this blank concept.

The project kicked off with €250,000 spent on a Lamborghini, which was then destroyed and split into 999 NFTs—a stunt that raised around $1M in transactions. The initial idea was to sell the 999 parts of the destroyed car as NFTs to generate revenue. But that was just a moment in time, an act that cemented the abstract, conceptual nature of the creator. The true essence of the project has nothing to do with traditional marketing or promises—it’s about absolute emptiness.

What’s most surprising is that, despite having no clear purpose, the cryptocurrency has surged to a $20M market cap in just one month. How? No one knows. But it seems that the mystery, and the pure irrelevance of “nothing,” has captured an unexpected appeal.

The question is: Can a coin with no purpose continue to grow, or is it just another bubble waiting to pop? One thing is clear—it challenges the traditional concepts of what a cryptocurrency really needs to be successful.

What do you think? Is Nothing an abstract work of art or just the latest attempt to create something in the crypto space that makes no sense?

From there I placed 1B of the 10B minted in the pool and set the base pair to SOL.

Is there a good way to enable multiple pools out do most tokens focus on that one? If so, what is the most common way to distribute the tokens between them?

Also, most of the YT videos I saw suggested that for MEME style tokens as this one is, you usually put 90% into the pool to start with or more. I also saw someone burn the liquidity tokens, but I didn’t see those site up in my wallet and wasn’t sure of I missed a step.

Reddit,solana,What's the best approach for staking SOL? ,2024-11-24 13:00:09,"I've been holding SOL for a while, and even though I was tempted to sell a few times in the past I'm glad I decided against it.Obviously because of the positive momentum right now, holding it all this time was a good decision in hindsight.   
  
That said, I'd still like to hold, for a while at least, and at the moment, I don't want to just leave it sitting idle. I'd consider trading it, but to be honest, I have no idea what the play is with SOLANA and I don't want to lose what I already have.   
  
I decided staking might be a good option, but currently the only option that looks good is the one my exchange is offering. From what I've seen converting SOL to BGSOL allows me stake SOL while maintaining liquidity to reinvest or even trade if I want to.  
  
I also found that this is not a new process and other exchanges have something similar, although their APR is a lot lower, and that's why I chose Bitget in the first place to be honest.   
  
Call it greed, but I noticed that there's even an additional APR for the second round of staking as well as other incentives which I understand is just a way of keeping users on their platform.   
  
Personally I play the numbers game and I'd go for the option with the most return and security, so I'd actually appreciate any option currently higher than the one on Bitget if there is.",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

Reddit,solana,My current set up to track profitable addresses and their strategies ,2024-11-24 02:59:04,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been refining my process for finding profitable opportunities in the Solana ecosystem, and I thought I’d share my current workflow. It’s a combination of tools that’s been working well for me, and I’d love to hear how others are doing it or if there are better strategies out there.

**My Workflow**

1. [**Pump.fun**](http://Pump.fun) **for Token Discovery:**

I start by looking at new token creators on [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), especially those generating a lot of buzz or activity.

2. **DEX Screener for Top Traders:**

Once I’ve found interesting tokens, I check out DEX Screener to see which wallets are top traders (Based on P&L). I focus on wallets that are consistently making smart moves—this has been a key step in finding good leads. (this is the hardest part)

3. **Address Monitor for Tracking:**

After identifying promising wallets, I plug them into a telegram bot to track their activity. This bot gives me notifications real time on what the address is doing.

You could also plug in there photon if you are willing to 100% copy trade this guys.

This combination of tools helps me focus on wallets with a track record of profitable trades and gives me real-time insights into their activity. It’s not perfect, but it’s helped me make better decisions and avoid FOMO-driven mistakes.

What tools or workflows do you use to track profitable strategies? I’m always looking to improve and would love to hear about setups that have worked well for others.",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

For example, Ray Bot, I get that is a wallet tracker but where do you get the wallets you want to track? The good ones or at least the whales.

  
Second example would be like a discord server where some people share with each other knowledge about specific coins and calls. Even if these servers are paid, because essentially it's a tool, right? I'm sure there are a lot more tools that I don't know about.

So if anyone can share what are some tools like I mentioned before that would help me and help other people maybe in this post, it would be amazing and very much appreciated.

Reddit,ethereum,What Problem Does Ethereum Solve 2024 Edition,2024-11-24 17:28:17,"I've been following this space for about 9 years.

Enough that I threw in some dollars and kind of just never let my ETH's go since 2016, a small DCA and then discipline to forget about it. I remember at some point ETH2 really sketched me out, and at one point I was nose keep in the literature and really understood the mechanics of it. Because of ETH, I am independently wealthy and pursue my career/passions without restrictions. My family is forever thankful for buying into the *Vision* of ETH.

Grown up the last 9 years, and am super thankful for learning about these communities early in my life. But I have also lived in the real world, work in technology / cybersecurity, even employed at a fintech company that implemented a crypto currency adjacent technology for ledger tracking and tokenization enabled workloads - but it was 100% isolated, private, and used by the company - for the company - built on top of a fork of a now popular cryptocurrency.

From a real world applied problem solving standpoint, I'm not stuck on either of the following questions - independently, I have strong answers. But together, I simply don't.

Which leads me to the following:

1. What problem does ethereum solve, AND
2. How is solving that problem going to lead to a financial gain or profit in holding ETH

There is the *Vision* of Etherum, and then there is the *Applied* nature of Ethereum in the real world outside of internet forums, discord, trading apps and reddit.

8 years ago, someone asked the question, ""What Problem Does Ethereum Solve"", here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/50mvyx/what\_problem\_or\_need\_does\_ethereum\_really/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/50mvyx/what_problem_or_need_does_ethereum_really/)

Honestly, I don't think the answer in solving these problems leads to ETH becoming more valuable. In fact, I think the opposite is true - the value would either:

have to stabilize and maintain a very low price for adoption , or , the application of ETH would be by private blockchains running completely independently from the main net, and businesses, corporations and government institutions peering and partnering between each other.

Not looking to delve (yes, ChatGPT has taught me new words) into speculation and pricing and current market hysteria. That is for children.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum: The Beautiful Death of Agility,2024-11-24 21:59:52,"*This post is taking part in the Devconflict_x Kiwi writing contest.*

The Ethereum community stands at a crossroads, yet it may not even realize it. Caught in the dazzling momentum of innovation, collaboration, and evolution, we risk forgetting the very foundation upon which this project was built: resilience. In our pursuit of agility, we may lose sight of a truth so fundamental it feels almost sacrilegious to say aloud:

**Ethereum needs to die to truly live.**

Not literally, of course, but in spirit. To fulfill its promise as the ""Internet of Value,"" Ethereum must embrace ossification as its ultimate goal. The base layer should become boring, invisible, and irrelevant to daily conversation—not because it has failed, but because it has succeeded so completely that it no longer requires attention. The irony is sharp: the greatest triumph of a decentralized system is the irrelevance of its community.

**The Case for Ossification**

Imagine a world where no one argues over the TCP/IP stack anymore. Why? Because it works. It's reliable, unchanging, and trusted to the point of invisibility. Ethereum should aspire to this state: a protocol so stable and robust that its functionality is no longer debated, no longer tinkered with, and no longer the subject of headlines. The innovation and experimentation we celebrate today belong elsewhere—to layer 2s, to applications, to higher abstractions that build upon the rock-solid foundation of Ethereum’s base layer.

Ossification isn’t just a technical necessity; it’s a moral imperative. Blockchain technology was born in hostile environments, designed to resist attack and inspire trust. Every change, every EIP, every tweak to the core protocol introduces risk—new surfaces for attack, new opportunities for exploitation. Trust isn’t built on agility. It’s built on stability. Ethereum’s long-term viability depends on its ability to stop changing.

And yet, the community seems hesitant. We cling to our roles as developers, researchers, and moderators. We celebrate the vibrant discourse and constant evolution of the protocol. But this beautiful collaboration, as precious as it is, must eventually end. Not in failure, but in transformation. The Ethereum of the future will thrive not because we’re actively improving it, but because it no longer needs improvement.

**Community and the Fear of Irrelevance**

This transformation requires an existential reckoning for the community. The moderators, developers, and active participants who shape Ethereum today must confront an uncomfortable truth: their work is temporary. Ossification means fewer EIPs, less debate, and, ultimately, a shrinking community. But this isn’t a cause for alarm—it’s a sign of success.

When activity on forums decline, when user engagement wanes, when the vibrant culture around Ethereum fades into the background, we shouldn’t mourn. We should celebrate. These are the growing pains of maturity, the inevitable consequence of becoming “good enough.”

But the current culture resists this idea. Moderators worry about declining engagement. Developers push for agility over stability. The community as a whole clings to its relevance. This resistance isn’t just a barrier to ossification—it’s a denial of Ethereum’s destiny.

**Automating Governance: A Path Forward**

One way to confront this resistance is by leading through example. The Ethereum community, with its emphasis on decentralization and trustless systems, is uniquely positioned to pioneer a new approach to governance—one that relies not on human discretion, but on automation.

Imagine a world where moderation on platforms like Reddit is handled not by humans but by large language models (LLMs). These models, trained on transparent and community-approved guidelines, could analyze every post and comment, assign confidence scores, and act based on predefined thresholds. This system wouldn’t ban users out of emotion or bias but based on clear, consistent criteria. Every action would be explained, every decision traceable. Moderators would shift from enforcers to observers, fine-tuning the system rather than wielding power.

This isn’t just a pipe dream—it’s achievable with today’s technology. Implementing such systems would set a powerful precedent, demonstrating how decentralized, automated governance can outperform traditional, centralized methods. It could serve as a model not just for Ethereum, but for political and social systems worldwide.

**The Death of Agility, the Birth of Trust**

Ossification isn’t the end of Ethereum—it’s the beginning of its true potential. By becoming boring, Ethereum becomes reliable. By fading into the background, it becomes indispensable. And by embracing its own irrelevance, the community ensures that Ethereum’s impact will endure long after the debates have ended and the developers have moved on.

The question isn’t whether Ethereum can remain agile—it’s whether it has the courage to stop. To become boring. To die beautifully, so that the world it supports can thrive.

This isn’t just a technical argument. It’s a call to the soul of the community. Can we let go of what we’ve built so that it can live beyond us? Can we embrace the death of the Ethereum we know, to give birth to the Ethereum the world needs?",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

Reddit,ethereum,"Controlling the fee on Ethereum (Metamask, nodes and Etherscan) is just a nightmare - Is this a bug?",2024-11-22 08:39:51,"I'm not happy with how this went, but I wouldn't call this a rant. Let's call it a description of the nightmare that even someone as techy as a blockchain engineer had to go through to control the fee of their transaction. I see all these posts on Twitter about ""improving the user experience""... and Ethereum ecosystem can't get submitting transactions right... are you kidding me?

**It feels like in Metamask, it's made to be difficult so that people get frustrated and use the highest fee possible.** Tell me I'm crazy and this isn't your experience. Tell me I'm wrong. I'm all for learning how to do everything right.

What happened?

I wanted to sign (and submit) a transaction on metamask with a hardware wallet (HW). It's a smart contract transaction (and a big one, so the execution fee is unusually high), so I wanted to minimize the fee. Metamask was suggesting something like 45 gwei, which is very expensive and I'm not in a hurry. In blockchain (whether it's bitcoin, monero or otherwise), we're supposed to have the freedom to submit our transactions with low fees, and when the network is less congested it will go through. Right... RIGHT?

So, I whip out my HW  (which is a hassle, and I don't want to do it many times), I sign the transaction with 8 gwei, and submit it. 

To my surprise, not only the transaction failed, but the nonce is not incrememnted (not a smart contract transaction failure, as I see on the block explorer), AND METAMASK HAS NO OPTION TO REBROADCAST THE TRANSACTION, even though it's NOT invalid!!!!

I thought, OK, maybe this is a glitch. I'll do it again. I redo the signing with my HW. And it failed again, and again, and again. At that point, I realized that this is just Metamask trying to make my life hell. There's no option to rebroadcast, and it WANTS TO FORCE ME TO USE A HIGH FEE, so EVERY TIME I WANT TO SUBMIT THE SAME FREAKING TRANSACTION, I HAVE TO SIGN IT AGAIN????? Wtf is that supposed to be?

And here's what's even worse: There's no way to extract the signed transaction as a hex string, so that I can submit it later elsewhere... how dare I want to pay less fees? I must be crazy!

So, I was done with this shit and now I'm just stubborn. I opened the developer tools in the browser, tracked the function that submits transactions in Metamask, and pulled the transaction hex from the belly of that fox. Done. Now I have the signed transaction hex. 

Here's where Metamask problems end, and Etherscan problems begin.

I go to pushTx on Etherscan to submit the transaction, submit it, track it on Etherscan, and sleep on it.

Today in the morning, I wake up, I try to check the transaction, it hasn't gone through (it's not in a block yet), EVEN THOUGH THE SUGGESTED FEE NOW IS LOWER THAN THE FEE I USED FOR THE TRANSACTION. Etherscan still says that my transaction didn't go through. So what's wrong? 

If I have to guess what happened, I think all stakers/miners dropped my transaction from their mempools. Fine, I understand (even though this is hostile to user experience since all this is within 12 hours). So, I try to submit my transaction again using the hex I collected yesterday, but Etherscan complains that the transaction is ""already known""... wtf is that???? I immediately recognize that this is ANOTHER BUG... Etherscan has the transaction in its cache, but it's not in the mempool!

I go to another website that offers transaction hex submission, I submitted, and my transaction went through in 1 minute. NIGHTMARE IS F**KING OVER!

Conclusion: WTF was that? Am I the only one in the world who controls their fees?

**Edit:** Serious conclusion: If you're not a tech nerd like me, there's no way to defer submitting a transaction with low fee to a later time. You can only just keep signing the same transaction again and again when the fee you want is viable, or increase the fee. Horrible for usability.

**Edit 2:** Imagine being so tribal that you downvote such a detailed post from a blockchain expert explaining a real problem in Ethereum ecosystem. And the Ethereum community wonders why people complain about usability. If you cared, this post would get 1 million upvotes.

Reddit,ethereum,Why nearly everyone misunderstands rollups. How it's possible to have both an optimistic bridge and zk bridge on a single rollup.,2024-11-21 23:40:26,"One of the most interesting panels at Devcon this month was **""[This is how rollups really work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k)"" by Kelvin Fichter** from Optimism, who says that most people in the crypto community have an incorrect understanding for what is a rollup.

This is actually a fairly deep concept, and there are even parts I still don't fully understand.

####**Most of us have an incorrect concept of what a rollup is**

Fichter brings up the idea that the concept of an ""optimistic rollup"" or ""zk rollup"" doesn't actually exist because ""classical rollups"" (i.e. smart contract rollups) are not purely defined by their smart contract bridges. Classical rollups can actually have multiple bridges, and they aren't necessarily fixed to one L1<>L2 bridge.

**The precise definition of a rollup he prefers is**:

> A blockchain that uses another blockchain for ordering and data availability.

In other words:

* Compressed data is completely stored on L1 (or in blobs)
* L1 ultimately provides ordering for the transactions in the rollup data
* For classical rollups, L1 also provides consensus for rollups through a trust-minimized bridge. For sovereign rollups, L2 nodes provide consensus.

And that's it. It does not necessarily need to have a bridge with optimistic proofs or zk proofs. And sovereign rollups do not even use the base layer for consensus.

This isn't the first time this idea has been brought up. Several other notable discussions:

* Jon Charbonneau - https://dba.mirror.xyz/LYUb_Y2huJhNUw_z8ltqui2d6KY8Fc3t_cnSE9rDL_o (an excellent summary)
* Kelvin Fichter - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlxSP_ABE4Y
* Toghrul Maharramov - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey1_acXL0k

####**What would happen if a rollup had more than 1 bridge (optimistic + zk)?**

The vast majority of rollups we're familiar with (e.g. Optimism, Arbitrum One, Base, Linea) have exactly 1 enshrined bridge. We typically call them ""optimistic rollups"" or ""zk rollups"" as **a simplification of the definitions** because their main smart contract bridge back to L1 with the vast majority of TVL uses either optimistic proofs or zk proofs. If that single L1<>L2 bridge were compromised, the whole network would practically be compromised. So for simplicity, we assign the value of the rollup to that single bridge.

But technically, someone else could build a zk bridge on an ""optimistic rollup"" to store sequenced transaction data on L1. And if over time, 99% of the TVL transfers from the optimistic bridge over to the zk bridge, it would shift from being an optimistic rollup to a hybrid rollup and then to a zk rollup.

While I can't think of any rollup that currently has multiple types of bridges, the concept isn't new.

For example, the **Polygon PoS network** was originally a Plasma chain because it had a [Plasma bridge] (https://polygonscan.com/txnbridge) (that's still active). Later on, it shifted to a smart contract bridge, which ended up with nearly all the TVL activity. There are 2 main bridges on the same network, so Polygon PoS is more than just a Plasma chain or a Side chain. It's a network with 2 bridges of different types.

Overall, I think it's still fine to refer rollups as an ""optimistic rollup"" or a ""zk rollup"" as a simplification, but it's important to understand how rollups really works and why those terms are technically misleading.",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

Reddit,ethereum,I just got banned from /Bitcoin for “shilling” ETH,2024-11-22 22:18:08,"I just got banned from r/Bitcoin for “shilling” ETH. Such emotional and uneducated boomer mods over there. 

All I said was that ETH has more utility than BTC which is undeniably true.

I support both BTC and ETH but this toxicity between both “sides” is what is preventing new investors from pouring in. 

When half of what they hear is that BTC is a scam and it has no utility, and the other half is that ETH is a scam with pre-mined coins and unlimited inflation, I can see why potential “outsiders” are skeptical with the entire industry. 

This bickering needs to stop between BTC and ETH communities. Lots of legit scams out there in the crypto industry, but using “scam” to describe the two most legit cryptos in the industry is pulling us back from true mass adoption. 

I think BTC is the superior store of value. That doesn’t mean ETH doesn’t have potential to be the future of DeFi.

Reddit,ethereum,How to get Ethereum from my early 2016 Ethereum Wallet,2024-11-21 16:42:23,"In Feb 2016 I mined less than 1 Ethereum (says 0.70 probably closer to 0.69).  I can see the funds on Ethereum-Wallet-win64-0-3-9, which is also from Feb 2016.  I just ignored this for years as I didn't need the money but I do now.

I tried to send a very small amount to a Coinbase account I made.  Coinbase gives me the same address for receiving ETH from either ""Ethereum"" or ""Base"" Networks, so that's the address I used.  I tried a small amount to test (0.001) and it's at 0 of 12 confirmations for several hours now - so it did not work.  The first gas fees I tried were too low, but it did accept a higher gas fee and I had to input my password so means it's talking to the network to some extent right?

Under my 2016 Ethereum Wallet application, there is a ""Wallet Contracts"" section and an option to ""Add Wallet Contract"" and I don't have anything there.  But I'm wary to try to do much more with this nearly 9 years old Application.  When I click ""Etherbase"" with the key symbol it says ""Accounts can't display incoming transactions, but hold and send ether."" So I should be able to send from here, right?

I downloaded Ethereum Wallet and Mist Beta 0.11.1 - windows hotfix from Github today.  But it doesn't work on my PC.  ""Checksum mismatch in downloaded node!"" with an MD5 listed and then ""Please install the Geth node version 1.8.23 manually"".  Maybe because I have an older version?

Over 12K dedicated to Ethereum enthusiasts came together, creating an unforgettable atmosphere.

Incredible to see how Devcon continues to grow and evolve into a larger-scale event each year.

Over the years, Devcon has been hosted in incredible locations across the globe, including Germany, the UK, China, Mexico, the Czech Republic, Japan, Colombia, and Thailand.

So, the big question is: **Where will the next Devcon be held?** 👇

**My bet is Africa!**

* Devcon has touched almost every continent, and Africa feels like the natural next step to expand Ethereum’s reach.
* Africa has hosted countless blockchain courses, hackathons, and conferences in recent years, demonstrating a deep and growing interest in blockchain technologies. 
* Vitalik Buterin has visited Africa multiple times, championing blockchain innovation across the continent. In Zambia, a dynamic group of young entrepreneurs is working diligently with Vitalik’s support to position the country as a burgeoning technology hub in Africa. Furthermore, Ethereum developers are actively engaged in raising awareness and fostering growth within the African blockchain community.

The most compelling reason for my prediction lies in the burgeoning interest in Ethereum and blockchain technology among the African community. The enthusiasm for Ethereum and blockchain tech in Africa is unmatched.

At Devcon, there was an interesting talk by David Uzochukwu from Node Bridge Africa, who discussed the challenges and opportunities of running Ethereum nodes in Africa. He shared about overcoming infrastructure limitations, leveraging community support, the potential economic empowerment through staking, and fostering local adoption and innovation.

🔗 [youtube.com/watch?v=\_AywwOgu2zY](http://youtube.com/watch?v=_AywwOgu2zY)

With this growing interest and activity, I believe we’ll see a significant shift in ETH’s global node distribution, and Africa will soon have a notable presence.

So, that's my guess!

**Cape Town, Zambia, Zanzibar, or any other African city may be our next Devcon destination.**

Follow the directions there and you will now have GoLang working on your machine. This is the programming language the Geth Ethereum node software is written in.

Next you need to download the Geth github repo. This is the actual Go-Ethereum node software that lets you run an Ethereum node, but we are not going to run the node itself. Instead we are going to run a tool that is part of the git repo, so you need to download the whole repo. You can do this by going here:

What we want it the \`ethkey\` sub directory. So navigate there in your terminal.

Once there you can type the following to build the program and run it in the local directory:  
\`go run .\`

You should now see the help page for the utility and it should look something like this:

Now copy your keyfile into the same directory as \`/cmd/ethkey\` and type in the following:

\`go run . inspect --private keyfile.json\`

Make sure you make the \`keyfile.json\` part of the command is the name of your keyfile. This will generate an output like this ( this is a burner account so don't bother trying to go dump it ):

The line that says \`Private key:\` is your private key. You can copy and paste this into Metamask or whatever.

Reddit,ethereum,Newb question re WBETH,2024-11-11 21:45:59,"A long time ago (pre kids) I had some ETH in Binance. For some reason I converted it to WBETH, and then promptly forgot all about pretty much all of my crypto assets upon the birth of child 1. 

I've now decided to revisit my holdings and found myself wondering what the point of WBETH is? From what I understand, it is wrapped ETH that I can use for staking. However, I'm in the UK and can't stake on Binance. So what should I do? 

I thought perhaps send it to my Coinbase wallet, but they don't support it. So should it just convert it back to ETH?",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

The real story isn’t a $3K dip—it’s that Bitcoin is at **$95K**, and you’re complaining. 

We’ve gone from magic internet money to a global reserve contender. 

From zero to shaking up central banks.

Panicking over a tiny blip is like losing your mind because a marathon runner paused for water. 

Relax. 

The network’s still cranking out blocks, adoption’s still growing, and the long-term trend is up.

Reddit,bitcoin,Finally did it!,2024-11-24 16:18:10,"After starting in Oct. 2021 it has finally happened. I’ve successfully mined 1 BTC. 
I purchased 3 antminer’s late 2021 and made it my goal to mine enough btc to pay for my children to attend college when the time came (still have another 12 years). Hodling small amounts while also DCA’ing $25/week since 2018 has eased my mind as far as my children are concerned. 
Last night I looked and saw that my total mining rewards since starting had finally crossed the 1 BTC mark. An amazing milestone in my eyes and I figured you guys would be the only group to tell that could share same joy I have. I can say, it hasn’t necessarily been a long hard winding road like it is for most because my goal has always been to utilize my BTC almost 2 decades from when I began this journey, however, I still can’t believe where we are now and the hopes of wealth for my kids beyond not having to worry about college is truly a great feeling. 
I’d like to thank this sub for all of the information it has provided over the years. 
Mainly pulling my BTC from the exchange and putting it into cold storage. I did it about a month before the whole SBF debacle even though my BTC wasn’t on FTX, it sure felt good knowing that I wouldn’t have to worry about this happening to myself. Over the years I’ve kept my mouth shut, mined, stacked, and smiled a little bigger every time I looked at my wallet. 
It’s been amazing fellas. 
Obligatory statement-No private messages here will be answered at all.

Two things happened in the fall of 2017: first the service I was using, Coinbase, inexplicably said all Canadians had to find a new wallet / exchange and gave very little notice.  I scrambled and searched up the largest / best service operating in Canada at the time and moved my stash over.  

The second thing that happened was Jamie Dimon came out with his infamous “fraud” comments.  I was and remain a fan of his.  I was sitting on a nice six-bagger so I liquidated my coins and proceeded to try to cash out. 

Well in my scramble to find a new service that worked in Canada I had found myself at QuadrigaCX.  I’ll cut it short but in the end in fact I did get my proceeds but only because I was VERY persistent over a number of weeks. I believe I was corresponding with Gerald Cotton himself in the emails as later it turned out he did basically everything there and if I recall correctly there were basically no other employees.  To this day I believe the only reason I got my money back was because I inundated the guy with messages and became the squeakiest wheel. 

Finally, yes I understand that my stash would today be worth about $750,000 USD. But if I’d have HEDL I’m sure my dude would have taken my stash to India where he seems to have met his demise.   I don’t think people got much if any out after Quadriga blew up.

Reddit,bitcoin,My Accidental Bitcoin Journey Ended Tonight,2024-11-23 06:35:13,"I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.  At any given time, I had several of them in an online wallet (don’t even remember where). I eventually stopped partying so much, but still had 3-4 laying around.  By the time I moved back to the US in 2015, I remembered the wallet and was shocked to see that what was originally maybe $50 worth of coins had turned into something like $1500. I didn’t understand it, but that is when I started reading more about it.  I would talk about it with friends and try to convince them to buy.  I eventually built my stack up to about 7 bitcoins by late 2017. As the price soared, I kept imagining my life as a millionaire.  When the crash happened, I forgot all about its cyclic nature and panicked, selling 4 of them around the $7K mark.  I invested that $30K and left the 3 remaining bitcoins in my wallet.  And they stayed there for 6 more years.  In 2023, I sold another one for about $25K to help pay for my wedding. At that point I vowed to not sell my last 2 until it mooned.  Today, my wife and I did something we never thought possible - we made an offer on an investment property.  It was accepted tonight and I sold my last two remaining bitcoins, for just shy of $200K so that I had the funds for a down payment.

Maybe I played the game horribly.  Maybe I would have $700K worth of bitcoin if I stuck to my original plan of keeping 7 bitcoins.  I don’t know. Feels pretty good to turn a pretty small investment into a 25% down payment on an investment property though.

I’ll continue to occasionally buy bitcoin after this, but I recognize that I may never afford to ever get close to owning 1 BTC ever again, let alone multiple.  But I’m ok with it.  I got a debt-free wedding and an investment property out of it.  I’m happy.

Just a little story to say that it’s ok to use your bitcoin to fund your life along the way.  It’s likely part of the journey.  Be well. 


Edit:  I’m blown away by all the responses!  I honestly expected it to be 80% negative.  So, thank you to those well wishers.  I honestly get and understand the negative sentiment.  I found myself in an unbelievably lucky position and squandered it all away (according to naysayers).  I will continue to believe in and buy bitcoin.  There’s still plenty of time to invest in it as a retirement option.  I wanted passive income and diversification, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.  Cheers. 

Edit 2:  Lots of comments/questions about taxes.  Yes, it’s all capital gains. Yes, we are covered. Long story short, my wife worked for a major tech company that paid her in stock as part of her salary. Instead of cashing her shares every month, she kept them and lived off just her salary.  That stock tanked 3 years ago and has lost 70+% of its value.  She finally sold yesterday so that we can write off her losses against my gains.",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

Think about the implications as Bitcoin moves toward $200k, $500k, and eventually $1M+ in the coming decade. As institutional adoption increases, with countries and banks competing to secure their Bitcoin reserves, the scarcity will become far more intense than most realize.

The next 20 years, particularly with Pluto in Aquarius (representing technological transformation of financial systems), suggest we're entering an era where Bitcoin becomes increasingly integrated into the global financial infrastructure.

This isn't only about price, it's about accessibility. The opportunity to own a full Bitcoin will likely become increasingly rare for the average person, similar to how owning an entire block of prime real estate in a major city became unreachable for most.

While Bitcoin remains divisible, the psychological and financial significance of owning 1 full BTC will become a marker of early understanding and action during this transformative period.

This needs to be realized by more people because this as a once in a lifetime opportunity. Accumulate and think long term! ",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

""The company primarily funds its Bitcoin acquisitions through debt financing, including convertible bonds, allowing it to raise capital without diluting existing shares15. This strategy creates a feedback loop where rising Bitcoin prices enhance MicroStrategy's stock value, enabling further investment in Bitcoin34. Additionally, MicroStrategy employs dollar-cost averaging, purchasing fixed dollar amounts over time to mitigate volatility risks"".

This cannot be stopped. The ONLY way for other companies to compete is to copy the strategy, opening more btc black holes. Companies will be forced to adapt or get left in the dust.

Reddit,bitcoin,When you bought in early and still held till this day. ,2024-11-24 10:57:55,"You should not have cared about money that much. Its the only way and lesson. Because if you do care about it you go nuts seeing all those gains. Constantly checking your portfolio. The reason many people sell because they dont want that shit anymore. Then you either learn to deal with it (which is impossible if you care too much about money) OR you sell and bedone with it. Only to regret selling. 

To deal with this regret is to finally see (and experience) that money isnt everything in the world. That all the money you need to buy basics plus some pocketmoney is all the money you need. its to understand that once you have a million and others have ten million. That you also want to have ten million. And now you consider yourself poor. And that once you have enough money to never have to work again certain problems arise. Like a disconnection with other people that still have to scramble for money. That the excitement of finally being able to buy something you wanted to have for a long time is gone now. 

That people are full out jealous of you or/and start shunning you. Or that people start to expect you pay for them and what not. 

To me, one of the biggest wealths in the world is to see that money isnt everything. To not be a money slave. A money hoarder. And that there is no need to chase it. It doesnt solve anything, other then mayb ofcourse get out of debt or some sort. Or being no longer broke. But that is different from having the basics.

But the caveat is that this asset is finite, while the value of our dollar will always go down due to the relationship with debt/printing money. So while confidence in BTC can go down at times:

I’m curious, those of you who have been HOLDING and profiting along the way (nothing wrong with that) or those of you who have been HODLING since beginning to like 2017–how do you feel about the current situation?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"If you make money in an alt rally, TAKE PROFIT",2024-11-24 21:59:09,"As everyone here knows nearly ever crypto will bleed value against BTC over an extended period of time.

Yes some traders may be lucky enough to buy an altcoin before a rally and if you are good for you, but TAKE PROFIT. Seriously. You bought Cardano at $.45 and it more than doubles - at a minimum get back your initial USD investment. Holding profitable alts long term is how this sub probably loses the most money. 

**If you make money on an alt** 

**Do:** 

* **get back your initial investment**

**Do not:** 

* **Hodl everything for even more future profits** 
* **Double Down and buy more** 

**Seriously if this post trends check the comments of this post and I guarantee people will tell you how they bought an alt in 2021 held for huge gains and then held back down for a significant loss.**  

\-----

If you are new here learn from the mistakes of those that were here for previous cycles, take profit on alts. Period.  

Some Alt to BTC charts below to help visualize and reinforce what I'm saying.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,We're still early. ,2024-11-24 21:21:59,"I like to use credit cards as a comparison. What would later become Visa was first launched in 1958 by Bank of America. It was initially known as the [BankAmericard credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.#:~:text=Visa%20was%20founded%20in%201958,other%20financial%20institutions%20in%201966) program. Fast forward a couple decades, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRwJw3Bdavs) to see how people reacted to Burger King's news that it would accept credit cards at all locations in 1993. The tenor? Skepticism. Adoption takes time. People adjusting to new systems, vocabulary, and behavior takes time. We're still early.

However, don't be stupid. Make a plan. Here's my plan: I'm selling a third of all my holdings once the total market cap of all coins hits 4 trillion dollars. I'll sell another third of all my holdings once the total market market cap hits 7 trillion dollars. Most of my portfolio is in BTC. The majority of my other holdings are the big L1 smart contract platforms that can handle volume. I don't know which will win so I own several of them. I figure that if 1 to 3 win in the bag, then it'll pay for the losses of the rest. If crypto falls below 2 trillion total market cap, then I'll resume DCA in my portfolio. At current prices I'm not buying anything.

That's my plan. I'm not saying that it's the best plan, but it's what I'm doing. Yes we're early. But make a plan so that you're not second guessing yourself everyday as prices shift around.",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

COTI 5% up

SUPER 32% up

From 10 coins only 2 are up, and from 2 only 1 has a significant gain. I'm not saying that they are not going to pump, I'm still holding till Q3 2025 but it was pretty bad advice and during bad time. Remember - they advertised them as ""hidden gems"" who will do x10

To be honest that YouTube channel makes me sick now, it's like legal scam advertising dead coins and getting paid by creators, they are 100% biased. I'm surprised they have so many subscribers so I just want to warn you - if you watch it, just use reverse psychology and do everything opposite than what they say",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Another day at the office folks…,2024-11-24 19:17:02,"Too much should we sell, how high is it going? Etc etc etc 🤮🤮

Calm down!  It’s another day at the office, nothing out of the ordinary, buy the dips, hold the plan, dca all day!

We are here because we believe in the projects and the overall goals ( or at least should be ), and nothing has changed except the train is now picking up speed and it will be exponential to all our original starting points around this time in the journey.

So sit down, shut up, and hold on, because it’s gonna wobble, May go up, May go down, but ultimately, we ain’t seen nothing yet, and that is the most indisputable factor of the crypto space!

So, like me, continue to add and take advantage of these little dips as they are all apart of the A++ dca and hodl game by buying at the various points and best of all dips or reconsolidations, and one day we will look back on this from a secured financial point of our own individual journey and will have stories and stories to tell.

It all goes back to the original mantra…

We ain’t fucking selling!

Have a great Sunday folks, looking forward to the next weeks!",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

# Start

The year is 2024, you are seeing bitcoin and crypto coming into your timeline more and more. USA just elected a president who is pro crypto. Elon Musk is jumping up and down on Trump rally and he's also pro crypto. You are wondering ""is this just internet magic money? Is this a ponzi scheme? Why the heck would I use a currency , fiat already exists. There are no additional use cases""



# The Ideology

^(You can ignore this part if you are already tired of reading similar summary over and over again. Remember this is MY opinion and does not reflect everyone's opinion. This part also has a lot of compiled conspiracy theory and not my own.)

1912, Titanic just sank and took down old banking system. The Rothschild bankers and few others who happened to be off the boat, has now gripped the world financial system. Federal Reserve which can indefinitely print money supply in exchange for gold was established in 1913. WW1 and WW2 followed shortly which introduced massive amounts of temporary tax (we still are in that temporary taxation system). Till 1970, we had this certificate (now fiat money) , that was printed and backed by Gold, oil and few other global commodities. The more commodity a country had, the more value it's printed certificate (dollar, rupee etc.) had. Gold and oil was the ""native liquidity currency"". Remember this: ""native liquidity currency"". USA being the new super leader, decided to hoard as much gold and oil possible by dealing with as many countries as possible. US dollar or any other fiat currency had this pair ($ Country's money / Gold)

1971, USA has a significant amount of gold, and oil, and a grip on the world. USSR (now Russia) was and still is it's arch rival. By now, USA has already made a few great decision for itself by establishing itself as a world native liquidity currency. ***USA decided to depeg the gold from it's native liquidity.*** 

Which means before it was ***($ USD / Gold ) but now it's ($ USD / \_\_\_\_)***. Where as the rest of the world was ($ Rupee / USD), ($Yen / USD). Trades were and still happens in USD, even now. If you want to send a shipment of paint from China to Bangladesh, it's done in USD. Not yen, not taka.  

**Now the question is, if my country's currency has a US dollar reserve and USD is being treated as one of the major liquidity currency, what about USD? What is USD's own native liquidity pair?  :)**   
**I will leave the history of 1971-2000s fill out your imagination.** 

  
From the 1900 - 2000, the old banking system has significantly shifted from being Gold backed to US dollar backed. USA is also printing as much as it wants out of thin air with nothing but war behind it's liquidity backing. Any country that is trying to get back to gold or oil standard has been uprooted. So paper money is literally being made from trees. 

***Fiat currency supply keeps going up, value keeps going down. If USA prints, your country's currency is gaining strength but that all depends on whether they are NOT printing themselves. This macro economics majorly affects us and crypto every single day. The key for your country is to stop printing while USA prints.*** 

  
Your parents have immediately felt the affects of this depegging over 1970s - 2000s. Everything inflated fast. Their salary was not that far off of inflated value of homes, cars, food. Taxes were not that bad, it was supposed to be temporary but it was acceptable. 

You were born in the 80s - 2000s, now you are either in your 20s or your 40s. You are in this subreddit trying to figure out how do you get rich via crypto and how to get out of this rut. Where's this get rich quick scheme?

  
2009 - Satoshi (a person or group of people or psyop by the banking system), invented BTC Bitcoin. Digital currency that can't be printed. The idea that one day it will become a native liquidity currency like gold or oil. Unhackable because you'd have to hack all the mining computers all at once. Mining means you use your computer to act as part of the ledger system that keeps transactions all in sync and calculated while solving a formula to SLOWLY mine 21 million bitcoin (total). All of a sudden you can send money overseas without any issues, albeit transaction fee is expensive af. However, this is the only thing banks and feds cannot touch or tax(However, we all know decentralized - they cannot, centralized - they can, we will dive in to this later). You can hold on to it and battle this unlimited printing of fiat. You know rest of the usual story that people say so we won't be diving more into this. 



# Deep dive into Defi

Decentralized is a word that gets thrown around every where. Everyone claims to be decentralized in crypto and btc subforums. However, 90% of the people are just buying and holding in CEX (centralized exchanges like binance). They are then selling it for USDT for profit or loss, and sending it back to their banks for fiat. They were never decentralized. They don't use bitcoin for anything. They don't use ethereum for anything. They don't use solana for anything. 

  
So what can you use these coins for? Is it just for silk road like the early bitcoin days? I pay someone in btc and someone gives me the limited edition pokemon card on ebay?  Sure, but no.

  
DeFi truly started during introduction of Ethereum by an alpha centauri alien called Vitalik. It didn't have a max supply like bitcoin, it was exactly like fiat in the sense that you can print it. However, printing was not controlled by the ETH foundation, it was printed by miners. You had to mine it. Why would we buy eth if it's still being printed? 

  
ETH had 3 tricks up it's sleeve. 

1. dApps (decentralized apps - it's what apps are to smart phones - whaaaat?)
2. Layer 2 EVMs (make your own network - wow!)
3. tokens (its like a coin, you can attach a name to)

>  
If Bitcoin is gold , Ethereum is silver. Gold is a store of value, where silver is a tool

  
**2018 - The birth of Uniswap:**

dApp builders like myself started scrambling and figuring out what to make. What can we all make in this brand new finance world? 

One of the first key things that came out was Uniswap. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. Anyone can make a token and upload it with eth as it's native liquidity pair (token/ETH). In return Uniswap gave that user a liquidity pool token which is like a key that you can use to unlock the pair and pull out the money if they wanted. 

No more applying to CEX like binance for listing your own project, no more accredited investor status required for buying and selling things, no tax (controversial), and definitely cannot be frozen by banks. 

You can buy and sell any token that you want, you can make your own token (if you knew how to code in ethereum smart contract language called solidity), and you can make your token tradeable via uniswap. All you had to do was go on subforums and talk about your own tokens. What you needed was a wallet like metamask with actual ETH (not in CEX), you needed to press wallet connect on uniswap, and spend that ETH to buy tokens, or sell tokens to get some ETH. There were no middle men. No one can hack uniswap. 

  
Now what happened really? Our core degenerate mindset got us to start building shitcoins by now. 99% of the tokens on uniswap are scams, the users just unlocked and withdrew the liquidity (ETH) with the liquidity pool token. What if the token smart contract was a scam by itself? I will put a list of things for you to see before you buy any shitcoins directly on uniswap.  

\----   
  
**2020 - The birth of DxSale, and other launchpads**

Ah, this is something that takes you to some of the golden age of shitcoins. DxSale and Unicrypt made it easy for anyone to make a token. You didn't need to know how to write contracts anymore, those defi apps made it for you and you own it. Your wallet owns the token as the creator. You can make a token within seconds without knowing how to code, and raise funds in those same apps. Once the funds are raised, it automatically uploaded the token/ETH as a liquidity pair on Uniswap. Uniswap returned the liquidity pool token to the Launchpad smart contracts which automatically locked the liquidity pool (LP) token (key). This solved the number one issue with Uniswap launches, which is scam by unlocking LP and disappearing in to thin air. 

Great, now all you had to do was marketing and you have a token on ethereum, you could either try to launch it hard and make your coin go 100x or if you were a scam - you would've just found another way like dump the team tokens or perhaps add ""fee system""

Out came the rebase tokens, fee tokens, burn tokens etc. People started making custom tokens with some sort of fee at every buys and sells. Scammers decided to make buy fee 1% and sell fee 99%. You can buy but not sell, even if you buy it on launchpads like Dxsale or Dex like Uniswap. Scammers just like to abuse the system in deFi. It's the wild west. You either made a 83500x (yes it happened), or you lost it all. You probably lost it all if you were there in the wild west of 2021. 

dAPP builders though sold the shovels by making these apps in Ethereum and other L2s. The great part is, when we made these apps for Ethereum, it worked on Layer 2 networks like coinbase's Base network, so when another network became popular because of degenerate gamblers - these dApps already supported it. For example Binance smart chain network (BSC) was really popular around 2021-2022. Instead of using eth, people would use BNB to use these apps or make any transaction, BNB was the native currency and liquidity currency of BSC. 



>Was it all just financial or were there other use cases for Ethereum apps?

  
**NFTs: The type of token we never wanted but we still got**

Out came NFTs, ah NFTs... the middle child no one wants to talk about any more. NFTs were tokens that were not divisible. You cannot divide them like a regular token. Which means they had a different use case. You cannot really make it uniswap tradable because you had to buy a full NFT not a 0.00000001 of an NFT. All you can do is list your NFTs and some one else purchases it. 

Instantly, it became synonymous with art (jpegs). dApps like Rarible came out and started trying to be a marketplace for making and listing your NFTs. Some of you paid 100k for a ape's picture. I myself was not into NFTs except for my attempt at building an NFT fighting game. 

Eventually scammers found their way into NFT world as well. They used it to sell NFTs but never build anything else after that. Other ways they've used it is to launder money that they've made from scamming from traditional tokens. NFTs died as fast as they came.

  
**Farming**

One of the best use cases of dApps was farming apps like Beefy. You can earn an apy by using providing liquidity to Beefy farms. You can make a 6-11% by using USDT or a variation of USD (stable coins) which was a safe-ish way to make money. (Luna usd was not safe as we all know).  My own experience with farming was subpar at most, but it's my fault - i was scared of flash crashes of any coins whether they were a good coin or not. However, this is much safer than the shitcoin wild west of launchpads and uniswap. Farming is sort of like managed savings account, you manage the farm you want to gather apy from and hope nothing crashed and wiped you out. 

  
Till 2023, Ethereum and EVMs (Layer 2 networks) looked like it had all the game on their hands. All the app developers are on it. ""There are no other ethereum killer"". Plenty of different networks came and went. I remember trying to learn a different network's code and it just was not worth learning at the time... it was going great for us until... fire nation attacked (Solana). 

\-----   
  
**2024 Solana and it's golden child Pump fun with it's dex Raydium.**

Solana is a different network. It's not a layer 2 of Ethereum. Holy smokes its fast, holy smokes it doesn't work sometimes but when it does, im not spending $10 when i buy or sell a shitcoin. What's uniswap? Raydium is here. Dxsale? Nah son, it's pump fun. No more putting token amount, and calculating how many tokens I get as a developer, and how much for marketing yada yada yada. All it took on pump fun was $1 worth of solana and my solana token was live. I can just live stream on twitch and market my shitcoin. Just last night (relative to when im writing this on nov 24), some guy had his girlfriend inside a cage on twitch and raising funds on pump fun. No more locking liquidity, we burn the liquidity. 

Scammers are no longer only using technical tactics to scam, scammers have gotten dumber but bolder. They're scamming on live stream and showing their face. 

Solana started getting hot, it went 10x within a year due to so many people switching from ETH and other EVMs to play on this hot shiny new tech. Out with solidity coding, Rust is my new best friend. Ethereum killer? Yet to find out, but this is the only network that came this close.

You want to be in this new wild west? All you need is Phantom wallet with Real Solana (not CEX solana), connect to dApps like raydium or pump fun and start your degeneracy. Just like 2021, either you make 80,000x or zero. Most of the time you lose everything.

I was one of the loser dApp founders who decided not to sell shovels in this new wild west of Solana. I am now outwitted by Solana companies.   
\-----

**Bridge:**

So how do you stay decentralized while moving funds from ETH/EVM L2s to the new wild west solana? Thats where bridge ""dApp"" came from. The reason I put quotation is because they are not quite decentralized. They have some sort of code in between to move funds from one network to other for you with a fee. However by doing this, you avoid putting large sums of money into an exchange and getting it stuck due to whatever reasons. Perhaps you wanted to avoid identification (KYC) and linking it to your bank. deBridge is a very good bridge that everyone uses. Very easy to use. 

Bridges have been prone to be hacked due to their centralized nature in between the networks. Cross chain bridges are easier to hack than any dApps. 

  
\----   
**How do you avoid getting scammed or hacked or just in general lose money in Defi?**

* If you are diving into the old world of EVMs, remember the tokens can have variable fees like I've mentioned before. Use tools like tokensniffer to see if it's something similar. If a coin has 99% sell fee, it means you can buy but cannot sell.
* Check dextools or dexscreeners for the shitcoin to see how much liquidity is there, whether it's locked on Dxlock or Unicrypt, or whether it's burned. 
* Check if it's a honey pot. Many times, a hot token on these chart apps will have 150k liquidity but only 500 holders. If it's 150k liquidity, assume it should have over 3000 holders. 
* Check if it's a CTO (Community take over coin). Many scammers now a days rug pull their own coins, and perform a CTO with another telegram or twitter account. They pretend to be community member who's hell bent on getting this shitcoin up and running again. They rug it for the second time. Avoid CTOs.
* I highly suggest checking solana based token's advice on how to check for scams as I am not the best person for Solana based shitcoin scams. 
* Never connect to unknown dApps. Defi is a world where YOU are responsible. Some dApps out there can drain your wallet. Do not connect or sign things on your wallet that you don't know what it's for. Always do your research on the dApps. 
* If you are new and not used to trenches, be prepared to lose 99.99% of your sol or eth on shitcoins. That's how you learn what to look out for, honestly..
* Do not buy NFTs at the moment, they are dead.
* If you are not within the first 10 buyers of a hot shitcoin, you are last. You will be exit liquidity. Many marketcaps reach 10 million market cap then back down to 100k. It is what it is. Buy high sell low logic applies almost every time.

**2027 and beyond - Has bitcoin become a dinosaur? What's next for DeFi?**

  
This is a very good topic and maybe an insight that you'd like to know for the next in this crypto wild west of Defi. Yes bitcoin is old, bitcoin is slow. However, bitcoin has and always will be king. It does not print like eth or solana. 

>  
But what about making shitcoins on Bitcoin? Can Bitcoin have something like Eth or Sol?

  
There already is something like that, it's called ""Runes"". Runes is a HOT new protocol that uses Bitcoin's messaging system to let you make tokens (they're called runes on bitcoin). It's a slow protocol currently which takes about 10 minutes to 30 minutes for a transaction and costs alot. It congests bitcoin miners. 

Crypto is all about the hot new thing. The hot new thing always comes one cycle earlier and gets popular in the next cycle. I will explain the cycles in the next topic. One hot shitcoin equivalent of runes is called DOG\*GO\*TO\*THE\*MOON ($DOG). It's the biggest rune currently on the bitcoin ecosystem. Its around 1B mcap already. 

Why am I mentioning Runes? I am not sure whether Runes will be the next big thing. However I do know one thing, bitcoin has the biggest maxis and biggest share of the market. Runes protocol opened up DeFi for bitcoin. If you want to make your own runes, you can download Magic Eden Wallet or Phantom Wallet, and use Magic Eden Wallet to trade runes.

Using the same messaging system, there's also an NFT equivalent called ""Ordinals"". I would not buy Ordinals , it will suffer the same fate as NFTs. 

The beauty of Runes is that the native currency is Bitcoin. There are no other coins that you need to buy before you dive into Runes shitcoin narratives. Could it beat 2024 Solana world? Who knows? All I know is, a few dApp builders are racing to solve a few problems with the runes ecosystem including myself. 

>  
What about SUI? My crypto friend was talking about SUI at work

  
Do your own research about SUI. It could also very well be the next Solana. SUI is much faster than Bitcoin Runes so it's easy to use. Only time will tell whether a slow titan (Bitcoin) or a small chain like SUI will win the next cycles hype.

\----

  
**Narrative advice**

Every cycle, check for the next narrative. You can buy and hope that your picks become the hot new topic in the next cycle. Something that is brewing now like bitcoin runes shitcoins or dapps OR sui native coin, sui shit tokens or dapps might be the winner in 2027. It's upto the dApp developers to come up with the hot new shovel that will drive these type of narratives. 



# Crypto Cycles and Insight

I am sure you've heard about the bitcoin halving cycles and have learned that majority of the people use these cyclical nature to buy low and sell high. 6 months post halving is when bull run tends to start. A few months later Alt season where the alt coins (ETH, Solana etc.) start to run and it ends with a bang with memes. 

However, in 2024, we've started with memes. There was a huge pump before halving and some people are saying that the cycle is left shifted. Others are saying that this is a super cycle. No matter what happens and have already happened, if you look at the chart, 2022 was the lowest point that your crypto expert friend have DCA'd through. They have already expected that halving or around halving will be the bull run. So far they look like geniuses, but a dump will come again eventually. It's your job to understand how the previous cycles worked and how this cycle is so far. Find similarities and differences between the previous cycles and this cycle. 

Some example of similarities:

* Halving again called the bull run (controversial I know - you may have another opinion)
* BTC climbing before alt season truly starts
* We are in phase 4 of bitcoin cycle (again controversial)
* We are in Belief or Thrill stage in psychology of market  (controversial)

  
Some examples of differences:

* Meme season started first this time around
* Pre halving pump
* Institutional acceptance (American and Global ETFs)

  
With these differences, you must make your own judgement. Does institutional acceptance mean a super cycle? Do these new boomers who buy the ETFs pull out fast because they think a gain of 20% is a gain of 2 years ? But crypto is used to 300% - 400% minimum.. what happens now? 

No one knows honestly, and everyone's entry point is different. It's up to you when you want to enter. You can either enter now in this part of cycle or enter during a bear market in 2 years. What if the bear market does not come for 4 years? Do you just sit on fiat?

Only YOU can make your decision, I am just here to provide you with some history and narrative.   


>Okay I want to enter now, what are my options? What are the narratives? I understood Defi and bitcoin cycles but what about meme , AI or gaming narratives? 

  
Meme season is a very risky season, the pumps will come without any build up and dump before you can pull out. The pumps usually last 1 day before a 90% dump

AI and Gaming are a hit or miss, you can do your own research to see whether any of those coins pumped right before halving. If they did, perhaps they are the winning horse you want to take on. 

>Overall, do your own research into the winning horses and sit tight. If they're already in All time high (ATH), perhaps avoid it since it's in ""price discovery"". Once it's in price discovery you must be ready to DCA out (take profits), instead of timing the top. No one knows where the top is. **Currently Alt Season has yet to start. Bitcoin needs to stop before Alts pump.**

  


Macroeconomics

This is another controversial topic as others may have other opinions but aside from halving where the supply is cut, interest rate of Global liquidity (USD) still has a large part to play with bitcoin price. When they print USD out of thin air for cheap (low interest), investors tend to put it into stocks , real estate and crypto. With halving cutting the supply of fresh bitcoin, and interest rates dropping - bitcoin price against USD is climbing hard and fast.  

ETFs in the west have also put a strain on the demand. Demand has outweighed so much that every day the boomers are purchasing 40 days of fresh supply of bitcoin. Currently they're buying OTC (over the counter) in bulk from bitcoin holders who held for years. They're not buying from the exchanges.. if they did, the price would've shot up much more. However, there will come a time where OTC dries up and they either tap into cex, and dex or their ETF prices start to climb. This will make bitcoin price go up regardless. 

When Bitcoin and it's ETFs have climbed to a significant amount of market cap, they will jump into ETH ETFs. That will signal the alt season and alt coins will start to climb. 

There are 2 rumoured Solana ETF filings in 2024 as well. 

^(I am sure, you guys are very well versed in macro economics, it would be great to have more additions into this chapter here. This is a deep topic that requires your help.)

# Do's and Don'ts

1. If you are new, do not have expectations with memecoins or shitcoins. DYOR. If you are not first 10 you are last.
2. If you are new, avoid price discovery coins. Buy coins that climbed before halving (winning horses) but not yet ATH from earlier. They will reach their ATH and go past ATH into price discovery. Examples below:
   1. ETH - Not yet price discovery
   2. SOL - Just flirting with price discovery and ATH
   3. BTC - Well into price discovery
3. If you are in Defi wild west, please read the DeFi section to understand the game. Start with money you are okay with losing. Get into X spaces, X and telegram / discord groups before you buy blindly. Read the smart contracts or use token sniffer or charting tools to look at tokenomics and metrics.
4. If you are getting into building, look at new narratives rather than current narratives. You are already too late. 
5. If you are a shitcoin owner, please know that scamming will get you caught. I have seen too many getting caught and its well deserved.
6. Do not believe X influencers or Youtubers, when they're shilling something, they're usually in on it. 
7. Do not blindly believe any thing you read on Yahoo Finance, and any other crypto news outlets. Yahoo finance and other news outlets have paid articles ranging from $500 to 25k. 
8. Do not blindly believe a new shiller DMing you about this next new hot coin thats launched, they're paid shillers on X or telegram. 
9. Do not connect to any unknown dAPPs.
10. Do not keep your money in CEX, or hot wallet keep it inside ledger. I am guilty myself of this and might get screwed any time.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why does Grayscale have premiums/discounts?,2024-11-24 19:12:04,"I'm just confused about why many crypto ETFs A.K.A. ""Trusts"" that Grayscale provides have insane premiums and discounts to the point where the trusts never actually track the true value of the underlying assets.



The Litecoin is an amazing example of this. The NAV is $7.67 when Litecoin is trading at around $93/coin. This means that even if Litecoin hit a bullish price target of $200 - the NAV would still be at most about $16. The price of the Litecoin trust as of Friday close was $16 and change. 

  
So basically, the pricing of the Litecoin ETF today could literally flatline even if Litecoin doubles in value, and the whole performance of the ETF could be just dismissed as ""bringing the premium more in line with the NAV.""

  
So who does this benefit? I mean it's great to trade. Short selling when you know that the premium is still 1.2-1.5x is kind of a no brainer, especially when I emailed them and they told me their goal is to make the premium disappear and make the trust function more like a spot ETF... but I know the Steller Lumens and other trusts Grayscale provides probably do the same thing. That's probably why they lost a TON of people when the Bitcoin spot ETFs came out - because everyone traded the premium/discount propaganda for an ETF that actually tracks the price. 

  
So why do they even do this if they know it's a mess? Who does this benefit? Do hedge funds pay them to inflate/deflate the price to manipulate the market?",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

APT and SUI both started a bullish rebound this afternoon after the recent correction. Could Move-based blockchains be the next major development in crypto?

I’ve been reading that Move is a much more intuitive programming language to learn compared to Solidity. This very well might speed up adoption among developers, leading to a very diverse ecosystem in the near future as more devs hop on board.

I’ve entered the market in early 2017. BTC was at 4K back then. Family members and friends made fun of me (and they kept on doing so until tonight). Friends told me I was WAY too late to invest. I’ve watched this shit skyrocket to 10k, then 20k, then drop down to 3k, never move for 2-3 years, just to shoot up to 40, 50, 60k. But even then everyone belittled my investment (and mindset). When it dropped hard from 60 they felt validated. I never budged though. I truly did not care. Sure, it’s more fun when everything’s up. But I didn’t need the $$ so I was able to just ignore it.

Tonight is my birthday. And I’m fucking cashing out xxx times my initial investment. Oh boy does it feel good. The best part? I’m still in the game. Still holding on to half of my BTC/ETH, but that’s now worth a lot more than my initial investment. A LOT. 

Tonight everybody who grinned at me for “wasting” my money looks stupid. Loved seeing their faces when I told them what I just transferred to my bank account. Tonight I’m grinning. Cheers brothers. Patience is king. I am the king tonight.

Why haven’t I sold everything? Because this journey ain’t over. What I kept in my wallet will stay cold for the next 25 years.

If you believe in this shit, keep at it. But don’t forget to take a little sweet profit here and there. Even if it’s every 8 years.

It says the sell order takes up to 5 minutes to complete.

Turns out my timing was unlucky as 10:15 saw a temporary dip down to 3260 before bouncing right back up over 3300. Oh well, shit happens.

I check my balance (for some reason the app doesn't tell you exactly what it sold for), divide it by the amount of ETH sold, and it turns out that the price I got was 3224.8.

Any graph I look at shows yesterday's low around 3260. I understand that these graphs are an average price of current transactions around that time and aren't perfectly exact, but I can't find any evidence of it hitting 3224 around that time period. Why did it sell for well under the going price?

I know there are more advanced price tracking tools, does anyone who knows how to use them see any evidence of ETH hitting 3224 at the time? I just don't understand it.

I contacted customer support in the app to ask if there's some fee I don't know about or what could explain this, they gave me a generic response along the lines of ""market prices are variable and can change between the time when you place the sell order and it actually gets sold"". I knew that, obviously that can happen and I got a bit unlucky, but for it to drop and also sell for UNDER that amount is just confusing. Whatever happened, taking a 2.9% loss between placing the sell order and it going through is disappointing.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,In response to the prediction that we are nearing the top of this cycle sooner than expected,2024-11-23 21:32:18,"Fellow crypto investors, especially shrimps.

It has come to our short span attention that we might experience a shorter bull run than in the previous cycles. Reasons to consider this happening:

   1. American government begins stashing BTC into the treasury, and everything the government (any government) touches turns to s**t. 


   2. Big, fat, patient whales who have the gov. under control from behind the scenes are happy with a suppressed, short bull market, because it'll be followed by a sudden, unexpected, long mega-bull-run. Key word ""unexpected"", be it 2026 27 or 28...


3. More and more people know about the expected ""buy now, sell in March-May""


4. Global-economy catastrophy, purposely manufactured - see also point 2.


5. I forgot.


Reasons to consider the opposite, and the super BTC cycle to be unleashed with a delay-adjustment of a couple months to induce an uncertainty element from previous bull runs, are the following:

1. Reverse point 1 from above.


2. Fat whales who have the gov. by the balls decide it's time.


3. Asia unleashes the super cycle to outrun the west.


4. BRICS uses soviet tactics and plays the bull run by the books, world follows from FOMO.


5. More countries join the BTC stashing act, while some ignore BTC from the start and decide (whales got the said gov. by the balls as well) to pick some heavily established ALTS as reserve, with few countries evan choosing mid caps that appeared during the bear of '22-'23 as reserve because whales have the gov. officials and lawmakers by the balls.


6. I forgot.


That being said in a most serious way, and considering that I have no PowerPoint or Excel knowledge, take all the above advice with a tone of salt.

Memecoins are the casino of this cycle.  As long as you treat them like a casino you should be fine.  But I can just feel there will be a lot of room temperature IQ individuals putting massive amounts of money into memecoins that they can’t afford to lose.

Memecoins are not an investment.  You are not a crypto investor by putting money into memecoins.  You are a crypto degen gambling on speculation of token with a goofy animal as the mascot.

There is no formula to winning at memecoins unless you’re the dev dumping on people.

You get lucky.  That’s the formula to winning with memecoins.  There is some evidence that major memecoins might be serving as a high beta play this cycle, but even those are risky and can 40-50% pullbacks out of no where after a big run up.

Does a project burning moons for a banner rental increase the likelihood of you purchasing it?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,2020 guy here and took profits today,2024-11-23 07:09:54,"It has been awhile! June 15th 2022 I switched to buying and not selling my crypto. The rest of that year I rode down the market, and then up in 2023. By early 2024 I was basically out of money to invest. I also did regular posts on what purchases were up, and down, and how Bitcoin was generally outperforming more and more alts through the bear market. 

I also shared throughout 2023 my plans I was making on profit taking and trying to reduce risk for myself while also trying to capture those really high gains. It was a ""buy low and sell early"" strategy. Meaning, that when I get to the point of feeling really greedy I should have probably sold more than half my alts. 

First rule that applied across the board for my 25 coins was if any ever reached a 10x, or 900% ROI, then if I hadn't already done so I MUST take back my full principle amount. 

Well today I took back my principle in its entirety on SOL with just shy of 10% of my holdings. So a little profits as well. 

To everyone who survived the bear market and has been here since the last bull run: congratulations! Aren't you all really excited right now? 

To all the newer people, take a long-term view at this. You could get lucky and have an altcoin go to moon, you might pick a project and only be up 300% in 6 months. Try to have a plan. Try to take back your principle. Wipe out your debt. Keep an emergency fund that is readily available. 

If the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill gets passed (which, every level of government involved in the process is majority pro-Bitcoin) then this bullrun might be truly bananas. Capture those gains people, don't let them fall away from you. ",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

* $100 Link before $100k Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is edging $100K none of the alts are close to their 2021 target. Hell somehow Doge is the closest of all of those at 40% while others alts are barely 6% (looking at you ALGO) of their 2021 $100k BTC target.

With this new cycle new bull targets are already being set up -

* I believe ETH will hit $10k before Bitcoin hits $300k
* I believe Algo will hit $1 before Bitcoin hits $300k

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Could 2025 be the year crypto go mainstream?,2024-11-23 12:11:44,"Since the birth of crypto in 2009/10, there’s been several key events that has affected its adoption with major ones been:

1. Hacks and fraud
2. Centralization
3. Scalability and Complexity: most network and chain at that time were reliant on PoW consensus mechanism (esp Bitcoin and Ethereum) which affected mass accessibility.
4. Regulatory landscape

Within this 14 years period, 2022 and 2024 stands out as the most significant for contrasting reasons:

* 2022 witnessed the period of highest amount of fraud (an estimated $2.57 billion of users fund was lost to hacks and fraudulent schemes during this period), black swans and regulatory backlash resulting in the fall of FTX, Celsius, 3AC, TerraLuna, Voyager, the high-flying NFT market and a few others. 
   * These incidents birthed a more amplified need for better regulatory framework. Several high GDP countries like the US, China and some EU countries began outlawing crypto. 
   * In response to this, the crypto market had its worst bear during this period with a dip below the $1 trillion market cap and a 'fear & greed index' below 6. 
   * Most crypto assets saw their lowest low in this period with BTC ($18k), ETH ($800), SOL ($11) and others.

* 2024 saw the introduction of scalable chains and networks like the L2s, use of blobs, upgrades to DAGs etc. 
   * With L2s, Arbitrum and ZK tech became scalability powerhouse in the Ethereum ecosystem leveraging the highly liquid ecosystem. 
   * Solana’s fire-dancer upgrade saw network adoption soar too. 
   * Then, the BTC spot ETF (with the options market already begun in Q4 2024) factor enters the debate seeing a multiple approval and halving set a new adoption race (attracting mainstream financial actors into crypto). 

However, one of the 4 major factors remain prevalent heading into Q4 of 2024 (regulatory landscape) but has already seen significant sway of sentiment with the: 

* outcome of the 2024 US Presidential elections, 
* upcoming resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler
* court ruling of BTC as a legal asset in China
* adoption and use of MiCA (EU crypto regulatory framework) begining from December 30, 2024
* impending approval of ETH and SOL spot ETFs

Also, the introduction of BTCfi and Ethereum restaking might open the crypto ecosystem to more institutional investors heading into 2025.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been following the crypto space for a while now and have made small investments in some of the well-known coins.

That said, I’m curious—what do we really expect for the future of crypto? Is this still uncharted territory?

It feels like crypto isn’t comparable to something like the S&P 500, where you can invest and reasonably expect solid returns over a decade. Is it more of a gamble to invest in something purely digital?

Honestly, I’m just trying to understand what these coins truly represent. Take Dogecoin, for example—Elon Musk hyped it up, skyrocketed its value, and then it crashed, leaving many people with significant losses. Sure, some got rich early on, but at what cost to others?

What’s your honest take—can crypto be a legitimate long-term investment, or is it just speculation?

I’ve been holding Loopring (LRC) since 2021, and I can’t help but notice that while other cryptos are seeing some solid gains in the current market, LRC isn’t really rallying the same way. Back when I bought in, the hype around Layer 2 solutions and Loopring’s potential to revolutionize decentralized trading had me convinced it was a solid bet.

But now, with so much competition in the Layer 2 and DeFi space—Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and more—I’m wondering if LRC is falling behind. It doesn’t seem to be capturing the same momentum as these other projects.

What’s your take? Is Loopring still a strong long-term hold, or has it been outpaced by newer tech and better marketing? Do you think the project still has the potential to deliver on its vision, or is it time to reconsider?

I said to myself ""Would you trust Kermit with your money?"" and my answer was ""No. I would not.""

So if MSTR crashes next week I will have avoided losing a ton of cash because Saylor sounds like Kermit, and if I try to claim that I dodged that bullet because I'm a savvy investor, you can refer me back to this post.

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

I wanted to reach out and apologize for removing my recent post about AMBER256. Upon reflection, I realized that I currently lack the necessary expertise to develop a robust cryptographic algorithm. My intention was never to spread an unsound or insecure algorithm, and I believe it's important to prevent the dissemination of potentially flawed cryptographic methods.

Before I revisit this project, I plan to dedicate significant time to studying existing implementations and understanding possible attacks. My goal is to ensure that any future contributions I make are both meaningful and secure.

I am sincerely sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. I also want to thank everyone who offered support and constructive feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and I appreciate your understanding.

Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to engaging with the community again once I have gained more knowledge in this field.",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893
Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm…

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Proof of Possession: Does a Schnorr Signature done with the sum of 2 Elliptic Curve private keys prove possession of the 2 individual keys?,2024-10-24 10:57:36,"G is the Generator of a Discrete Log Hard Elliptic Curve Group.

2 Private keys x1 & x2, corresponding Public Keys P1 = x1G & P2 = x2G.

Now P = P1 + P2 is also a public key with corresponding private key x = x1 + x2.

If I sign (Schnorr Signature) with x, does it only prove possession of the private key corresponding to P or does it also prove possession of the 2 individual public keys x1 & x2? Or if not proof of possession of both x1 & x2, does it atleast prove something more than just x?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-25 00:56:22.825893

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ?

I am working on a lattice system based on the ISIS problem. ChatGPT keeps thinking this is a terrorist form of cryptography, but it's just inhomogeneous short integer solution.  With that out the way, I'm wondering about short secret generation. I've become partial to using a Gaussian distribution to sample from a set of integers. It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations? 

What's the deal?

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past.

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?
