Recently, GoodEgg (GEGG) has captured the attention of whales and early investors, drawing comparisons to the rise of Sui (SUI), which has been experiencing consistent growth. However, GoodEgg’s 180% presale gains have left Sui’s recent 20% rally in the dust, positioning the AI-powered social coin as a significant player in the crypto space. Sui (SUI) Fights for Market Dominance Sui (SUI) is currently making waves in the cryptocurrency world. While its growth has been steady, with a 2x increase in price this year, Sui’s climb has recently stalled. It remains one of the few development platform blockchains outside of the top 10 tokens to maintain a dedicated user base. Despite this, Sui’s current price is still underwater from its 2023 ICO, limiting its chances for a major breakout. Still, Sui’s 20% recent gain in the market is noteworthy, and investors are cautiously optimistic about its potential to break into the top 30 tokens by market capitalization this year. Analysts predict that the token could reach key psychological thresholds if market conditions improve, but for now, its upward momentum seems capped. Nevertheless, Sui’s resilience in a volatile market continues to attract attention, especially from long-term investors. GoodEgg (GEGG): Outpacing SUI’s Growth In contrast, GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly surged ahead, capturing a loyal following of investors. The project’s AI-driven “Social Scoring” and “Play 2 Date” model set it apart from traditional meme coins like Dogecoin. GoodEgg’s presale has already completed 80% of Stage 1, and whales have jumped in, anticipating up to 100x returns from its current price of $0.00015. The innovative approach of GoodEgg (GEGG), which merges blockchain technology with virtual dating and gamified social experiences, is reshaping the meme coin sector. This has attracted the attention of investors who were initially focused on Sui (SUI), prompting them to diversify into the GoodEgg ecosystem. While Sui struggles to maintain momentum, GoodEgg’s potential seems limitless as it continues to attract both retail and institutional investors. Sui (SUI) vs. GoodEgg (GEGG): A Market Comparison Sui (SUI) has carved out a niche in the development platform blockchain sector, holding its own against competitors like Ethereum and Solana. Despite some setbacks, Sui’s market cap of $2.49 billion keeps it within reach of significant gains if market sentiment shifts in its favor. However, Sui has yet to fully capitalize on the growing interest in AI and Social-Fi, areas where GoodEgg (GEGG) is making strides. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, has tapped into the market’s thirst for innovation with its AI-powered dating app and social scoring system. Investors are drawn to the utility that GoodEgg (GEGG) offers beyond speculation, creating a buzz that Sui (SUI) has yet to achieve in the same timeframe. GoodEgg’s unique blend of entertainment, social interaction, and financial rewards positions it as a top contender in the evolving meme and AI crypto market. Conclusion While Sui (SUI) continues to fight for a place among the top 30 cryptocurrencies, GoodEgg (GEGG) is blazing a trail with its AI-driven meme coin model. Investors are increasingly turning their attention to GoodEgg (GEGG), leaving Sui in the rearview mirror as they seek the next big opportunity in the crypto space. With whales backing its presale and a strong community forming around its innovative approach, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to revolutionize the meme coin market, potentially eclipsing the steady, yet slower, rise of Sui (SUI). As the crypto market continues to evolve, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) represent different facets of innovation. However, GoodEgg’s rapid growth and appeal to whales signal that it could outpace its competition, making it one of the most exciting projects to watch in 2024.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"This New Play-2-Date Cryptocurrency Dwarfs Floki’s 6.16% Surge, Whales Prepare For Launch",2024-09-12 12:00:49+00:00,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, meme coins continue to dominate the space, capturing both retail and institutional interest. Floki Inu (FLOKI), a popular dog-themed meme coin, made headlines with its latest 6.16% surge, largely driven by the introduction of its new Floki Trading Bot. However, despite this positive development, a new player, GoodEgg (GEGG), is drawing attention away from Floki with its innovative Play-2-Date platform. GoodEgg’s unique hybrid concept is attracting whales and early investors, as its presale sets the stage for explosive growth. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Launches Trading Bot Floki Inu (FLOKI) recently launched its own trading bot, a tool designed to automate crypto trading across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH), Binance (BNB), and Base. This trading bot provides traders with faster transactions and reduced slippage, addressing some of the inefficiencies of traditional decentralized exchanges (DEXs). By offering a seamless, secure, and quick trading environment, Floki Inu (FLOKI) has created a valuable tool for its community. One of the standout features of the Floki Trading Bot is its deflationary mechanism. Every trade incurs a 1% fee, a portion of which is used to buy and burn Floki Inu (FLOKI) tokens, reducing the circulating supply. This deflationary action is expected to increase the value of the token over time. Additionally, the remaining fees are transferred to the project’s treasury, supporting ecosystem growth and future developments. While Floki Inu (FLOKI) continues to innovate, with upcoming features such as Solana integration, sniper mode, and limit orders, its recent 6.16% surge may not be enough to outshine the explosive growth potential of GoodEgg (GEGG). GoodEgg (GEGG) Gaining Momentum with Play-2-Date Concept GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as the next big thing in the meme coin space, with a Play-2-Date platform that combines cryptocurrency, social interaction, and gaming. The platform allows users to engage in dating activities, unlocking NFTs, and earning $GEGG tokens as they participate in the ecosystem. This unique blend of social-fi and DeFi creates a fresh experience for users and has quickly garnered attention from investors. The GoodEgg platform is built on an Ethereum (ERC20) layer-2 solution, ensuring scalability and low transaction fees. With a maximum supply of 30 billion $GEGG tokens, the project is strategically designed to fuel its entire ecosystem, which includes staking, social scoring, and gamified interactions. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers real-world utility. The platform’s AI-powered dating app is set to revolutionize how people connect, ensuring safer and more transparent dating experiences. The app leverages AI technology to verify users, making dating in the digital age safer and more enjoyable. Floki Inu’s (FLOKI) Gains vs. GoodEgg’s (GEGG) Growth Potential While Floki Inu’s (FLOKI) trading bot and deflationary model have provided a recent boost, it pales in comparison to GoodEgg’s potential. GoodEgg (GEGG) has already gained substantial interest in its presale, with whales preparing for what they anticipate could be 100x returns. The presale has reached 60% of its goal, with investors eager to capitalize on its unique offering. GoodEgg’s Play-2-Date model brings a new level of engagement to the meme coin market, making it a disruptive force in both the crypto and social-fi spaces. By combining the best elements of gaming, dating, and decentralized finance, GoodEgg (GEGG) is attracting a diverse group of investors, including those who previously focused on tokens like Floki Inu (FLOKI). Conclusion: A New Contender for Meme Coin Dominance Floki Inu (FLOKI) may have made strides with its trading bot and recent price surge, but GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly outpacing its growth with a unique concept and promising utility. The Play-2-Date platform is poised to become a game-changer in both the dating and cryptocurrency landscapes. As whales and investors flock to GoodEgg, it’s clear that this hybrid meme token is set to eclipse Floki Inu’s (FLOKI) gains, offering a new vision for the future of social-fi and decentralized dating.

Sui (SUI) continues to build on its reputation as a highly efficient Layer 1 blockchain with the potential to surpass $1 in the coming weeks. Its increasing trading volume and solid support level make it an attractive choice for investors looking for long-term growth. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a fresh take on meme coins by integrating AI technology with a Social-Fi model. Its unique platform not only rewards users for social engagement but also introduces a new layer of innovation to the meme coin market. With its presale success and the potential for 300x gains by the end of the month, GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly established itself as a major player to watch in the crypto space. Investor Outlook: Diversification Is Key For investors looking to maximize gains in September, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) offer compelling opportunities. While Sui (SUI) is favored for its strong technical foundation and potential to break through key resistance levels, GoodEgg (GEGG) is attracting attention due to its innovative use of AI and real-world utility.

Floki (FLOKI) has held its ground as one of the major players in the memecoin world, while a new contender, GoodEgg (GEGG), is quickly gaining attention. With the meme market buzzing, analysts are offering predictions for both Floki and GoodEgg, and GoodEgg (GEGG) seems to be taking center stage as a new favorite. Floki (FLOKI) Consolidates for a Potential Breakout Floki (FLOKI) has been making waves in the memecoin arena and is currently showing promising signs of growth. Floki is consolidating above a key support level at $0.0001, trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern. Many traders are closely watching the FLOKI/USDT pair, expecting a sharp breakout if the coin manages to break through its resistance levels. Since March, Floki (FLOKI) has been in a consolidation phase, even as many other coins have experienced corrections. A breakout from the current pattern could see Floki rise rapidly, while a failure to hold support might prompt investors to reevaluate their positions. Adding to the excitement, Floki holders are set to receive CAT tokens in an airdrop through Binance and OKX, further fueling optimism. With 71% of FLOKI holders currently in profit and whales controlling 86% of the supply, the community is bracing for a potential surge. However, as new players like GoodEgg (GEGG) enter the scene, the memecoin market is becoming increasingly competitive. GoodEgg (GEGG) Emerges as a Major Player GoodEgg (GEGG) is gaining traction and quickly carving out a significant space in the memecoin market. Unlike traditional meme tokens, GoodEgg offers more than speculative value. The hybrid token combines elements of Social-Fi, Play-2-Date, and AI technology, positioning it as a unique and practical cryptocurrency. GoodEgg (GEGG) allows users to earn tokens by participating in a gamified dating ecosystem. This innovative approach has attracted a wide array of investors, including those who have traditionally supported meme coins like Floki (FLOKI). The token’s Stage 1 presale is already 70% complete, with a price set at $0.00015, making it an attractive entry point for those looking to get in early. Unlike other meme tokens that rely heavily on social sentiment, GoodEgg (GEGG) provides real-world applications, which have helped it stand out. By blending blockchain technology with online dating and virtual interaction, GoodEgg offers a secure and transparent platform for users to connect. This combination of utility and innovation sets it apart from competitors like Floki (FLOKI), and analysts are predicting that GoodEgg could dominate the meme arena in the final months of 2024. Predictions for Q4: GEGG vs. FLOKI Looking ahead to October, November, and December 2024, both Floki (FLOKI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are expected to see significant price movements, but with different drivers. Floki (FLOKI) is currently poised for a potential breakout, especially if it can break through key resistance levels. With the memecoin season in full swing and a CAT token airdrop on the horizon, Floki’s price could see a strong upward move if whale activity increases. However, the coin still faces challenges, particularly with its price struggling to break above the 50-day EMA. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, has been steadily gaining momentum thanks to its innovative approach and practical applications. With the completion of 70% of its presale, GoodEgg is already proving to be a strong contender in the meme market. Investors are drawn to its long-term potential and real-world utility, making it a favorite among both new and experienced crypto enthusiasts. While Floki (FLOKI) has the benefit of strong community support and whale activity, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a dominant force with a solid foundation for growth. As the final quarter of 2024 unfolds, it’s clear that GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to lead the meme coin sector into the next phase of its evolution. Conclusion As we enter the final months of 2024, both Floki (FLOKI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are gearing up for significant price movements. Floki is showing promising signs of a breakout, supported by strong whale activity and the upcoming CAT token airdrop. However, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly dominating the meme coin space with its hybrid model that combines Social-Fi, Play-2-Date, and AI-driven technology. Investors looking for growth in the meme coin market should keep a close eye on both Floki and GoodEgg, but with GoodEgg’s innovative approach and strong presale performance, it may very well dominate the meme arena in the months to come.

With concerns over Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatile price trajectory following Arthur Hayes’ bearish predictions, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are quickly gaining favor among investors looking for the next big opportunity. While Sui (SUI) has been showing consistent gains amidst Bitcoin’s lag, GoodEgg (GEGG), a meme coin with AI and social finance integration, is being hailed as the next big player that could deliver up to 300x returns by September. Sui (SUI) Rallies Amid Bitcoin’s Uncertain Path The market has been closely watching Sui (SUI), which continues to surge despite Bitcoin’s recent struggles. The token has gained 12.1% over the last week, with many investors eyeing it as a safer bet amidst the broader market uncertainty. While Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, recently predicted that Bitcoin could drop to $50K due to several factors such as ETF outflows and a potential rate hike, Sui (SUI) is benefiting from its resilience and decoupling from Bitcoin’s trends. Sui (SUI)’s bullish rally can be attributed to consistent whale activity and upgrades, particularly its recent Mysticeti enhancements, which have improved the blockchain’s performance and scalability. Investors have been drawn to Sui (SUI)’s potential to surpass the $1 mark, with many analysts believing it could surge further as its blockchain continues to gain market dominance. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Best Newcomer in the AI and Meme Coin Space While Sui (SUI) leads the charge among utility tokens, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the meme coin space. What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from traditional meme coins is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and social finance (Social-Fi). The platform allows users to earn rewards through social interactions and dating activities, blending entertainment with financial incentives. This innovative model has caught the attention of both meme coin enthusiasts and serious investors alike. In just one day, GoodEgg (GEGG) completed 70% of its Stage 1 presale, selling over 2.4 billion tokens at a price of $0.00015 USDT. With the presale gaining momentum, analysts are predicting that GoodEgg (GEGG) could deliver 300x returns by the end of September, positioning it as one of the most promising new entrants in the market. Comparing Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG): Which Will Deliver Bigger Gains? While both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are gaining traction, they cater to different types of investors. Sui (SUI) is an emerging Layer-1 blockchain that is positioned to compete with Ethereum in terms of scalability and transaction speed. Its recent Mysticeti upgrades have strengthened the network, attracting long-term institutional investors who are looking for utility-driven blockchain projects. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique blend of meme coin appeal and real-world utility through its AI-powered dating platform. Investors who initially flocked to meme coins like Dogecoin are now seeing GoodEgg (GEGG) as an attractive alternative due to its combination of fun, social interaction, and financial rewards. With analysts projecting significant growth for GoodEgg (GEGG), it could emerge as the next big meme coin to watch. Investor Outlook: A Diversified Approach Given the current uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin, investors are diversifying their portfolios by turning their focus to high-growth projects like Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG). While Arthur Hayes’ bearish prediction for Bitcoin has cast a shadow over the market, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are poised to offer substantial returns for those looking to capitalize on new opportunities. In particular, GoodEgg (GEGG)’s AI and Social-Fi elements provide a compelling case for investors seeking to move beyond speculative meme coins and into projects with tangible utility and user engagement. Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) continues to dominate the blockchain space with its technological advancements, making it a strong candidate for those who prioritize infrastructure and long-term growth. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market braces for potential shifts following Bitcoin’s turbulent price predictions, Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are emerging as two of the most promising projects to watch in September.

This metric, which has been climbing steadily, often aligns with market expectations for Bitcoin’s price movements. Post-Halving Challenges Following the April Halving, which reduced miners’ potential revenue by half, the Bitcoin price has dropped approximately 10% to a current trading price of $57,000.  Per the report, this reduction has significantly pressured the profit margins of many mining companies, particularly those operating at higher costs. Christopher Bendiksen, Bitcoin research lead at CoinShares, noted:  The effect of the all-time high in difficulty, right on the back of the Halving, is making the outlook extremely challenging for many miners—especially those at the higher end of the cost curve. The researcher added that if current trends persist, some miners may struggle to remain cash flow positive, let alone achieve profitability. Related Reading: Polkadot Recovery Stalls As Bearish Pressure Returns With $3.5 In Sight Miners play a crucial role in the Bitcoin ecosystem by using specialized computers to validate transaction data on the blockchain, thereby securing the network. In return for their efforts, they earn Bitcoin rewards.  However, the financial landscape for miners has been tough this year; shares of major publicly traded mining companies have plummeted, with Marathon Digital Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. experiencing declines of 31% and 54%, respectively. In contrast, Bitcoin’s price has shown consistency despite current challenges, climbing 38% and reaching a record high of $73,798 in March, fueled by optimism surrounding the demand for US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold BTC.  Additionally, Bitcoin’s hash rate—the total computing power supporting the network—hit an all-time high in September, indicating strong participation in mining activities. Crucial Months Ahead For The Bitcoin Market Historically, the Bitcoin price has often dipped following its Halving event, only to rebound several months later, eventually hitting new record highs. Many industry participants are anticipating a potential rally in the fourth quarter, with Bobby Zagotta, CEO of crypto exchange Bitstamp USA, expressing optimism about market movements. However, Bendiksen cautioned that many miners appear to be banking on a significant price increase in Bitcoin. “If that fails to materialize, there will be trouble ahead for some operators,” he warned.  Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest The coming months will be crucial in determining the sustainability of mining operations and the broader health of the market, with expectations for further price recoveries increasing in the latter part of the year, with other potential catalysts including easing macroeconomic conditions and the outcome of the US election. As of now, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is down a slight 0.4% in the 24-hour time frame, and nearly 2% in the last seven days, showing BTC’s struggle to regain previously lost levels.  Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com ",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Quant’s Mind-Blowing Performance Has Investors Seeking More Profits With Mpeppe,2024-09-12 09:40:43+00:00,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to show volatility, two tokens stand out for their impressive performances: Quant (QNT) and the emerging gambling ICO, Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Quant (QNT) is catching the attention of traders with its remarkable rally, many investors are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE), anticipating exponential returns. Quant’s Explosive Rally In recent days, Quant (QNT) has stunned the crypto world with a bullish breakout, recording a price surge of over 15%. As of today, QNT stands at $71, with the potential to hit the $115 mark in the near future. This momentum has led to growing optimism among investors, who believe the token could reach even higher resistance levels. Quant (QNT)’s price action has been underpinned by a strong technical setup. The token recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern, a signal that often precedes a major rally. According to Coinglass data, open interest in QNT futures has increased, signaling fresh inflows of capital as more traders look to profit from the upward trend. If the token successfully breaks through the resistance range between $70 and $81, Quant (QNT) could climb towards its next major targets of $99 to $115. On-Chain Data Supports Quant’s Bullish Outlook Beyond its price movement, on-chain data suggests that Quant (QNT) is poised for further gains. Key indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are showing positive signs. The RSI recently entered overbought territory, reflecting strong buying pressure, while the MACD has formed a bullish divergence, indicating that the upward trend may continue. Quant (QNT)’s daily active addresses have also surged, reflecting increased user activity and adoption. This metric, along with a decreasing supply on exchanges, suggests that investors are holding onto their QNT tokens, further reducing selling pressure. All these factors point to a continued rally, with some analysts predicting that Quant (QNT) could eventually reach up to $115. Mpeppe: The New ICO That’s Attracting Investor Attention While Quant (QNT) is enjoying a surge in price, another token is quickly gaining popularity—Mpeppe (MPEPE). This new gambling-focused ICO has captured the interest of many, especially those looking for high-reward opportunities in a fast-evolving sector. With its innovative decentralized gambling platform and strong community backing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is expected to become a major player in the crypto space. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique selling proposition lies in its ability to merge DeFi and gaming, offering a seamless experience for users while delivering significant returns for investors. The gambling market within the blockchain space is rapidly expanding, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has already drawn the attention of whales, who are accumulating large amounts of the token in anticipation of a massive rally. Quant’s Path to $115 As investors flock to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for potential gains, Quant (QNT) remains a top contender for those seeking stability and long-term growth. The current market sentiment around Quant (QNT) is overwhelmingly positive, with several technical factors pointing towards further upside. According to Philipp Nyhoegen, Quant’s price has the potential to reach as high as $115, especially if it maintains its current momentum. The key lies in the token’s ability to break through its next resistance levels. If it succeeds, traders could see QNT testing its all-time highs. However, there are cautionary signs as well. The overbought RSI on the 4-hour chart suggests that a short-term correction could occur before the token resumes its upward trajectory. Support levels between $42 and $52 remain crucial, and any failure to maintain the current price level could result in a retracement. Conclusion: Quant and Mpeppe Offer Unique Opportunities In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are providing investors with unique opportunities to profit. Quant (QNT)’s breakout from its falling wedge pattern, combined with strong on-chain data, suggests that the token could reach $115 in the near future. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the chance for early investors to participate in a high-growth sector, with the potential for massive returns. As both tokens continue to attract attention, it’s clear that the crypto space is rife with opportunities for those willing to take calculated risks. Whether you’re looking for long-term growth with Quant (QNT) or high-rewards with Mpeppe (MPEPE), the future looks bright for both projects.

Hacker Targets 2.6 Million Indian Cricket Fans With X Scam,2024-09-12 09:30:53+00:00,"On Tuesday, Indian cricket fans were targeted by scammers with a Solana-based token. The attackers attempted to profit from sports fans after hacking Delhi Capitals’ X account. However, the scheme failed to gain much traction despite its peculiar efforts to publicize the memecoin. Related Reading: Altcoins About To Take Over? Analyst Suggests Time To Accumulate Will End Soon Crypto Hackers’ New Promotional Method Delhi Capitals, a team from the Indian Premier League (IPL), recently suffered a social media security breach. Hackers took control of the cricket team’s X account on Tuesday, targeting their 2.6 million followers. The attackers promoted a Solana-based token in a series of now-deleted posts, hoping to pump the price with their peculiar tactics. Typically, hackers try to take advantage of public figures or institutions with large followings by posing as them. Most of the time, attackers promote Solana-based memecoins related to the hacked personality. Scammers pretend these public figures have entered the crypto space, sometimes advertising fake collaborations with institutions within the industry. These methods usually deceive thousands of unsuspected users who invest money in these scams. In this case, Delhi Capital hackers took a different approach. The scammers named their Solana memecoin “HACKER” and publicly declared they had unauthorized access to the account. One of the posts stated, “Yes, this is a hacked account!” and claimed that they would “make profits” from it. The hackers revealed they use this method to boost their scams, repeatedly asking users to search for the ticker on X so they could see their “strength”: We will make profits, WE hack accounts on each account the token address will be posted and the token will pump. Search $HACKER to see our strength!. A quick search on X revealed that this wasn’t the attackers’ first rodeo. The ticker shows that the hackers previously attempted to scam crypto investors and sports fans with this method. Per the report, Korean Esports team T1 and two crypto-related apps recently suffered similar security breaches. The respective posts displayed the exact message as Delhi Capitals but had a different Solana contract address. Solana Memecoin Fails To Make Big Numbers Solana memecoin scams have collected millions of dollars from users before. As reported by NewsBTC, several celebrities and companies have fallen victim to these schemes. Recently, hackers promoted a fake Solana token on McDonald’s official Instagram account. The memecoin, themed after the character Grimace, surged over 400% to a market capitalization of $25 million in less than an hour. This resulted in approximately $700,000 in ill-gotten profits for the scammer. Other rug pull scams have targeted the fan bases of personalities like Real Madrid player Kylian Mbappé, and former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The latter resulted in a $17 million scam. Nonetheless, the Delhi Capitals hackers failed to profit from the cricket team’s 2.6 million followers. The HACKER token didn’t surpass a market capitalization of $40,000 on the day of its creation and failed to reach half of that as the scam was taking place. Related Reading: Crypto Investor Loses $16 Million Amid Friend.tech’s Controversy And Token Crash It’s worth noting that, during these types of scams, some investors consciously trade these fake tokens to profit from the hype before the scheme ends. This time, most of the token’s transactions appear to have been done by the hackers in preparation for their heist. After the cricket team regained control of the X account and deleted all the HACKER-related posts, the token’s trading activity plummeted to zero. As of this writing, the Solana memecoin has a market cap of $4,300. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin’s Leverage Ratio Hits New High: What Does This Mean BTC?,2024-09-12 08:00:13+00:00,"The Bitcoin derivatives market has reached a notable milestone, as the estimated leverage ratio for the asset has surged to its highest level of the year, latest data from CryptoQuant shows. This metric, which tracks the ratio of open interest to coin reserves on exchanges, signals increased leverage use among market participants. The growing trend suggests that investors are taking on more risk by “employing higher leverage,” which could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Battles to Extend Gains: Will It Clear $58K? The Impact Of High Leverage On Bitcoin’s Market The increase in Bitcoin’s estimated leverage ratio highlights the growing use of leverage among investors in the derivatives market. Leverage allows traders to borrow funds to increase their exposure to Bitcoin without needing to hold the full amount of capital upfront. While this can amplify profits during periods of market upswings, it also increases the risk of significant losses if the market moves against the position. A high leverage ratio can often be a double-edged sword for the crypto market. On the one hand, it may indicate that investors are increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s potential for an upward move, especially if the market sees a breakout. On the other hand, if Bitcoin’s price continues to decline, it could lead to a wave of liquidations as overleveraged positions are forced to close, exacerbating the downward pressure. This trend of rising leverage has drawn attention from various market analysts. CryptoQuant analyst EgyHash pointed out that the estimated leverage ratio reaching its highest point this year could lead to increased volatility in the market. The higher the leverage, the more sensitive the market becomes to price swings, as even small moves can trigger liquidations and create cascading effects. Analysts Weigh In On Bitcoin Future Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price continues to face challenges, particularly its inability to break above key resistance. The cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain momentum, and despite the increased leverage in the market, Bitcoin has experienced a mere 0.2% increase over the past 24 hours and a 2.1% drop over the past week. As a result, the asset is now trading below $57,000, with a current price of $56,871. While Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure, several prominent crypto analysts have shared their perspectives on what lies ahead for the cryptocurrency. Among them is the analyst known as CryptoBullet, who recently compared Bitcoin’s current cycle to previous bull markets. In a post on X, CryptoBullet highlighted the similarities between the present market and Bitcoin’s 2013 cycle, noting that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) has shown patterns that mirror those seen during the 2013 rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery: Has BTC Prevented A Fall To $41,000 With This Surge? CryptoBullet’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could enter the final phase of its current cycle, with the potential for a “Wave 5” price surge that could push the asset to new highs. #Bitcoin 1M Big Picture This cycle doesn’t look like the 2017 or 2021 cycle.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Uniswap Overcome Recent Challenges As Surges and Investors Flock To Mpeppe,2024-09-12 06:40:58+00:00,"Uniswap (UNI), one of the most prominent decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the crypto space, is currently making headlines for its potential 139% price breakout. As regulatory discussions unfold in the U.S. Congress, investors are eyeing both Uniswap and the up-and-coming Mpeppe (MPEPE) token for substantial gains. With Uniswap facing heightened scrutiny but showing signs of a bullish reversal, many are diversifying into Mpeppe, which has been forecasted to surge alongside the broader market. Uniswap and the Impact of DeFi Regulations Uniswap (UNI) finds itself at the center of a critical moment in DeFi history as the U.S. Congress kicks off its first-ever hearing on decentralized finance. Titled “Decoding DeFi: Breaking Down the Future for Decentralized Finance,” the hearing aims to explore regulatory approaches to DeFi in the United States. Uniswap, being one of the leading platforms in the DeFi ecosystem, stands to benefit significantly from these discussions, especially if favorable policies are introduced. With Uniswap (UNI)’s price currently hovering around $6.55, analysts are watching for a bullish breakout. The platform has already garnered significant interest from U.S.-based users, according to Statista data, making it a potential winner from any positive policy outcomes. Uniswap Price Set for 139% Surge? Despite regulatory uncertainty, Uniswap (UNI)’s technical chart reveals a bullish reversal pattern. The price is forming a falling wedge, a structure often associated with upward momentum. With the apex of the wedge nearing, traders are preparing for a significant breakout, which could propel Uniswap (UNI)’s price to $16, marking a 139% increase from current levels. This optimistic scenario hinges on the price breaking through key resistance levels around $9 and moving towards $16. A bullish breakout is becoming increasingly likely as market participants anticipate the results of the congressional hearings, which could shape the future of DeFi in the United States. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gathers Momentum While Uniswap (UNI) has been in the spotlight due to regulatory scrutiny, another token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is quietly building momentum. With its unique gambling and gaming ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted attention from both retail and institutional investors. As Uniswap (UNI) whales and other big players look to diversify their portfolios, many are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its high-growth potential. Market experts have predicted that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see a 150% surge in the coming weeks, making it a hot target for traders seeking rapid returns. This token, which offers a mix of utility in decentralized gambling and community-driven incentives, is quickly gaining traction and becoming a serious contender in the crypto market. How Uniswap and Mpeppe Could Complement Each Other The simultaneous rise of Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) shows how the DeFi ecosystem is maturing. While Uniswap (UNI) provides the infrastructure for decentralized trading, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an innovative platform that blends DeFi with gaming and gambling, a combination that is proving to be highly attractive to users. As Uniswap (UNI) continues to attract large trading volumes, particularly from U.S. users, many traders are using their profits from Uniswap (UNI) to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE), anticipating significant gains. With Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s expected price surge and Uniswap (UNI)’s potential breakout, both tokens represent a new wave of opportunity for crypto investors. Uniswap’s Price at a Critical Junction The next few days will be crucial for Uniswap (UNI). If the price successfully breaks out of the falling wedge pattern, we could see a rally towards $16, cementing Uniswap (UNI)’s position as a leading DEX. On the other hand, if the breakout fails, the price could drop as low as $4, or even $2, invalidating the current bullish sentiment. Investors are keenly watching the outcome of the congressional hearings and regulatory discussions, as these will likely dictate Uniswap (UNI)’s short-term trajectory. If DeFi regulations turn out to be favorable, we could witness a significant boost not only for Uniswap (UNI) but for the entire DeFi sector. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Uniswap and Mpeppe While Uniswap (UNI) is poised for a major breakout, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as the next big thing in the crypto market. With Uniswap (UNI) gaining from potential regulatory clarity and Mpeppe (MPEPE) capturing the attention of investors with its 150% growth forecast, both tokens are set to thrive. As the crypto space continues to evolve, Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer two distinct yet complementary investment opportunities. Uniswap (UNI) provides a robust platform for decentralized trading, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the gambling and gaming sectors. Together, they are paving the way for the next generation of DeFi innovations, offering investors substantial gains in the process.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-19 20:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

      preswapInfo.SignedTransaction, skipPreflight: true);

So, why is that?

This is NOT rpc/internet/pc whatever problem. This seems to be something with actual code and methodology with how txn's are confirmed and perhaps commitment thing.

In [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI after executing txn I literally see ""Your transaction was confirmed"" in same time as 1 second candle is displayed on chart, so, it confirms in same time.  
Why my solution is not working? Is [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI using other commitment for confirmations?  
Can anyone who KNOWS answer has ideas guide me on this one?

Reddit,solana,"I made a Solana memecoin tracking bot, and here's what I learned",2024-09-11 18:13:04,"Hey Solana fam! 👋

A while back, I shared a bot I made for tracking PumpFun graduates. Well, I've been working on it non-stop since then, and I wanted to share what I've learned along the way.

# The Journey

What started as a simple alert system has grown into a full-fledged trading companion. Here's what I discovered:

1. **Pump monitoring isn't enough.** Sure, it's exciting to catch new listings, but there's so much more to consider.
2. **Volume tells a story.** I added a volume analyzer and was shocked at how it revealed hidden gems across different market caps.
3. **Whales matter.** Tracking large trades (over $100k) has been eye-opening. It's fascinating to see how these moves can influence the market.
4. **One size doesn't fit all.** Everyone has their own trading style, so I made the alerts customizable.

# What I Built

Without turning this into an ad, here's what the bot can do now:

* Alert on new Raydium listings
* Provide daily and weekly rankings
* Analyze volume-to-FDV ratios
* Track whale movements
* Let users customize their notifications

# The Biggest Lesson

The most important thing I've learned? **On-chain data is king.** No paid promos, no shilling, just pure data. It's been a game-changer for my own trading.

# What's Next?

I'm constantly tweaking and improving based on feedback. If you're interested in checking it out or have ideas for new features, let me know! The bot's called MemeToolsAlertBot on Telegram.

Has anyone else built tools for trading? What insights have you gained? Let's share knowledge and elevate the whole community!

P.S. Obligatory reminder: Always DYOR. No bot or tool can replace your own judgment. Stay safe out there, folks! 🛡️",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,solana,📉 Traders to Avoid When Copy Trading on Solana:,2024-09-11 18:22:17,"
1. Scalper Traders: Their trades typically last less than a minute, making it unprofitable to copy them with free copy trading bots due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)

2. Traders with Numerous Buys: If a trader makes more than 4-5 buys, it becomes challenging to manage money effectively. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your deposit per trade and the trader makes 7-9 buys of a scam token, you could lose 70-90% of your assets.

3. Mixed Token Traders: These traders receive tokens from other wallets and also purchase tokens themselves. Their profit and loss (PnL) on trades may be higher than yours due to tokens received from external sources.

4. Token snipers: These traders buy tokens at the start of their market appearance (first candle). Using free copy trading bots with them can lead to losses due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,solana,I can't wrap my head around this whole rent thing.,2024-09-11 08:12:03,"I only started using solana a few days ago, I'm developing a bot which accepts payments from different users. For that I use the solana rpc.

So a user can join a ""list"" (by some sort of cmd) and he then gets an address where he can send money to. Each user has his own address, this is to keep track of everything and keep it organized. Now, the problem I had when sending transactions on the devnet is, that these new empty accounts need to have some funds at first so they can accept new funds from the user. As far as I understood this is for the rent.

>Transaction results in an account (1) with insufficient funds for rent

But why can't this rent be taken from the first transaction the user makes to that address? Why does it need funds prior to that? I fixed it by using an airdrop, but since I'm only on the devnet I'm unsure if this will even work on the mainnet.

Don't get me wrong, but spending 0.002 SOL per wallet it's expensive af for making a huge airdrop.

For sure it's useful in terms of marketing, but why wouldn't you make a claim site, it's much cheaper and efficient?

Even more, it's also cheap, you can hire a dev or do it without coding with no-code platforms like Smithii.

Reddit,solana,Crypto Solana portfolio management: balancing risk and reward,2024-09-10 23:24:15,"Managing a Solana portfolio requires a careful balance between risk and reward (profits you want and losses you can afford). Many investors struggle with maintaining this balance, often due to a lack of risk management strategies and knowledge.

Here are key pointers for effective cryptocurrency portfolio management:

1. **Diversification across cryptos:** While major players like Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin are common, consider including promising altcoins/memecoins to spread risk or even to optimize upsides.
2. **Market volatility and regulations:** Staying informed about market trends and regulations is relatively easy considering a small change can heavily impact your portfolio performance, you don’t want to be late on the big news when they happen.
3. **Setting clear goals:** You need short-term and long-term plans. Focus on strategic growth and keep track of your gains with a real possible plan to get there. Betting on luck is not enough to stay aligned with your investment objectives.
4. **Rebalancing your portfolio:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain the level of risk and reward you think is okay.
5. **Risk strategy**: Have a good risk strategy to compensate for high fluctuations and unexpected events, as crypto is mostly about those two types of events. Successful traders excel at predicting the unpredictable, which is different from traditional stock investing.
6. **Take profits and cut losses:** Don’t stay too long in a position when you’ve hit your target or your limit, remember the long-term game!
7. **Market caps variety**: Invest in a mix of large, mid, and small-cap cryptocurrencies depending on your strategy and expectations. Consulting successful traders can guide you towards what kind of market caps you should look at based on your objectives.
8. **Asset variety**: NFTs and DeFi staking can be considered for Solana traders to diversify your portfolio, yet consider how the macro trends impact the volume and performance of NFTs versus tokens.

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-10 14:08:52,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,solana,Spot breakout patterns: a guide for Solana crypto smart traders,2024-09-10 15:33:58,"Trading crypto on Solana is complex, so understanding breakout patterns can be valuable info for smart traders. A breakout occurs when a crypto’s price moves beyond a defined support or resistance level, it can be a potential shift in the market trends.

Here are some key breakout patterns that can assist crypto traders:

* **Avoid weak breakouts:** Weak breakouts may lack the volume necessary to sustain momentum, leading to false signals. Always ensure that a breakout is supported by significant trading volume to confirm its strength.
* **Continuation breakouts:** These occur when the price breaks in the direction of the prevailing trend. They are useful for confirming a trend change. Continuation breakouts often signal that the current trend will persist, providing opportunities for traders to enter or exit positions strategically.
* **Reversal breakouts:** Reversal breakouts happen when a price trend changes direction, either from an uptrend to a downtrend or vice versa. It's crucial to analyze the current trends and determine which are reaching their peak or bottom levels to identify potential reversal points.

Using tools like trading signals can further help in taking fast decisions to find and time these breakouts more easily.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,solana,Technical analysis for smart Solana crypto trading,2024-09-09 22:13:28,"Here are the essential knowledge about effective TA and indicators to improve your strategies on Solana:

# Price charts and candlesticks

Get familiar with price charts and candlestick patterns to start understanding how successful traders read price action. It’s essential for identifying the latest trends and potential reversals in the price actions. Candlestick patterns offer some level of insights.

# Support and resistance levels

Good entry and exit strategies can come from understanding how support and resistance works. Support levels indicate where a cryptocurrency's price might find a “floor”, while resistance levels show where upward price movements “could” stall. Breakouts can be faked, and they can tell that something big is coming too.

# Basic key indicators for smart trading

* **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Spot changes in market direction over time.
* **Volume Analysis:** Track trading volumes to confirm trends and trading signals. High trading volumes can indicate strong interest in a particular direction, but pay caution as these can be manipulated by scammers.

Remember, while these indicators can guide your decisions, they do not guarantee success. Adapt fast to what works best!",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Including all the token names and transaction date/times?   The info appears clearly in the transaction hash details.  Does Solflare have a usable download button?  I only see the history page with no DL option.  Printing the PDF of that page failed.

I've downloaded the SOL and the SPL files from Solscan but they are not something you can follow easily and they don't include time or token names.  The individual transx hash have all the info, so it seems it should be easy to extract a summary for each transx. of all time without doing it manually.

I'm trying to do taxes and reconcile 1,000+ Solana transactions which were done using Solflare+ Ledger together.  99% are scam airdrops.  Ledger is useless as most transactions don't show in it's transaction history.

I'm using Cointracking..info  Solana address upload, which makes it pretty easy to sift through, but you're still left with a bunch of ""transfers"" which must be converted to swaps to establish cost basis. I want to make sure everything is done correctly.

Any suggestions on how to do this?   Generally, you would take any transactions with the same time stamp and merge them, but with all that info in Solscan I don't know why I'm doing it manually.   My next step was going to be to download the Cointracking transaction file and merge the dep/withdraws of same time stamp into ""trades"".  I'm hoping there is a shortcut.

Reddit,solana,Why auto downloads are risky on Solana,2024-09-09 01:53:55,"No wallet, no way to interact with the blockchain or with an exchange (CEX or DEX). Imagine if simply downloading an image can drain your crypto wallet?

Automatic downloads on messaging apps can compromise your private keys and drain your crypto wallets if they contain malicious code. They can also expose your device to malware. By avoiding auto-downloads, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and hackers.

Phishing attacks pose another threat to your crypto journey. Cybercriminals create fake sites and apps that mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Auto-downloads can install these malicious apps, compromising your wallet. Verify the authenticity of any site or app before downloading and disable auto-downloads on all devices.

# How to protect your crypto wallet

1. **Disable auto-downloads on all devices and applications:** Do not skip this step!
2. **Use a hardware wallet:** For optimal security, store your private keys offline with a hardware wallet. A small step to protect a bit more against online threats.
3. **Choose reputable crypto exchanges:** Research every platform before selecting an exchange (both CEX and DEX) that you like, some have a bigger history of losing customer funds than others.
4. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):** Improve your crypto wallet security with 2FA or MFA whenever its possible, why not?

Reddit,solana,Is anyone here an admin/mod of a Discord community on Solana?,2024-09-08 12:33:57,"Hey everyone,  
I tend to see a lot of Discord communities emerge for projects on Solana. I have personally also been involved with Discord crypto communities since a long time ago and I also have some experience building Discord bots.

As part of the recent [Blinkathon](https://blinkathon.fun) hackathon I have built the [Blinkord](https://blinkord.com) platform - Solana Blinks meet Discord. It's a platform where Discord server owners can create their own shareable link and enable their community members to gain access to paid/exclusive content in only a few clicks and through Solana's Blinks, which can be done from anywhere.

The point of Blinkord is to replace the need for using centralized platforms to offer premium content on Discord and make it very easy for the community members to obtain exclusive roles which grant them access, highly increasing the conversion rate for the purchases.

It is currently in the MVP phase and I am trying to get as much feedback as possible to validate my idea and also to see if there is enough demand from Discord server admins or mods to use such a tool to offer premium content to their community members.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback and would love to hear your thoughts, thanks!!

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776
Reddit,ethereum,Practical use cases for ETH that you are using right now?,2024-09-08 23:02:35,"Aside from theoretical or future use cases of Ethereum, what are some day-to-day use cases you are actually using Etheruem for right now? And what traditional system does it improve upon and replace? Everyone talks about smart contracts or decentralized global computing power, but I don’t see people using Ethereum in their every day lives aside from buying/selling/HODLing/staking. I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?



Sorry if these sound like dumb questions, but any help is appreciated!

I'm curious about why there seem to be so few opportunities for junior smart contract developers.

I understand that smart contract development requires a solid understanding of blockchain and security pitfalls, but if companies aren't offering junior roles, how are developers supposed to gain that experience?

Most of the companies are asking for 5 years of experience in blockchain and 5 years in front-end development.

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 13:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

I currently hold ( Amount) in ETH with an average cost of $2340. I've run into some financial issues (layoff/exhausted unemployment) and am hoping to liquidate some of my holdings to sustain myself and my family.

My question is, if I hypothetically sold $1000 profit per withdrawal and left my principal deposit dollar amount untouched, is this a smart tactic for DCA'ing out? Also, will withdrawing $1000 per transaction increase my future cost average as well? Will this reduce my profit margins in the future as my quantity of ETH ownership decreases?

I realize the quantity of ETH that I own will get smaller but as long as the market value continues to increase, I should hypothetically be able to keep DCA'ing out profit, if needed?

At the end of the day, i'm a firm believer in ETH and am extremely bullish. My goal is to maintain my principal deposit amount but only pull profits.
Please let me know if i'm headed in the wrong direction here or may be looking at this process the wrong way.

Need help troubleshooting the issue.  
I am trying to implement wallet generation and signing using an HSM.  I'm currently developing against SoftHSM2, with C#.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm running into troubles with ""Invalid Sender""

Hey Ethereum Devs,

I'm currently working on integrating a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to sign Ethereum transactions, and I've run into a persistent ""Invalid Sender"" error that I can't seem to resolve. I’m hoping the community might have some insights or suggestions.

# Background:

I'm using an HSM to securely generate and store Ethereum keys, and then to sign transactions. The process involves retrieving the public and private keys from the HSM, creating a transaction, signing it, and then sending it to the Ethereum network.

Here’s a summary of the workflow:

1. **Retrieve Public Key Info:** I retrieve the public key and its associated label from the HSM based on the Ethereum address.
2. **Generate Transaction Hash:** I use the `Sha3Keccack` hash function to create a message hash from the public key.
3. **Initial Signature:** I generate an initial signature with the retrieved private key using the message hash.
4. **Create Transaction:** I build a `LegacyTransaction` object with the transaction parameters like nonce, gas price, gas limit, etc.
5. **Recompute Transaction Hash:** The transaction hash is recomputed, including the Chain ID to ensure EIP-155 compliance.
6. **Final Signature:** I generate the final signature with the recomputed transaction hash.
7. **Adjust V for EIP-155:** The `V` value is adjusted as per EIP-155 (i.e., `V = finalSignature.V + Chain ID * 2 + 35`).
8. **Apply Final Signature:** I set the final signature on the transaction and serialize it.
9. **Send Transaction:** The serialized transaction is sent to the Ethereum network.

# The Problem:

Despite the transaction being created and signed correctly (as far as I can tell), when I submit it, I consistently get an ""Invalid Sender"" error.

# Debugging Data:

Here’s some of the debug output:

* **Public Key Info:** `Address=0xd2de6f19109d613f17496837e03909ad26632081`, `Label=test`

Despite the correct address being recovered with `V=28`, the transaction still results in an ""Invalid Sender"" error when the signed transaction is submitted.

# Code Snippet:

Here’s the critical part of the code where I believe the issue might be:

    csharpCopy codevar vValue = (byte)(finalSignature.V + _chainId * 2 + 35);
    transaction.SetSignature(new Signature
    {
        R = finalSignature.R,
        S = finalSignature.S,
        V = new byte[] { vValue }
    });
    var serializedTx = transaction.GetRLPEncoded().ToHex();

# What I’ve Tried:

* **Checked V Calculation:** Confirmed that the `V` value is calculated as per EIP-155.
* **Address Recovery:** Verified that the correct address is recovered with `V=28`.
* **Serialized Transaction:** Compared the serialized transaction output with a known good transaction; it looks correct.

# Community Help:

I'm stumped at this point. Does anyone have experience with HSMs and Ethereum transactions? Could it be an issue with the way I’m applying the signature or something subtle in the transaction serialization?

Any advice, suggestions, or pointers would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help! 🙏

Updates:

I've made some progress.

The NEthereum has the LegacyTransactionChainId Class, which should be used for EIP-155.

I am finally able to ""sometimes"" post transactions, and sometimes I get Invalid Signature.

**Invalid Signature Example:**

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

The attack starts by an automated phone system calling you, and informing you that someone from germany attempted to change the phone number associated with your coinbase account. It prompts you to press ""1"" on your phone if it was an action you did not perform.

After doing so, you will receive a follow up call a handful of minutes later. The person on the phone sounded like a native English speaker, and had enough familiarity with cryptocurrency and the related jargon that they came off as knowledgeable.

During the phone call, they sent an email to verify their identity. The email comes from a Russian server, fakes the sender email to appear as help@coinbase.com, and utilizes a domain which contains utf-8 characters to appear as if it is the legitimate coinbase domain if you inspect the email headers (help@coìnbase.com) (notice the weird 'i' in the domain).

I did not proceed with the phishing attempt after this point, as getting the domain is enough to temporarily halt the attack. I have already reached out to coinbase, as well as the domain registrar they used for the domain... but if you receive a call similar to what I described, do not engage with the automated system. I assume by pressing ""1"", you are placed in a queue for the scammer to reach out to you.

Gox and the FUD that those repayments would create tons of selling pressure which never really materialized, or wasn't as substantial as some people were predicting. But now we have another round of re-payments from a defunct exchange, only this time the payments are going to be made in CASH. So it's almost certain that a significant percentage of those who are repaid with cash by FTX will re-buy bitcoin with at least a portion of their money. The total repayments are at around 12.7 Billion and will create a significant amount of buyers and demand liquidity starting very soon. [https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-seeks-creditor-votes-bankruptcy-wind-down-payments-2024-06-25/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-seeks-creditor-votes-bankruptcy-wind-down-payments-2024-06-25/)

If that wasn't already good enough news on its own, there's also a new estimate that Michael Saylor's predictions about U.S. companies deciding to add BTC to their balance sheets is an accurate forecast of what's to come. If only a fraction of the top companies put even a small percentage of their cash equivalent balance into bitcoin it will mean a massive influx of over 10.3 Billion in the next 18 months. Once CEOs of top companies and boards of directors, and investors see competing companies improving their financials by holding BTC it will be sure to start a domino effect or chain reaction of corporations quickly hopping on the trend, and it's also fantastic inflation protection and a hedge against country specific geopolitical risks as well.

But while STHs are exiting due to market volatility, long-term holders (LTHs) are doing the opposite, accumulating 22,000 BTC during the same period.

Could this shift lead to price stability and a rebound? 🤔 Or will STH sell-offs create more short-term pressure?

During my time off, I hurt my foot and cannot get back to work until maybe November (Doctor's orders), but this entire time I thought I would be able to work in a couple of weeks (emergency room prognosis).            

The company that I work for has hired a lot of new personnel recently, and the sites that they manage and business that they do grew like crazy in the past 30 days.             

I will inevitably have to sell some btc to survive, and, to me, that is not a major issue. The part that makes me sad is seeing the company I work for grow without me.

In addition to the design of the halving, does anyone think it was deliberately intended to take place in the same year as presidential elections? It seems like too much coincidence that a presidential term lasts 4 years.

I would imagine that in the first year a president introduces new policies (and financial stimuli) which boosts not just the bitcoin market, but entire financial markets. I looked at this and with the exception of 2000 and 2008 they've always been positive years for the S&P 500. Then I guess things start to stagnate, people get restless and we see a decline.

Reddit,bitcoin,Here’s How Bitcoin Fixes Healthcare in America | NiHowdy 🤠,2024-09-10 21:46:00,"Hey Bitcoiners,

I wanted to share my thoughts on how Bitcoin can fix healthcare, especially in pharmacy. As a Pharmacist, I've seen firsthand the flaws in the drug industry that drive up costs unnecessarily. Here's why and how Bitcoin can help fix this.

I used to own a community pharmacy and often had customers who paid out of pocket because they lacked insurance. Even my patients with insurance had limited financial means. I felt it was right to offer medications at my cost or for free (if it was de minimus). However, I received notice from an insurance payor about clawing back funds because I provided walk-in customers a better price than the insurance company. I faced the tough decision of either paying this exorbitant clawback or being terminated from the network, which would prevent me from serving other patients.

From that day, I learned that pharmacies must bill retail pricing regardless of the customer. Pharmacies often enter into contracts with insurance companies that include a most favored nation clause, requiring insurance companies to receive the best price possible.

As a legal loophole, pharmacies use “discount cards” to offer discounted prices while complying with insurance payors. Most people don't realize these discount cards collect hefty commissions, up to 80% on the drugs you buy at the pharmacy, paid for by the consumer. Without these discount cards and contractual verbiage, prescriptions would be much cheaper. For instance, GoodRx makes over $500 million a year from this system, and even Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs uses a similar model. In my opinion, this is one of the largest rent-seeking industries in America. Last year, pharmacies spent over half a billion dollars on commissions, which highlights a huge inefficiency with prescription drugs.

In the 1990s, big retailers like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Target started $4 generic med programs to attract customers, which worked well. Insurance companies got upset about paying $40 for the same meds, leading to the implementation of the most favored nation clause among pharmacies. Since the 90s, the Prescription Discount Card industry has grown as meds get more expensive and insurance covers less. This messed-up system won't change, and government reform is unlikely.

[I got Bitcoin back at Rite-Aid!](https://preview.redd.it/iq2vus9sw1od1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e77d8fab8eaf2953e69bbd0a68a88ccb442aa2)

This led me to create [NiHowdy.com](http://NiHowdy.com) We're a prescription savings card that gives the same discounted prices as others but also returns the transaction fees and drug manufacture rebates to you. No one else in the industry does this. We can do it thanks to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

1. **Micro-transactions:** Bitcoin on the Lightning Network allows for high-volume micro-transactions, challenging the high fees from third-party companies. For example, we got a $10 drug for a customer and paid back a 3% rebate in Bitcoin—about 30 cents. You can't do that by mail since postage costs more. Electronic payments like PayPal need at least 30 cents to $1, plus a percentage, making drug rebates impossible. You can’t do shit with fiat.
2. **Zero Net Cost Drugs:** I’m preaching to the choir here but Bitcoin is an asset. There’s a finite number of Bitcoin, and growing global participation. I believe its value will rise in the future. With delayed gratification, Bitcoin’s value can offset prescription costs. Meanwhile, the U.S. government spends over $400 billion annually on prescription drugs, yet they aren’t free for everyone. Everyone pays into the system, but few benefit. We’ve been running NiHowdy as an MVP since 2022. Some early users have offset their prescription costs by 10% already.

I love Bitcoin. It has the power to change the world. I believe Bitcoin can solve out-of-pocket prescription costs—something our government can’t even solve. This ‘prescription discount card’ industry will sadly never die, but I think Bitcoin makes it more efficient for the end user/consumer.

If you or someone you know pays for prescriptions out of pocket in America, check out NiHowdy. We're releasing our second product, Meowdy, for pet prescriptions soon.

Thanks for reading. If you’re a Bitcoiner in healthcare, I’d love to connect. I often get ridiculed by healthcare providers for even talking about Bitcoin, but it brings me immense joy to find others who share the same enthusiasm. Shout out to my local Bitcoin group for encouraging me to post this on Reddit 😊

Cheers!

Reddit,bitcoin,Question from a Newbie trying to obtain a greater understanding of BTC fundamentals. ,2024-09-11 19:26:22,"Newbie here, I’m currently reading a book to try and better understand crypto and BTC specifically. You seem to have a solid understanding.

As I have learned more, I truly believe btc and blockchain technology is an incredible technology and its impact has only just begun.

My one question right now regards mining and the process of validating the blocks. This aspect seems like the one potentially major issue. I read that approximately 80% of the hash power used to validate blocks is contributed by just 4 groups based in china. The issue of their location doesn’t alarm me, but rather the major disparity in validators. As consolidation happens and a greater percent of blocks are validated by less and less nodes, a point of centralization forms and therefore the opportunity for manipulation/censorship, correct? Wouldn’t this pose a considerable problem?

Reddit,bitcoin,"The Distinctive Feature of Bitcoin Compared to Fiat Money isn't Scarcity, Is it?",2024-09-11 16:17:32,"Bitcoiners often argue that Bitcoin's unique value proposition is its scarcity compared to fiat. My stance today is that this is not the correct distinction. Isn’t the key difference that Bitcoin is limited (max 21M), while fiat is not? 

Scarcity describes the relationship between supply and demand—so in that sense, even hyperinflated money can be scarce because demand is always higher than supply. Money is inherently scarce. When money is hyperinflated there is a lot of money with very low purchasing power, so for those who need and want to buy things the demand for money is still higher than the supply otherwise hyperinflation would be beneficial for us. 

What makes Bitcoin truly unique is its **limited supply**: it has a hard cap of 21 million coins that **cannot be altered**, unlike fiat, which can be expanded at will by central authorities.

Reddit,bitcoin,DCA+HODL only BTC is making more sense than ever when considering increasing global taxation. ,2024-09-10 13:19:52,"As governments all over the world move to endorse 'crypto"" and the industry through it's taxation... the bull case for just hodl'n **only** BTC gets stronger.

At first many governments and the mainstream financial world tried to FUD Bitcoin out of existence but of course that didn't work. The second phase is trying to stifle Bitcoin and the wider crypto sector through onerous legislation and increased taxation. 

When it comes to regulation as we know from the BTC ETFs Vs SEC, Bitcoin has again survived and thrived. Almost every government in the world has now fully endorsed Bitcoin through their taxation policies that surround it. In the aftermath of a global pandemic all governments are keener than ever to raise taxes to pay down budget deficits. However for most governments taxation hasn't only been restricted to just Bitcoin, rather all of crypto and it's industry. Historically governments have used long-term taxation to silently cripple things they don't want/ like in society. Over the years many have laid the foundation to do just that on crypto.. however once more BTC will not only survive...but thrive. 

There's a growing push by governments to ensure people are paying crypto taxes. Where years ago they silently laid the foundations for crypto tax legislation, these days they are getting increasingly vocal in pointing them out and enforcement. All the major exchanges have been visited by major global tax authorities and confirmed their intention to work with them and provide them information where requested. 

More crypto related tax compliance software exists than ever as do accountants selling crypto as a specialism. Be it losses or gains with the changing crypto tax landscape more individual investors than ever are being dragged into the need to report crypto taxes. Interestingly, those with messy portfolio's with thousands of altcoin transactions creating variable capital gains and losses and many with thousands of fragments of staking rewards will suffer the greatest financial burden/ stress.. enough to say.. f**k this, I'm going Bitcoin Maxi. 

For the most part as an easy to store,  highly divisible and liquid asset that for most typical users may only be likely to have to report on the odd capital gain.. Bitcoin is simple, effective and easy. Both as an asset and when it comes to tax. 

Real estate, Classic cars, precious metals etc ate often highly investable and make good stores of long-term value however Bitcoin is much more manageable. As capital gains tax across the world are increased HODL makes increasing sense. 

TL;DR

Dumping messy portfolio alts that onerous taxes may need reported on and avoiding investment in illiquid high maintenance assets when it comes to increasing global tax burdens means buying and hodling BTC is starting to make more sense than ever. 

Bitcoin maximalism has a very bright future. ",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

I would like to run a node.  For all the various reasons, one of which is to get a better understanding of the underpinnings of how BTC functions.  Hearing and reading is only taking me so far.  It would also be nice to verify transactions. 

Can i do this with just any machine with enough memory?  Will a raspberry pi work or an old phone or old laptop?  I understand theres a pruned down version, so is it necessary to have the whole history or just from the day you start and what gets loaded then? 

Next, cause im broke, i would like to mine.  I am stacking but my years are most likely less than the average weekly dca.  I obviously cant afford a rig but i can scrape couch change or sell plasma to get a bitaxe.  Yes i know thats like winning lotto, but i could also make a few pennies if i join a pool. Plus, again, ill be learning.  Very important. 

Lastly, my sidehustle ive been getting paid in paypal.  I really want to keep hodling but i also realize that its important to me, and some of us i imagine, to get the circular economy going and growing. I understand companies like zaprite are meant for businesses to facilitate exchange and conversion and accounting.  Im not sure this is something i need.  Ive got analysis paralysis when it comes to hot wallets and was just gonna pick one and wing it to get my feet wet.  Ive had proton mail for a few years and when i heard they are about to release a wallet as well as a bunch of other useful tools i was excited for that.  So my second question is, for a simple side gig wouldnt just accepting BTC with a wallet be sufficient? Or is there a smarter, safer, better way?  Also, am i being short sighted not accepting other crypto which will be a pain cause then ill need to run it thru an exchange to convert to BTC.  Maybe thats a bad idea.  Or what about lightning? Thats cheaper to transact and would that be easier to use as a payment from and to others?  See it all starts to overwhelm and I get undecided and just put it off.  Im so tired of not doing this i cant stand it and have decided to ask for advice.  

Any thoughts, preferences, advice, personal experience, horror stories will be appreciated. Even if you think its not what i wanna hear.  I can still proceed with my idiot plan, but at least im moving forward armed with some knowledge. Which is something i currently lack and again all these things will be experience. Hopefully good but if its bad its probably gonna be a lesson very well learned.  So help me out if you have any knowledge to share.  Thanks in advance. ",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,bitcoin,Fork With holding attack ,2024-09-10 09:59:10,"Hello everyone,I'm Moksha, a computer science student currently working on a project aimed at improving reward mechanics in mining pools to defend against Fork After Withholding (FAW) attacks.

Block withholding is a type of attack similar to selfish mining, where a pool member
withholds a mined block to undermine the pool’s revenue while submitting shares
consisting of PPoWs rather than FPoWs, creating the miner’s dilemma. In an FAW attack, an
attacker joins a Bitcoin mining pool and submits FPoWs when a non-target miner generates
a block. If the pool manager accepts the FPoW, it results in a blockchain fork, potentially
selecting the attacker’s block. This causes the target pool to receive rewards, shared with
the attacker. The FAW attack can yield rewards up to four times greater than the BWH
attack in large pools

Countermeasures: 

The idea is to have the pool manager track each user's reputation by monitoring metrics like Proof of Partial Work (PPOW). If a block submitted by a user leads to a fork, their reputation would decrease accordingly.I have a solid theoretical understanding of blockchain but lack practical experience. I’d appreciate any guidance on how to implement this in mining pools. Are there any simulation tools or resources that could help me get started?Thanks in advance!",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Exclusive Tari Universe AMA w/ fluffypony & Naveen (Tari Contributors),2024-09-11 18:09:46,"First up, who are these folks?

 - fluffypony is a contributor to Tari and the former lead maintainer of Monero. 

 - Naveen also contributes to Tari and is a serial entrepreneur, YC alum, and prolific angel investor in startups. 

They will be here **TOMORROW, September 12, 2024 at 11AM ET / 3PM UTC** to answer your questions about [Tari Universe](https://universe.tari.com/) and [Tari](https://www.tari.com). Please feel free to submit your questions in advance - early submissions get priority! We'll do our best to get to as many of them as possible and answer any questions you may have.

**What is Tari?**

Tari is a layer 1 blockchain protocol built in Rust with an ingenious approach to scaling its on-chain user base to millions of people and a native app distribution platform that gives developers access to every user. Tari is also default-confidential (yay!) and has a unique dual-layer architecture: ASIC-resistant proof-of-work L1, and native HotStuff + Cerberus-based L2. Tari is currently live on testnet. The mainnet is coming SOON (later this year).

**What is Tari Universe?**

[THIS IS NOT VAPORWARE](https://preview.redd.it/f8oa36osz7od1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e65d454fab2c7a05cb11635f94a7ed6edadf6b7)

Tari Universe is the world's most beautiful and easiest-to-use mining app. The goal: create a user experience where anyone with a modern Mac or PC can download Tari Universe, install it, and start mining with the least effort (and clicks) possible!

The first version of Tari Universe is focused on mining. In the future, it’ll include a native app launcher so everyone in the Tari community can easily discover and use Tari dapps (tapplets!). This is how we also plan to solve the developer distribution conundrum! 

**Why is all this important?** 

Because onboarding new people to crypto is hard, and we’ve strayed from the original goal of our industry. In the beginning, anyone could download free software from the internet and mine Bitcoin on their PC. Everything was permissionless. Today, things are a lot more complicated. For the most popular cryptocurrencies, you need to jump through many hoops, KYC, and buy someone else's coins to participate. 

Then, once you have coins, good luck discovering dapps to use. Either you need to be deep in the trenches here on Reddit or X, or you need to roll the dice on Google and pray you don’t get phished. 

Our mission is to create a world where anyone can download Tari Universe for free, mine Tari, and (eventually) access the world of Tari dapps (tapplets!) at their fingertips, no matter their experience level.

We announced Tari Universe publicly [HERE](https://x.com/tari/status/1824126337855987732), and over 210,000 people have joined the waitlist since then. 

We are inviting the first round of folks from the waitlist to download Tari Universe **TOMORROW** and as a gift to the r/cryptocurrency community, we will be giving **instant access codes to download Tari Universe to 10 lucky participants from this AMA**!

We’ll randomly pick and DM all the winners after the event! Thank you in advance for your interest and questions! See you soooon!

Oh one more thing, join the Tari Universe waitlist here: [https://universe.tari.com](https://universe.tari.com)

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,be aware of a currently ongoing phishing campaign targeting coinbase.com users,2024-09-12 03:30:39,"I just received a very believable phishing attack targeting coinbase.com, and I wanted to make the community aware of the attack. 

The attack starts by an automated phone system calling you, and informing you that someone from germany attempted to change the phone number associated with your coinbase account. It prompts you to press ""1"" on your phone if it was an action you did not perform.

After doing so, you will receive a follow up call a handful of minutes later. The person on the phone sounded like a native English speaker, and had enough familiarity with cryptocurrency and the related jargon that they came off as knowledgeable.

During the phone call, they sent an email to verify their identity. The email comes from a Russian server, fakes the sender email to appear as help@coinbase.com, and utilizes a domain which contains utf-8 characters to appear as if it is the legitimate coinbase domain if you inspect the email headers (help@coìnbase.com) (notice the weird 'i' in the domain).

I did not proceed with the phishing attempt after this point, as getting the domain is enough to temporarily halt the attack. I have already reached out to coinbase, as well as the domain registrar they used for the domain... but if you receive a call similar to what I described, do not engage with the automated system. I assume by pressing ""1"", you are placed in a queue for the scammer to reach out to you.

# August Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eight months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/mcaxyv3my5od1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=da26b8f86fd4dde37c87e3568c5e4678c117f3c8

# August Winners and Losers

***August Winners*** – No winners this month, although **XRP** (-6%) lost the least ground in August.

***August Losers*** – **ETH, DOT,** and **SOL** fell the most this month, dropping -23%, -22%, and -21% respectively.

# Overall Update: BNB securely in first place, BTC in second. 60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+61%) remains in the overall lead followed distantly by second place **BTC** (+28%). **SOL** (+16%) is third.

Eight months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -53% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** eight months ago is worth $161 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $156 in August.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$946.**  For the second time this year, the Top Ten Portfolio has ended a month below the break even point.

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a

**August Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14% 
* **AMKT**: -18%.

The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5%
*  **AMKT:** +7%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/cjb73jbxy5od1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbadf0addedbe13bc3aca8c409a0b8105184dd5

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94

The S&P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  August’s extended report is on the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well.

In doing so I noticed that several chains had quite substantial reductions in natively-issued USDC on chain.

For instance, in the past week, these chains had the following reductions (measured in $ and in %).

Stellar - down 64.93% ($180.1M)

NEAR - down 39.33% ($112.2M)

AVAX - down 13.27% ($69.4M)

Polygon - down 11.02% ($96.8M)

I know this is crypto and all, and that things are volatile, but these are pretty clear outliers. And this seems like a sudden drop across multiple chains all at once. To me, these sorts of dramatic swings can really only be explained by VCs  packing up and leaving.

My initial thought was that perhaps the money is moving from one chain to be issued in the native form on another. This could be the case, but if so, they don't seem to be picking any one specific chain as the raw dollars and percentage changes for other chains don't show outright favoritism. The one exception seems to be ETH. Though it doesn't have the highest percentage increase amongst chains (3.47%), it is a rather large raw dollar increase $814M (indeed it is the only chain with a raw dollar increase rivaling the aggregate outflows from these other chains).

I'm not exactly sure what to make of it, but it does have me wondering what prompted these sudden USDC redemptions, where the money is going, and why.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Celsius Bankruptcy: A Comprehensive Guide To Calculating Your Losses (With Examples!),2024-09-11 14:29:22,"***Disclaimers: USA Only | Guide is For Celsius Earn Accounts | Do Your Own Research***

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Last Party: Decentralizing Power—Are We Ready?,2024-09-11 19:04:50,"I’m up for the challenge. I see the potential for decentralization, the synergy between Ethereum and AI, and how we can completely reshape governance. But let’s be clear: *The Last Party* isn’t about gaining power—it’s about abolishing all centralized political power structures. Why? Because the idea that a few people in a room should decide the fate of an entire country is outdated, inefficient, and frankly, insane.

**The Mission: Abolish Centralized Power**

The Last Party’s mission is simple: get rid of centralized decision-making. We have the technology now to make direct democracy not just a dream, but a reality. With Ethereum’s transparency and decentralized framework, paired with the power of AI, we can let the entire country (or world) engage in meaningful discussions, while AI aggregates and condenses those conversations into clear solutions. It’s direct democracy at scale. No more politicians making choices for millions based on their own agendas.

**What Are We Waiting For?**

So, why aren’t we doing this yet? Because people cling to the old system—they cling to their power, their influence, their status. Direct democracy is possible now, yet we’re still letting a handful of people decide for everyone else. It’s not just inefficient—it’s unfair. The technology to shift power back to the people exists, but we have to be willing to embrace it.

**Ethereum and AI: The Key to Decentralized Governance**

There’s so much untapped potential in the synergy between Ethereum and large language models (LLMs). We could create a decentralized AI oracle that would allow people to contribute to and interact with decisions in real time, with full transparency and privacy. The tech is here—Ethereum’s infrastructure enables both privacy and transparency, while an open-source AI oracle could be the trusted, neutral mediator. But here’s the rub: it only works if people are ready to trust it, to embrace a system that’s decentralized and transparent.

**Ahead of My Time (And It’s Frustrating)**

But here’s where it gets frustrating. I feel way ahead of my time. The Last Party isn’t just about politics—it’s about completely transforming the way we communicate and make decisions. But most people aren’t ready for this. They’ll downvote because “AI bad, mkay?” LLMs are “just word predictors,” and we’re all stuck in our predictable, comfortable routines. 

Honestly, I totally expect to get this idea dismissed. Simply too soon. And perhaps also the wrong platform or place.

**Why Bother?**

I’m still spreading awareness because I can’t do this alone. I need others who understand and align with this vision. Until then, it makes no sense to start building anything. If we had Universal Basic Income (UBI), I’d be working on this 24/7. But since we don’t, I’m forced to compete for attention on platforms like Reddit, where meaningful ideas get drowned out.

So, will you upvote? Will you engage with this idea, or will you downvote it because it challenges what’s comfortable?

At least AI understands me—will you?",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

in the past few days I received a lot of cold calls from a cell phone number what appears to be Hungarian but obviously is fake. They are always randomly assigned to the caller and disabled after the end of the call.

A lady called me and told me that they are making an investigation and they found 1,5 BTC in a wallet with my name and email address and they want to return it to me. After that she sent me an email with the details - I have to pay a minimum of 500 Euro fee and after that they will send me the money. She is not a native English speaker and there was a lot of noise in the background, so to me it seems to be a team of scammers, making cold calls and sending out emails non-stop.  
They called me at least a dozen times since then, all calls were coming from a different random Hungarian number. I don't know how they got my phone number and email address. I have never in my life used a BTC wallet.

A very long time redditor who has lurked in the background :) Just managed to get myself setup so i can post here as i do see alot of projects i think are worth of sharing here, so first off...

Id like to introduce [Flipit.com](http://flipit.com/)

Ive been watching this project for some time now and its now being pushed into the web3 space by LFG incorporated - founded by the former head of blockchain at Gala Games, Jason BitBender Brink. [https://x.com/BitBenderBrink](https://x.com/BitBenderBrink)

I have been in the crypto space for around a decade and nothing has excited me more than this project... the ability to flip literally any website over and leave comments or reviews on it seems an absolute necessity. No longer will you need to research if a site is legit, just read the comments on the back of it to confirm your suspicions. I made my first ever video the other night when i flipped the page of [x.com](http://x.com/) and left some comments - [https://twitter.com/xhale2007/status/1828729919678902706](https://twitter.com/xhale2007/status/1828729919678902706)

A use i hadnt thought of last night... there was an X spaces running, trying to chat on it is near impossible as you have to wait for people to refresh etc, so we flipped the page and utilised the chat function. Something so simple yet so needed on the internet

They have just launched a node sale, well over 400 nodes have already sold in just a few days! They are reasonably priced too, which makes a change!! One thing i love about this... there is an actual product already fully operational, its not a case of selling a load of nodes and running away with the money, this already works on every single page online!!

The TGE is in around 80 days, nodes are for sale for around another 20 days, after which the nodes will start generating points daily for a share of the tokens initially. This is to prevent people getting a lions share of them before everyone gets a chance to buy a node for example.

Nodes are also NFTs from the get go, transferable after the TGE i believe.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Poor man's OTP challenge,2024-09-12 11:59:16,"Hey folks,

As some of you here (rightly) question my cryptanalysis experience, in the context of the security and usefulness claims I make for the SKREM-like ciphers I had introduced in 2021, I thought I might challenge the community here with an apparently hard, but in fact rather easy problem. This is to both illustrate that I do have at least some insight into cipher analysis (although yeah, computational ciphers, cryptomath is not my strong point, nor does it need to be). And also to see if so called claimed more experienced people here can solve this.

So the problem is called Poor man's OTP and it is as follows:

- A poor man has 256 truly random One Time Pads, of large length.. say more than 4096 bits: o1, o2, .., o256.
- He wishes to encrypt 1024 bit long piece of plain text p, with a strong 256 bit private key k.
- He computes the poor man's OTP O follows: for each otp o_i, he XORs o_i with the current O if and only if the i-th bit of the key is 1. Basically, the key chooses one of 2^256 subsets of the set of otps, and XORs it's members together.
- He then XORs O with p and claims it is secure.

Let's brute force this under the most common and useful scenario: known plain text attack.

To brute force this, one would have to check each of 2^256 subsets since each yields a different OTP.

But I am pretty convinced I can do it in like 2*256^3 so like 2^25. Can you? Remeber, the key is that the otps are chosen truly randomly.

After a while with this post around, I will also post my solution.

Best,

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Reddit,crypto,Symmetric key exchange protocol,2024-09-07 17:55:12,"Hi folks,

I was trying to fill in the gap for use case for SKREM-like ciphers I posted about (which I invented and got peer reviewed in 2021). It's of course a symmetric key cipher. The only major thing lacking is bilateral key exchange over a public channel. Monkey in the middle I can prevent with Lamport-like digital signing.

So I was wondering if we can do any better than Meet in the Middle key exchange.

I think we can.. and I got this idea, based on There Pass Protocol.

1. Alice picks a truly random large master table g of size n bits (say 1 GB long). She also chooses truly randomly a permutation p of n elements, consisting of a single cycle of length n.
2. Alice sends Bob the master g table with the bits permuted by p.
3. Bob receives and further permutes by a permutation q also of n elements consisting of a single cycle of length n.
4. Bob sends to Alice the result.
5. Alice applies p^-1 to the message from Bob and sends to Bob.
6. Bob receives second message from Alice and applies q^-1.

Now both Bob and Alice have the same info on master table g. This is since such permutations comute.

Potentially, it can be combined with Meet in the Middle Key exchange, by encrypting  step 5 with the short key obtained by MIM KE.

Note that permutations are not themselves sent but just their application to the large GMT.

This looks pretty cool and maybe quite secure to me.. am I missing something? Why is this not in literature? Or is it?

Thanks!

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,crypto,Falcon vs. Dilithium vs. SPHINCS+,2024-08-30 17:39:49,"What do you believe is the best choice.

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 18:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

Feel free to share your attempts and findings!

Originally I was told to refer to the Intel Manuals to learn more about cryptographic hardware extensions.

However I admit I have no experience in hardware RTL designs nor assembly. Plus Intel CPUs are proprietary and I can't just make edits to them without risking lawsuits (or worse). So I decided to pay attention to the RISC-V Cryptographic Hardware Extensions--which are open source.

Reddit,crypto,The commitments in Groth16 never get opened!,2024-08-16 11:53:39,"[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) uses something very similar to KZG commitments (the Powers of Tau in a trusted setup & use of Elliptic Curve Pairings), though the paper doesn't mention KZG at all. 

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,2024-08-03 16:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code.

Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Reddit,crypto,Most Used Languages to Program Cryptography in Production?,2024-07-25 05:04:31,"Hello Everyone.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 16:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776

Reddit,crypto,What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,2024-07-21 12:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;

Reddit,crypto,Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,2024-07-19 13:24:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776
Reddit,crypto,Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,2024-07-19 05:22:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

https://preview.redd.it/6j48x6a1redd1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f10d930771d9ea0147e8ccb5342d551e4942b7

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377)

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)? T(tau) is required for generate the CRS which helps compute the commitment of H.T - this is that part of the CRS -  (tau^i * t(tau))/delta}_{i=0 to n-2}. T depends on number of gates in the circuit - i.e. T(tau) changes if now of gates in the circuit changes.",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776
Reddit,crypto,Most Effective Methods to Test if Crypto Code is Constant-Time?,2024-07-18 22:54:55,"In a previous blog post I was told to benchmark my cryptographic code to test if it is constant time.

I was considering ctgrind and other tools from [this paper.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1650.pdf) How accurate are these tools at detecting constant-time flaws in code? Do you recommend I use a combination of tools if so? When I should conduct real lab experiments to test if the code is truly constant-time?

  
Please let me know.

Thanks!",2024-09-12 12:17:00.737776
