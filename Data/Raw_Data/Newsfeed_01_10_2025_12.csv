Despite the ongoing pullback, some analysts remain optimistic about ETH’s Q1 performance, suggesting new highs are around the corner. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Potential Rebound To $98,600, But Analyst Suggests Caution Ethereum Forming Bullish Pattern Ethereum shredded its New Year gains today after falling below the $3,320 mark. Following the market retrace, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw a 14% drop from its Monday high of $3,744 to below the $3,300 support. During the start-of-year rally, ETH’s price recovered 20% from the correction’s lows, surging to pre-retrace levels for the first time in nearly three weeks. However, the market pullback, which saw Bitcoin fall 7.2% in 24 hours, sent Ethereum to the $3,210 level on Thursday morning. The $3,200-$3,300 price range served as a key support zone for ETH throughout December. After its recent performance, several analysts have suggested the cryptocurrency is forming an important reversal pattern, which could send ETH’s price to new highs. On Wednesday, crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum is forming a multi-month inverse Head and Shoulders pattern in the 1M timeframe. To the analyst, “it’s clear” that the $3,650-$3,760 area is “a major region of resistance, developing just below the $4,000, with price forming that resistance at a Lower High which could act as a Neckline to the pattern.” He stated that “its terminus point is at the psychological level of $3,000,” adding that “any pullback close to the $3,000 level could see Ethereum develop a right shoulder.” Similarly, As Ethereum dropped to the low of the key $3,200 range, Miky Bull highlighted the same pattern, hinting that the $7,000 target “is looming.” According to the chart, ETH’s price could see an 87.53% increase near the $7,400-$7,500 price range, based on the bullish setup. No More ‘Major Retraces’ For ETH? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also shared his view on the bullish pattern, asserting a downswing to $2,900 “will be very bullish” for ETH. The analyst argued it would create “an excellent buy-the-dip opportunity to target $7,000 next!” However, it’s worth noting that the bullish pattern would be invalidated if Ethereum falls below $2,800, where the left shoulder formed. Meanwhile, another market watcher shared the similarities between ETH’s performance at the start of 2024 and 2025, highlighting the King of Altcoins falling below its yearly opening during January 2024 before climbing up the following month. Related Reading: ‘ADA Wave Is Coming’: Cardano Whales Go On Buying Spree As Price Attempts Breakout He stated, “I think it’s really important not to conflate a few days of red price action with high time frame bias. I am firmly of the opinion that this is a yearly open shakeout after some overly eager participants levered up too big, too early. I am very bullish on H1 2025.” Analyst Crypto Wolf considers there will likely be “little to no downside left,” suggesting that ETH could retrace another 4% to 7% maximum before it aims for all-time high (ATH) levels. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,255, a 2.15% decrease in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Is Currently Sitting At 0.21 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the Accumulation Trend Score has recently been looking for Bitcoin. The “Accumulation Trend Score” refers to an indicator that tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors are accumulating or not. Related Reading: Bitcoin Not Reached ‘Extreme Euphoria’ Phase Yet, Glassnode Reveals The indicator calculates its value not just by taking into account for the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors, but also by weighing the changes against the size of the holdings themselves. When the value of this metric is close to 1, it means the large entities on the network (or a large number of small addresses) are participating in net accumulation. On the other hand, it being near 0 implies the investors are in a phase of distribution (or they are simply not buying). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score over the past year: In the above graph, a dark blue/violet shade corresponds to high values of the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score, while an orange/red shade suggests values close to zero. From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score assumed a dark shade during the last couple of months of 2024, implying the whales were participating in heavy buying and helping fuel the run to the new all-time high. Towards the end of the year, accumulation from the investors started to drop and this year, the picture has completely turned upside down as the indicator has dropped to a low of 0.21. Glassnode has also shared the data for another version of the Accumulation Trend Score that breaks down the accumulation/distribution behaviors across the various BTC cohorts. As displayed in the graph, the largest investors in the sector, the “mega whales” holding more than 10,000 BTC, have interestingly been selling since September, with the distribution turning particularly heavy in the last couple of weeks. The rest of the cohorts were buying during the rally, but even they have taken to selling recently. The whales, holders who own between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, are taking part in a particularly strong amount of selling right now.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,UK Judge Dismisses $770M Bitcoin Landfill Hard Drive Case: A Lesson for Crypto Investors,2025-01-10 08:25:04+00:00,"A UK judge has dismissed the long-standing legal case of James Howells, who sought access to a landfill containing a hard drive with Bitcoin worth more than $770 million. This ends the 12-year saga for the IT engineer from Newport, Wales that captivated the cryptocurrency community all these years. Back in 2009, Howells mined 8,000 Bitcoin, which was valued very low back then but is now trading around $94,600, with the stage set for a major BTC comeback after recent price drops. However, Howells’ former partner mistakenly disposed of the hard drive that contained his private keys in 2013, which rendered the funds inaccessible. Since then, he has sought legal action to obtain permission to excavate the Newport landfill. He even offered a share of the recovered Bitcoin to the local council. James Howells Loses 12-Year Legal Battle Although Howells made repeated requests and put forward his proposal for excavation, the Newport City Council declined his appeals citing logistical and environmental concerns. The final blow came when Circuit Commercial Judge Keyser ruled out the case on the grounds of “no realistic prospect” to succeed. He remarked the search as looking for a needle in a haystack and was simply not viable. “Anything that goes into the landfill goes into the council’s ownership,” said the judge. Howells expressed his frustration after losing the 12-year long legal battle, claiming that the authorities had not considered his case properly. However, he acknowledged that the court confirmed his ownership of the Bitcoin. Now, he is left to explore alternative options like tokenization to monetize his digital assets. The Howells case serves as a precautionary tale for global crypto investors. It demonstrates the importance of securely storing digital assets. Cryptocurrencies are different from traditional financial systems and need private keys for access. Losing these keys may result in the permanent loss of the assets.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin’s Current Struggles Could Set the Stage for a Major Comeback—Here’s Why,2025-01-10 08:00:23+00:00,"Bitcoin market performance has faced a challenging start to the year, marked by a lesser upsurge and more bearish sentiment. Amid these fluctuations, insights from CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain shed light on the current state of Bitcoin’s price movements and the factors influencing them. In a post titled “Bitcoin Price Correction: Short-Term Volatility Amid Long-Term Bullish Outlook,” Avocado analyzed key on-chain metrics, highlighting trends that may define Bitcoin’s immediate and future trajectory. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $690 Million As Bitcoin, Ethereum Crash On-Chain Metrics Hint At Bitcoin’s Next Move The analyst pointed out that the ongoing decline in Bitcoin’s price has been fueled by several factors, including uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate adjustments, cautious market behavior ahead of political transitions, and concerns over state-held Bitcoin sales, which historically emerge during correction periods. These elements have combined to push market sentiment toward bearish territory. However, Avocado emphasized that the short-term outlook does not necessarily overshadow Bitcoin’s long-term potential for recovery and growth. Avocado’s analysis utilized on-chain data to assess the possibility of additional price corrections. One of the primary indicators examined was the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (30-day moving average), which revealed a dominance of sell-side activity. Following Bitcoin’s price surge in March 2024 and its recent all-time high, this ratio trended downward, signaling an overheated market. This pattern historically precedes periods of price decline, indicating potential for further corrections. Another metric, the Short-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which measures short-term investors’ profitability, has dropped below 1. This indicates that many short-term holders are selling at a loss, a behavior that has been observed during prior correction phases. Similarly, the Funding Rates (30-day moving average), a measure of market sentiment among leveraged traders, is trending downward. Negative funding rates often precede a bearish market shift but can also pave the way for eventual recovery once sentiment stabilizes. Avocado wrote: While this analysis focuses on short-term price movements, Bitcoin is likely to rebound in the long run and resume its upward trend after completing the correction phase. Investors should remain strategic, avoid reacting to short-term noise, and focus on the broader bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown? Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to demonstrate bearish movements especially with its price now trading for $92,317, at the time of writing down by 3.3% in the past day.

However, long-term market observers remain confident, emphasizing that short-term price action does not alter their belief in BTC’s eventual rise to a million dollars or more in the coming years. Bitcoin To Reach $1.5 Million By 2035 Cryptocurrency enthusiast Timothy Peterson recently shared his projection on X, predicting that Bitcoin is on track to reach $1.5 million by 2035, based on Metcalfe’s Law. This forecast represents an almost 15-fold increase from its current price over the next decade. For the uninitiated, Metcalfe’s Law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users, meaning as the number of participants grows, the network’s utility and value increase exponentially. In Bitcoin’s context, this suggests that its value rises significantly as more people adopt and use the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Rally In Q1 2025 Driven By US Fed’s Money Printing, Predicts Arthur Hayes Peterson is the author of the widely discussed paper titled “Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value”, which uses the law to project Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin, Peterson has long argued that BTC’s global adoption is inevitable. His paper states: Traditional currency models fail with bitcoin, but various mathematical laws which explain network connectivity offer compelling explanation of its value. Peterson has also demonstrated accuracy in identifying key market trend reversals. For instance, he correctly identified Bitcoin’s local bottom in September of last year. BTC To Dip Further Before Bounce? While Peterson’s bullish $1.5 million prediction is music to the ears of Bitcoin bulls, the cryptocurrency’s current price action might leave them uneasy. At the time of writing, over $524 million worth of liquidations have occurred in the past 24 hours, with $136 million in BTC alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off Likely When This Metric Reaches 4%, Analyst Explains Crypto analyst Keith Alan weighed in on Bitcoin’s recent price movement, stating that “this dip isn’t done dipping.” According to Alan, the sell-side pressure is actively pushing the price down, with buyers seemingly waiting for lower levels to make significant purchases. He explained: It’s clear that the sell side is trying to push the price down. It’s not clear if the buy walls are related to the same entity pushing price down, but what is clear is that they have no conviction for those price levels, and some or all of this liquidity could move or spoof. Alan identified $91,500 as a potential support level, with $86,500 acting as a secondary line of defense. He noted that more than $300 million in bid liquidity exists within this range, making it likely that BTC could rebound from these levels. Alan also highlighted that a drop to $86,500 would represent a 20% decline from Bitcoin’s recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,135. However, if this support fails to hold, there is a risk of BTC sliding further to $77,900 to fill the CME gap.  On the contrary, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently emphasized that BTC may be on track to $275,000 based on the cup and handle pattern formation on the weekly chart. At press time, BTC trades at $92,805, down 3.3% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from X and TradingView.com",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

The next major resistance is near the $0.350 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3981 swing high to the $0.3143 low. A close above the $0.350 resistance might send the price toward the $0.3620 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.380 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.40.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Whale Movements Push Shiba Inu Burn Rate To Stunning 4,100% Rise",2025-01-10 05:00:43+00:00,"Renewed investor optimism and interest in Shiba Inu (SHIB) has emerged despite market volatility. This is due to a remarkable 4,100% surge in its burn rate within just 24 hours, resulting in the removal of nearly 21.7 million SHIB tokens from circulation. The cryptocurrency is once again capturing attention in the digital asset space as this extraordinary increase highlights its significant combustion rate. Related Reading: Bitcoin As The New S&P 500 Of Our Time? This CEO Thinks So A Closer Examination Of The Burn Rate The burn rate is an essential metric for Shiba Inu, as it indicates the quantity of tokens that are irrevocably removed from circulation. The purpose of this standard procedure is to establish scarcity, which has the potential to increase the value of the remaining tokens. The most recent surge was predominantly driven by a single transaction, which resulted in the burning of nearly 21 million tokens in a single instance. A reduction in supply of this magnitude can have a beneficial effect on investor confidence and market sentiment. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE$SHIB Price: $0.00002372 (1hr -0.06% ▼ | 24hr -2.13% ▼ ) Market Cap: $13,977,981,987 (-1.97% ▼) Total Supply: 589,257,014,659,157 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 21,709,094 (4100.35% ▲) Past 7 Days: 104,230,574 (86.58% ▲) — Shibburn (@shibburn) January 8, 2025 Still, it’s important to recognize that SHIB’s price did not line up with the notable rise in burn rate. Actually, SHIB’s price dropped 11% over this period, coming out to roughly $0.00002168. This decline in the market value of the meme coin was a result of a larger trend influencing the whole digital currency market that saw over $711 million in liquidations among other assets. Shiba Inu: Whale Activity Increases Interestingly, there have been a lot more whales in the Shiba Inu environment at the same time that the burn rate has gone up. Over 2,000% more transactions involving substantial holders happened, resulting in the exchange of around $750 million in SHIB in a 24-hr period. This rise means that big buyers are either buying more tokens or giving them to other people in response to changes in the market. Future Prospects And Market Sentiment Many members of the Shiba Inu community are optimistic about the future of the coin, despite the present price decrease. The substantial incineration rate is perceived as a proactive measure to increase scarcity and potentially result in price appreciation in the future. Investor sentiment can be unpredictable; however, community members frequently gain confidence in the project’s long-term viability when they witness significant fires. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Fuels $585 Million Crypto ETP Inflows In 2025 The recent increase in the Shiba Inu’s combustion rate stimulates optimism about its future potential; nonetheless, market realities are complex. The simultaneous price fall and macroeconomic factors that lead to market volatility serve as a reminder to investors to be cautious. In the world of cryptocurrencies, volatility are unavoidable, and monitoring both whale activity and burn rates will be critical in determining SHIB’s likely future path.

The price is still consolidating and aiming for a fresh increase above the $2.320 resistance. XRP price is still in a range mode above the $2.25 zone. The price is now trading below $2.350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.3250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it stays above the $2.20 support. XRP Price Consolidates Below $2.40 XRP price failed to start a fresh increase above the $2.40 and $2.42 resistance levels. The price reacted to the downsides, but losses were limited compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $2.30 and $2.2650 support levels. The last swing low was formed at $2.235, and the price is now consolidating. There was a move above the $2.25 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.390 swing high to the $2.235 low. The price is now trading below $2.350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.320 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.3250 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.35 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.390 swing high to the $2.235 low. The next resistance is $2.40. A clear move above the $2.40 resistance might send the price toward the $2.45 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance or even $2.550 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.350 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.220 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.220 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.20 support. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Survival Of The Strongest: Bitcoin Miners Face Tough Choices As Selling Pressure Mounts,2025-01-10 03:30:51+00:00,"Bitcoin journey in the new year continues to demonstrate less upward momentum, with its price recently dropping below the $95,000 price mark. Amid this movement, the market seems to be witnessing a notable trend among miners as they grapple with the effects of rising values and selling pressure. Insights from XBTManager, a CryptoQuant contributor, shed light on the challenges facing Bitcoin miners and the broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Rally In Q1 2025 Driven By US Fed’s Money Printing, Predicts Arthur Hayes Miners Feel the Pressure As Bitcoin Remains Below $100K In a post titled “The Strong Remain, the Weak Exit the Market,” XBTManager highlighted that Bitcoin’s appreciation has placed miners in a “precarious” position. The recent price surge above $100,000 initially brought substantial gains for miners, but subsequent corrections have intensified selling activity. According to the analysis, miners have entered a state where their positions are “extremely underpaid,” leading to significant financial strain. XBTManager wrote: Following a sharp pullback in Bitcoin’s price, it entered a correction phase and rose again to the 102k levels, only to trigger another wave of heavy selling. As Bitcoin climbed to 102k, miner positions, which were in a “fairly paid” state, transitioned to an “extremely underpaid” state as selling pressure intensified at that level. Notably, as weaker miners exit the market, those with greater resilience are expected to persist, potentially opening opportunities for investors. XBTManager’s outlook suggests that assuming the current bull market remains intact, the ongoing challenges for miners could present favorable conditions for strategic buying. MVRV Indicator Hints At Bitcoin’s Continued Growth Potential Another CryptoQuant contributor, CryptoOnchain, offered an additional perspective on Bitcoin’s market cycle. Analyzing the 100-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio, CryptoOnchain argued that Bitcoin has “yet to reach its peak” for this cycle. Historical data shows that the MVRV ratio reached a value of 3 during the market tops in the last two cycles. At present, this ratio stands at 2.14, indicating potential for further upward movement. 100-day moving average of MVRV: Bitcoin has not yet reached the top price of this cycle “MVRV metric reached the value of 3 at the market tops in the past two cycles, whereas it currently stands at 2.14… it can be said that Bitcoin is preparing to move towards the top price of… pic.twitter.com/YlNLQwgE3w — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 9, 2025 The MVRV metric, which helps identify market tops and bottoms, signals that Bitcoin may be preparing for another price surge in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Mixed Signals: Institutional Investors Accumulate Amid Retail Weakness If the pattern from previous cycles holds true, Bitcoin could be on track to approach a new peak before the current cycle concludes. CryptoOnchain particularly concluded by noting: Based on this, it can be said that Bitcoin is preparing to move towards the top price of this cycle, which is likely to occur in the coming months.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Ethereum Price Pullback Deepens: Bulls Struggle to Hold Support,2025-01-10 03:28:31+00:00,"Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,400 resistance and extended losses. ETH is struggling and might continue to move down if it stays below $3,400. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,400 zone. The price is trading below $3,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,300 resistance level. Ethereum Price Extend Losses Ethereum price failed to start a recovery wave above the $3,400 level and extended losses like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $3,350 and $3,320 support levels. There was a clear move below $3,250 and $3,220. A low was formed at $3,159 and the price is now consolidating below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,159 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,300 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $3,400 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,450 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,159 low. A clear move above the $3,450 resistance might send the price toward the $3,500 resistance. An upside break above the $3,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,550 resistance zone or even $3,650 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,160. A clear move below the $3,160 support might push the price toward the $3,080 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

First of all I‘m honest and also benefit from this but you guys need to understand how fucked up this space is and why so many loose not less than everything.

Despite all the rugpullers or SOL influencers who are dumping on you, I lately had some personal contact to one of the biggest what you would call „insider“ sheme. The numbers are shocking and while most traders know aboit them I still think it‘s important to talk about this.

So these guys are working with 50+ devs who all know how to market a coin. They change their wallets for copytraders and just so nobody knows this project will be successful.
After the launch these guys gets onboard to give them a huge launch volume which usually leads the coins to some front pages.
Depending on the coin and market they cash out at 10-100x on every single on of them and then change wallets again.

This sheme just gets crazier everyday because they get more money to advertise all of these and are dumping on the whole community",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Every time I see a so called CTO it’s the same story. “We got rugged but now want to keep the meme coin going because we build a community.” Funny how a community was built in days and how all the accounts seem new. This is because it’s part of a second rug pull that they want to trick new investors. They want to make it seem like there is no risk when in reality it’s a bunch of bundled wallets waiting for the second rug. Even real communities don’t upvote posts like this. But all these CTO’s have hundreds of likes and comments in seconds. Fair warning about the new scam.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,solana,Educational Blog Post | Solana Token Accounts Made Simple: Why Should You Close Them? (Written by RayBot intern),2025-01-09 20:06:53,"**Source:** [https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9](https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9)

On Solana, associated token accounts (ATAs) are essential for managing tokens. But what happens when you no longer need a specific token account? That’s where the “close token account” transaction comes in. Let’s explore why and how you might close an ATA, and the benefits of doing so.

[https:\/\/t.me\/ray\_magenta\_bot](https://preview.redd.it/mrlvvwoqy0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8063f79b43829bc5d71e8607c2639023379f0acb)

# What Does It Mean to Close an Associated Token Account?

Closing an associated token account is like cleaning out a locker at the end of the school year. Once you’re done using it — say, you’ve sold all the tokens — you can “close” the account. This deletes the account and refunds the rent (SOL) used to maintain it.

>

# Why Close an ATA?

There are a few key reasons you might want to close an associated token account:

1. **You No Longer Need It:** If you’ve sol all the tokens and don’t plan to use that token again, closing the account cleans up your wallet.
2. **Save on Rent Costs: Each account you maintain uses a bit of SOL. By closing unused accounts, you can reclaim those funds.**

# How to Close an ATA

There are many tools that can help you close ATA accounts. Here’s how it works:

1. **Ensure the Account Is Empty:** Before closing an account, make sure it has a balance of 0. You can do this by transferring or selling any remaining tokens to another wallet or account.
2. **Use a Cleanup Tool:** Use one of the well-established tools to close your accounts. For instance, go to [Sol Incinerator](https://sol-incinerator.com/#/) (one of the most popular tools for wallet cleanups) and select “CLEANUP.” It will display all your vacant accounts. There are other tools offering the same functionality — do your own research (DYOR).

https://preview.redd.it/mrxz7f3ty0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=687739690238d0d2723a92bc1eae88dad67364bf

The “close token account” transaction is a simple yet powerful tool for optimizing your wallet on Solana. By closing unused accounts, you save money, keep your wallet organized, and contribute to the overall health of the network. Whether you’re a casual user or a developer, understanding and utilizing this feature can make a big difference in your Solana experience.

So next time you spot an empty token account in your wallet, consider closing it — your SOL balance will thank you!

Reddit,solana,Colosseum’s 2024 Investments and Themes For 2025,2025-01-09 20:17:57,"**Source:** [https://blog.colosseum.org/colosseums-2024-investments-and-themes-for-2025/](https://blog.colosseum.org/colosseums-2024-investments-and-themes-for-2025/)

https://preview.redd.it/b6u67k5n01ce1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a96b9488bb6a1f202aa4bc1c546346abb9bb3fab

We launched [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) in early 2024 with the goal of empowering developers to compete, experiment, and build products across a broad spectrum of crypto use cases through our online hackathons. In partnership with the Solana Foundation and numerous ecosystem organizations, we’ve built the largest hackathons in crypto and helped accelerate the rapid growth of Solana’s startup ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/f6354joq01ce1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf37ffc7659f232fb0275d195c444222b7040756

Following each major Solana hackathon ([Renaissance](https://www.colosseum.org/renaissance?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Radar](https://www.colosseum.org/radar?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), we accepted two accelerator batches each with 10+ winning teams. And to date, we’ve made pre-seed investments in 20+ startups. Reviewing thousands of hackathon submissions and working with talented founders in our accelerator program has given us an up close view of crypto's rapidly emerging markets. As the year comes to a close, we’re excited to share our perspective on 12 high-growth verticals where we saw exciting development in 2024, and that we believe will continue to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. In addition, we highlight the hackathon winners and teams we’ve backed who we believe are creating the markets that will drive each category forward.

*Note: Many of the projects mentioned below are currently on devnet, with mainnet deployments expected in Q1 and Q2 2025.*

**Non-Sovereign SoV Assets**

Over the past decade, Bitcoin has proven that a non-sovereign store-of-value (SoV) asset can gain global acceptance and secure a core position within the global financial system. While Bitcoin’s incredible success validated the concept, we believe it also opened the door for additional digital gold-like assets to reach escape velocity and meaningful liquidity in the coming years.

[Ore](https://x.com/OREsupply?ref=blog.colosseum.org) stands out as the most promising non-sovereign asset tailored specifically for onchain ecosystems. Strong community support, thoughtful economic design, and increased liquidity—fueled by “Boosts” on key trading pairs—[positioned Ore well in 2024](https://x.com/mattytay/status/1870887900663169059?ref=blog.colosseum.org). We’re excited to see the core team use these structural advantages to build new products that further its adoption in the broader onchain economy.

**Futarchy**

DAOs have long struggled with governance, often relying on 1-token-1-vote structures that can stifle progress, resulting in a waste of both human and treasury capital. MetaDAO offers a transformative “[futarchy as a service](https://metadao.fi/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)” framework, enabling organizations to make decisions through markets rather than traditional voting mechanisms.

[MetaDAO](https://x.com/MetaDAOProject?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is already integrated into leading projects like Drift and Jito. We believe futarchy will continue to solidify itself as the default governance module in the Solana ecosystem (and crypto more broadly) in 2025—one that overcomes entrenched governance challenges and accelerates dynamic decision-making.

**Decentralized Stablecoins**

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT have achieved widespread adoption, and crypto-native products such as Ethena are also on the rise. However, existing stablecoin implementations often sacrifice censorship resistance, capital efficiency, or both.

A new wave of experimentation is underway, with the aim of creating stablecoins that offer robust stability while also delivering more decentralization, transparency, and higher yield potential. [Reflect](https://x.com/ReflectCX?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Hylo](https://x.com/hylo_so?ref=blog.colosseum.org) represent two of the most promising protocols leading the decentralized stablecoin renaissance in 2025.

**Crypto’s Growth Stack**

As consumer-facing products begin to dominate venture funding in the Solana ecosystem, the need for sophisticated growth tools will increase in lockstep. Just as Web2 startups have grown up around powerful analytics and marketing tools, Web3 builders are now developing their own data-driven growth engines to meet their unique needs.

[Torque](https://x.com/torqueprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is one such product, providing a powerful onchain-native growth platform, enabling just-in-time user rewards based on a wide variety of behaviors. Prominent teams like Tensor and Metaplex already use Torque for targeted growth campaigns. Meanwhile [AdX](https://x.com/AdXso_?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team in our latest accelerator cohort, is building a decentralized ad exchange, granting both Web 2 and Web 3 projects direct access to effective distribution channels.

**High-performance Clients**

Currently, Solana’s network relies on two main node clients: Anza’s Agave and Jump’s Firedancer, the latter of which hasn’t been fully deployed yet. The Firedancer team has taken on the ambitious (and critical) effort of building a new client from the ground up, with a focus on high-performance. While we believe this will be a successful effort over the coming years, we also believe there are sustainable opportunities for monetizing more tightly-scoped validator improvements even sooner. 

[Rakurai](https://x.com/Rakurai_io?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team of experienced engineers from Apple and high-frequency trading, are capitalizing on one such opportunity. Building on upcoming Agave releases, their validator client will integrate an optimized transaction scheduler that has benchmarked at up to 5x the current block rewards and yield boosts of over 30% compared to existing clients. We anticipate a continued increase in competition amongst validator operators, leading to better network performance for apps and users in the years to come.

**Crypto Developer Tooling**

As crypto matures, development teams require increasingly advanced tooling to secure, monitor, and scale their products. In traditional tech, tools like HashiCorp’s Terraform made cloud infrastructure management far simpler and more reliable for engineers. In crypto, [Txtx](https://x.com/txtxrun?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is poised to offer similarly transformative infrastructure—improving security, reliability, and reproducibility of workflows involving onchain programs/smart contracts.

For monitoring and rapid bug resolution, [Tokamai](https://x.com/gotokamai?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has also emerged as a crypto-native equivalent to Sentry, empowering developers to maintain application reliability through every layer of the stack.

**Onchain Yield**

While DeFi has introduced overcollateralized lending, capital-efficient yield remains elusive. The next phase of DeFi will bring more sophisticated yield markets onchain, enabled through true prime brokerage-like functionality and liquid staking fundamentals.

[Asgard](https://x.com/asgardfi?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is laying this groundwork by building a suite of DeFi protocols, including a spot margin aggregator and credit synthesizer. [Pye](https://x.com/pyefinance?ref=blog.colosseum.org), another hackathon winner, is creating a marketplace that allows stakers to tokenize and forward-sell their staking yield—further extending the frontier of DeFi 2.0.

The final team we backed in this vertical is [Watt](https://x.com/wattprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is building a volatility farming protocol utilizing market arbitrage to generate real yield for users and foster liquidity for the ecosystem as a whole.

**Private DeFi Infrastructure**

Transparency is a defining feature of DeFi, yet certain market participants prefer selective privacy. PayPal’s integration of confidential transactions using token extensions for its PYUSD stablecoin highlights a growing demand for privacy-enhanced financial infrastructure.

We believe this foreshadows in a new era of embedded privacy primitives for DeFi. [Darklake](https://x.com/darklakefi?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a recent hackathon standout, employs zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy-first dark pool trading platform.

**Sports Markets**

Sports are rapidly financializing: stadiums are integrating casinos, online betting is thriving, and college athletes are now receiving substantial compensation. Crypto is poised to expand and democratize these markets—enabling direct ownership, unique betting models, and new forms of engagement.

In our newest accelerator cohort, [AlphaFC](https://x.com/alphafcxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is pioneering the tokenization of sports fandom through real ownership of an English football club, and [Pregame](https://x.com/pregame_hq?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is building a new platform for direct p2p sports betting. We're excited to watch both of these endeavors expand crypto’s role in the sports economy.

**Virtual Infrastructure Networks**

DeVINs (Decentralized Virtual Infrastructure Networks) gained momentum in 2024 and we continue to see top founder talent launch a diversity of products in the space.

[BlockMesh](https://x.com/blockmesh_xyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) empowers users to earn passive income by leveraging their unused bandwidth, and is well on their way to building a strong network with over 500,000 extension downloads.  Meanwhile, [MeshMap](https://x.com/meshmapxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is focused on building a 3D AR mapping network. Although mainstream AR/VR adoption is still in its infancy, we anticipate accelerated growth in these areas over the next 1-2 years. Finally, we also backed [DBunker](https://x.com/Dbunker_Network?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is an aggregator and marketplace giving users the ability to participate across many DeVINs.

**Energy Markets**

Rising global energy demand and increasing climate pressures create volatility and opportunity. Southeast Asia, in particular, has seen high demand for innovative solutions to support a growing population with an aging energy grid. We’ve backed 2 India-based teams who are building novel token-incentivized infrastructure to serve this demand.

[DeCharge](https://x.com/DeCharge__?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has deployed over 150 EV charging stations within just a few months, and is expanding to the U.S. in Q1 2025, and [GreenkWh](https://x.com/GreenKWh?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is using battery packs to coordinate off-grid energy—both projects exemplify how crypto can reshape global energy infrastructure.

**Social Markets**

After a 2024 boom in memecoins, founders are now exploring deeper integrations of social media, token issuance, and gaming. The following teams are exploring use cases across a spectrum of community engagement to gamified token economies:

* [Banger](https://x.com/bangerdotlol?ref=blog.colosseum.org): An app that enables users to buy and sell “tweet tokens,” Curators to profit from high-volume tweet markets, and Creators to earn for their viral posts.
* [Peek](https://x.com/peekdotcyou?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A platform that leverages liquid crypto markets to gamify TikTok videos and content.
* [Supersize](https://x.com/supersizegg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A Mini-clip style gaming platform building an onchain PVP game where token communities wager and compete for dominance to become the largest “blob” on the map.
* [Monsters](https://x.com/monsdotgg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A new game for memecoin communities, blending Pokémon-inspired mechanics with high-stakes betting.
* [Teamplay](https://x.com/teamplay_games?ref=blog.colosseum.org) (with Midcurve): A platform for creators to host private gaming sessions and contests, tightening community engagement and opening new revenue streams through a token-enhancing toolkit.

**Looking Ahead**

As we prepare to run more hackathons for the Solana ecosystem in 2025, we’re eager to learn from the next generation of founders and support the creation of novel crypto markets. One emerging force we’re closely examining is AI weaving its way into crypto landscape. While we don’t view AI as a standalone use case, we do see it as a transformative layer that will enhance all verticals.

# 🚀 Investments and Themes for 2025

Colosseum launched in early 2024 to help developers compete and experiment across a wide spectrum of Solana-based products through online hackathons. 

Since then, the team has reviewed thousands of submissions, accepted multiple cohorts into its accelerator, and made pre-seed investments in more than 20 promising startups. 

Drawing on that hands-on experience, Colosseum has identified 12 high-growth verticals that are set to shape the Solana and broader crypto landscape in 2025, each one addressing real-world challenges.

A key theme running through all twelve verticals is a renewed focus on real-world utility and sophisticated market design. 

Whether it’s a sports fan token that unlocks new ways to engage with your favorite team, or a next-gen aggregator that forward-sells staked yield, these protocols aim to bring deep liquidity, better user experiences, and new revenue streams on-chain. 

And while Colosseum doesn’t see AI as its own siloed vertical, the team expects AI to become an indispensable layer across each of these categories by streamlining data insights, risk management, and user onboarding in ways we haven’t even imagined yet.

For developers and builders looking to stay ahead, these areas offer opportunities to create new markets and leverage existing ones. Expect these verticals to play an outsized role as we move into 2025 and beyond.

# ➰ Accounts Lattice Hash

Solana developers have introduced a proposal to tackle the [state growth problem](https://x.com/aeyakovenko/status/1789009684378382404?ref=blog.colosseum.org) by implementing a lattice-based system known as the Accounts Lattice Hash. 

According to the proposal ([SIMD-215](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0215-accounts-lattice-hash.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), ""the main goal is to scale Solana to billions of accounts and compute a ‘hash of all accounts’ in practical time and space.” 

One of the core changes involves homomorphic hashing, a method that verifies only the accounts that have changed, rather than reprocessing every account on the network. 

>Think of it like cleaning a house. Instead of scrubbing every single room every day, you only tidy up the spaces that got messy.  
\~ Republik Labs

At the end of each epoch, Solana’s Epoch Accounts Hash mechanism must rehash all accounts. As the size of Solana state grows, this process becomes increasingly resource-intensive.

In contrast, the lattice-based method accumulates individual account hashes directly and updates only the accounts that have changed. 

By eliminating the need for full recalculations, the approach will reduce computational overhead. This upgrade also aims to preserve the network’s existing security level, offering a path to global scale without sacrificing safety.

If the community approves this improvement, Solana’s infrastructure could set a new benchmark for blockchain scalability.

# 🛡️ Quantum Resistant Winternitz Vault

Google’s quantum computing project [Willow](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) made headlines recently and raised concerns in the crypto world. 

Blockchains use cryptographic systems built on mathematical problems that quantum computers could solve much faster, ultimately making it possible to reverse-engineer private keys from public keys.

While we're still a long way off from that ever happening, Solana developer Dean Little has introduced the Solana Winternitz Vault, an optional quantum-resistant vault that leverages hash-based signature technology.

The Solana Winternitz Vault is essentially a specialized account system that uses hash-based signatures instead of traditional elliptic curve cryptography. 

The idea is simple: Each time a user makes a transaction, a new private key is generated and revealed, minimizing the chance of a quantum computer exploiting previously exposed public keys. 

Under the hood, it leverages Winternitz One-Time Signatures (W-OTS) along with a Merkle root structure for added security and tamper-proof verification.

While the vault is an entirely optional feature, its hash-based signature approach shows an awareness of quantum threats and a commitment to protecting user funds as quantum computing continues to advance.

# 🗳️ Solana Founder Survey

Lightspeed polled 42 anonymous Solana founders on a variety of topics in the Solana space. 

Many founders remain bullish on Solana’s trajectory and culture, even saying if Solana didn’t exist, they wouldn’t be in crypto at all. 

However, among those open to other ecosystems, Base and Sui ranked as the most appealing. 

Founders also shared concerns about MEV on Solana, noting it drives up costs and makes transaction ordering more complex.

Memecoins got a “mostly good” label from respondents where AI agents were called “overrated” and seen by some as mostly hype. 

On the infrastructure side, founders said the demand for blockspace is growing fast, and they want bigger blocks to keep fees manageable.

Overall, founder sentiment highlights excitement about the future of Solana, a desire to fend off rising MEV concerns, and a readiness to innovate with new use cases.

>**3/** The Challenge: How do we onramp “the next billion users” to stablecoins if they live in countries where cash is still king?

https://preview.redd.it/iqgkjfrnu0ce1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa827818d26ff9774736ee751229742fc138015b

>**4/** 💡 The Solution: Leveraging existing “agent banking” networks

>• Mobile money agents form a hidden financial superhighway spanning all developing countries

>• Globally, 18M agents process $560B cash over the counter every year

>• These agents normally process cash for people’s bill payments, mobile topups, money transfers, remittances, etc



>**5/** 📈 Scaling our own agent network

>• DePIN incentive mechanisms allow us to programmatically scale token rewards by neighborhood, city and country

>• Early agents earn higher rewards, accelerating critical mass as we launch new markets

>• QR stands act as miniature billboards, sparking curiosity for digital dollars from all the foot traffic

>  
**6/** 📈 Massive untapped demand

>• DePIN platforms typically have trouble scaling demand side

>• However, emerging markets have massive unmet demand for dollars due to their scarcity through traditional channels.

>• People often pay 5-10% premiums to get their hands on dollars just to stuff them under their mattress or hide them in the closet.

>• ZAR democratizes access to the world’s strongest currency through easy access to stablecoins



>**7/** 🔍 How ZAR works: 

>1. Find nearby agent with the best fx rate

>2. Scan QR to trade 

>3. Hand over cash 

>4. Receive digital dollars instantly



>**8/** 🌐 Cash onramp infrastructure for all  

>• Our SDK enables any web3 app to integrate ZAR’s onramp/offramp 

>• Think of us like a MoonPay, but for cash onramping 

>• Building the Western Union/Moneygram of Web3

Reddit,solana,On how to build a wallet watcher,2025-01-09 02:43:42,"Every game in the world is won by knowing something the other players don’t. Crypto is no different. With the blockchain being public your job is to either be the winner with your own ideas or find the sharp plays made by the sharp accounts. Finding sharp accounts is still on you. But I’m here to share some insight into how to monitor these accounts with automation.

I’ve done a few YouTube videos sharing what I’ve learned about monitoring Solana transactions and I’ve done one about this topic. But with this subreddit’s understandable change to move away from links and self promotion I’ll be sharing this information in text format. 

This is just one way, but I think this is the fastest way to spin up a wallet watcher. The premise is that we can leverage a service provided by a company called Helius to monitor the transactions and alert an application we spin up with new updates from a wallet or account. Helius is one of the most reputable services to interact easily with Solana. Their free tier is generous and they offer a service that utilizes Webhooks, meaning that when Helius detects an account made a transaction, it will alert our application. Our application has to be hosted to receive webhooks. For my own use I am using Cloudflare Workers. It also has a generous free tier. But you can find hundreds of options for this part. 

I kept my tracker simple, when Cloudflare/the app receives the webhooks, it parses out the transaction and I have mine alert me via Telegram. 

That’s pretty much it. Helius to a quick Cloudflare Worker to Telegram. All you need to get started. I’ll try and update the post with the code later without a link for safety. But if you have any questions, my DMs are open. Best wishes ",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,solana,"Are meme coins quite literally only a giant pyramid scheme, please explain if not
",2025-01-08 16:11:37,"Edit: perhaps not a ‘pyramid scheme’ but rather MLM marketing 

I was initially thinking meme coins have value to them defined by the strength of the community and what we see today is a decentralization of marketing — if that makes sense.

For example, useless companies/brands are being sold for millions only due to the large audience it has accumulated. Now only a few at the top profit and everyone else gives all their money to them.

With meme coins (ideally speaking) everyone gets a stake of the profit sharing. No one cares about celebrities anymore — so whatever money they could have extracted from us we decided to just form our own community with it and we all have a chance of building together. Also, memes can be viewed as leverage to buy btc (which also implies the coin will have a short lifespan from an individual 'investor')

Of course, I’m leaving out the rug pulling as I’m talking of the what meme coins are supposed to be imo and not what inevitably happens to 99% of coins. But to answer the rug pulling, this is a byproduct of minimal regulations. As the sector grows and some regulation takes place, meme money will converge to the best memes that have proven its proof of concept.

Cool. But here’s where I’m at right now:

1. Memes have almost no intrinsic value
2. People buy a meme for its growth
3. Memes are not a store of value
4. Memes run on another crypto’s blockchain

These equate to the same very thick ceiling for all memes. Once a meme hits a certain MC, it’s basically a wrap for the meme. People don’t see it having quick growth anymore, it’s not a store of value, what if it grew so much you need to spend 1 SOL just to get a fraction of a meme, hey it’s dipping and there actually is not intrinsic value to any of this —> dump

So far, going long on any memecoin after initial hype almost always results in failure. Long as in 5yrs+. Doge is doing ight (although I’m sure most got burned) but only because of Elon.

So, given the above how can meme coins not be a giant pyramid scheme? I’m not even talking about rug pulling here. After an its growth, you have to cash out because memes don’t store value. They only Caveat I see is no one knows when it stops growing — but at the moment mc is a huge indicator.

My only optimistic conclusion so far is Solana just has to explode to increase the ceiling of these coins, and there needs to be a huge barrier for minting new memes thus other coins will have long term value. And I think memes are going to be around because gambling hasn’t gone anywhere.

My question is though, is a ‘strong community’ actually enough to support a meme coin, long term? People want to buy a meme, forget about it, come back 5yrs later and still be up.

* UK-based fintech firm Revolut became the first banking data publisher to join the multi-chain Pyth Network.
* Revolut will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth price feeds, allowing DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

Crypto-friendly fintech firm Revolut has become the first banking data publisher to join the Pyth Network.

 — a provider of real-time market data for onchain applications.

Revolut, which boasts over 45 million users across 200 countries, will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth’s price feeds, enabling DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

“Our partnership with Pyth is an important milestone in Revolut's journey to modernize finance,” Revolut Global Business Head of Crypto Mazen Eljundi said. “By working with Pyth to provide our reliable market data to applications, Revolut can influence digital economies by ensuring developers and users have access to the precise, real-time information they need.”

As a Pyth oracle network publisher, the digital banking platform will help secure the operations of hundreds of dapps, which can now access over 500 real-time feeds for digital and traditional assets, responsible for more than $1 trillion in total traded volume during 2024, according to a statement shared with The Block.

Other Pyth data publishers include Amber Group, Binance, Bitstamp, Bybit, Cboe, Cumberland DRW, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, Jane Street, OKX, Raydium and Wintermute.

“Pyth’s collaboration with Revolut is part of a larger trend we’re seeing, where traditional banking institutions, trusted by millions of customers globally, are recognizing the value of decentralized finance and digital assets,” Michael Cahill, CEO and co-founder of Douro Labs, core contributor to the Pyth Network, said. “Together, we are driving the future of finance, where transparent and reliable data empowers the next generation of financial applications.”

Originally designed for the Solana blockchain, Pyth Network now operates across more than 80 blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Aptos and Sui, providing real-time market data for cryptocurrencies, equities, FX and commodities.

# Revolut’s expanding crypto initiatives

In May 2024, the fintech firm launched a standalone crypto trading platform, Revolut X, in the UK, subsequently [expanding](https://www.theblock.co/post/326175/revolut-expands-crypto-exchange-30-markets) to 30 European countries in November. In September, Revolut was also [reported to be](https://www.theblock.co/post/317166/uk-fintech-firm-revolut-intends-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin-report) in the process of launching its own stablecoin.

Revolut [secured](https://www.theblock.co/post/307389/crypto-friendly-fintech-revolut-secures-banking-license-from-uk-financial-regulator) a banking license from the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority in July 2024, after a three-year application process. Obtaining a UK banking license is notoriously difficult due to the stringent regulatory and compliance requirements imposed by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority.

For several decades, the UK banking sector was dominated by large, established institutions, and no new banking licenses were granted until Metro Bank in 2010. The Bank of Dave campaign following the 2008 financial crisis highlighted the challenges of entering the sector, and subsequent reforms helped pave the way for several other new banks, including Monzo and Starling, which disrupted the market.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,solana,Had to use all my Solana funds to pay a vet bill,2025-01-07 22:26:53,"My Dog (16 months) has been biting at his backside and back legs for the last almost two weeks. For a while it just looked like he was chasing his tail so I didn't think much of it but over time he was doing it more and more and then he would start chewing on his back legs while whining so I ended up to him to the vet and it turns out he had parasites (most likely from eating something off the ground outside)

The bill ended up being almost $300 and my work always slows down to a crawl in the beginning months of the year so I had to use whatever I had in my solana chain which was around $200 to help cover the cost. I'm happy I was able to get my dog the help he needed but I'm also devastated that my crypto is gone.

This is my first time getting into crypto and this setback just makes me think that this isn't for me. Has anyone else struggled from not using their crypto so it can actually grow? And if so how did you come back from losing it all?",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,solana,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-07 13:22:55,"Hey fam, happy new year. This was popular on r/Solidity, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT:*** *The deadline to apply was just extended from to January 11th!*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

LMK if you have any questions, the team or I can try to give more info.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,solana,Re: looking for assistance coding flash loan arbitrage bot,2025-01-08 06:50:51,"Posted last week and got scammed. Looking for a couple of people to join a team to test and develop a flash loan arbitrage bot for sol and SPL tokens on raydium orca serum and jupyter. I understand arbitrage but need some assistance with the more technical aspects of coding the bot. Looking forward to learning a lot on my own and contributing what I can to the project. All code will be shared in a private github repo so that the developers can use it on their own machines or servers once it is working and tested. No telegram. I will host a discord server or something else that cannot be taken down. Everyone can fork the repo as long as it remains private and all forks are private when we are finished. No one will be asked to contribute money at any time. Everyone will work on either planning, logic, coding, or optimization. Your payment is the finished project which only the small dev team will have access to. My knowledge is limited so don't be intimidated, just ready to learn and contribute what you can. There are no time constraints. It will be done when it is as profitable as we can practically make it. Again, no money or crypto will be exchanged between any members of the dev team. Wsl, debian based hyperv or other vm, or bare metal Linux will be required. Knowledge on Linux is not required as it is easy to learn for what we are trying to do. No scammers allowed. Got burned and not letting it happen again. Leave helpful comments with suggestions for finding a team or if you are interested in joining the team. Let's try to make some passive income and learn a little along the way. ",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,solana,Can’t find grass tokens after swapping with usdc on raydium,2025-01-08 07:56:47,"I swapped Usdc for grass tokens on raydium but I am unable to find where my grass tokens are. I put my trust wallet's solana address expecting it to show up there but I cannot find it. It says the transaction is a success, however there are a couple indicators that I am unsure about the reliability of this transaction.

I connected the same wallet to radium on my laptop and the transaction was not on my history but only on my phone. I have linked a photo below of what it looks like.

The USDC from my account is gone but the grass tokens are nowhere to be found.

Does anyone know what happened? Thanks

Reddit,solana,Solana's SIMD-215 Proposal: A Major Step Toward Blockchain Scalability and Quantum Resistance,2025-01-07 16:19:23,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my thoughts on an exciting development I came across in the blockchain space: Solana's SIMD-215 proposal. This update aims to solve some of the most significant challenges in blockchain scalability.

At its core, SIMD-215 introduces Solana's Accounts Lattice Hash system, which addresses inefficient account state updates. By using homomorphic hashing, the network only updates what’s changed, instead of recalculating the entire state from scratch. This approach allows for:

Improved efficiency 👍

The ability to support billions of accounts 😳

Enhanced security, with 128-bit encryption and quantum resistance

What stands out to me is not only how Solana is solving current scalability issues, but also how it's preparing for future threats, like quantum computing. This could be a game-changer in making blockchain networks more secure and scalable for widespread adoption.

What do you all think about this approach? Do you believe scalability is the key to blockchain reaching mainstream adoption, or are there other factors at play?

Reddit,solana,Rust (Now Go) Trading Platform from Scratch - Update 3,2025-01-07 19:12:57,"The second update:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust\_trading\_platform\_from\_scratch\_update\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1h6ljbv/rust_trading_platform_from_scratch_update_2/)

Moving these posts over to here instead of r/algotrading  because I think there are some folks here who could benefit from it.

I've been building an algotrading and fraud detection/chain analysis system in Rust for the last several months. Despite loving Rust, I immediately started running into some significant issues with the language and this application.

**the issues**

Rust is very good. It's very fast, incredibly memory efficient, and has lots of libraries required to build onchain. Solana is built on it, obviously.

The issue that Rust has is working with unstructured data, or data whose structure is pretty difficult to define. I wanted to build out a custom parser for transactions, and the going was incredibly slow and painful. Between parsing bytes and converting them to different data types to dealing with weird memory footguns, it became so annoying to write that I genuinely left the project alone for a week or two.

Everyone on r/algotrading was recommending Golang. I'd written some serverless lambda applications in Golang, and really liked it. It's like taking the ease of use of Python and adding the speed and power of Rust or C. Yes, it's garbage collected and therefore probably a wee bit slower than Rust, but the difference was basically ""not finish a very fast solution in Rust"" or ""finish a fairly fast solution in Golang"" and I've seen how dumb a lot of ya'll are, I'm not going to need breakneck speed to win in this market and do a lot of the analytical work I'm trying to do. I also have a vision of a system where Golang does all the data fetching and structuring and Rust does all of the data analytics, but that's long down the road.

**golang rules**

I started the Golang conversion yesterday, and I'm already close to achieving relative parity with my Rust codebase. I also get to use Raylib for data visualization, which seems to be much more mature than Bevy, the game engine I was using in Rust.

**lesson: dev speed isn't just about how quickly you can get something out there**

The dev speed in Rust was so bad that I literally found myself not wanting to work on the project. I spent ages just figuring out how to make the memory management work instead of adding features. I still believe Rust is a fantastic language, but I don't think I'm going to go back to it for projects that require a lot of unstructured data parsing. I just develop better software, faster, using Go right now.

**the overall plan**

I'm going to get the basics of wallet visualization and management working first and then work on the trading engine. I've got a shared RPC node with a ton of available bandwidth, so I've got a lot of leeway to test and gather data with.

After that, I'm going to build out the data vis layer at the same time as the trading engine. I think it'll be helpful to be able to visualize other wallets and their strategies while I develop my own, and I have a few wallets I want to look into.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,solana,Educational Blog Post - Solana Token Accounts (ATA) Made Simple: Why They’re Needed and How They Work ?,2025-01-06 23:40:26,"**Source:** [https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-theyre-needed-and-how-they-work-d19656299af2](https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-theyre-needed-and-how-they-work-d19656299af2)

Ever wondered how tokens work on the Solana blockchain? What does a “create token account” transaction mean?

https://preview.redd.it/nj77i7j1mgbe1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5c450c74be676992742c1c1438a82288d852ec

Unlike some other blockchains, Solana uses a special system called “associated token accounts” to handle tokens efficiently and securely. Let’s break it down in a way that’s easy to understand, with examples you can relate to!

# What Is an Associated Token Account (ATA)?

Imagine you’ve got a locker at school. Each locker is labeled with your name and can only store one type of item — say books, snacks, or gym clothes. On Solana, an associated token account is like your personal locker for a specific token. It’s tied to your wallet (your unique ID) and can only hold one kind of token, like USDC or Bonk or Pengu.

This setup keeps everything organized and easy to find. It also ensures that tokens are stored safely in the right place.

# Why Do You Need an ATA?

Here’s the deal: before you can use a token — whether to buy something, trade, or receive an airdrop — you need a specific locker (an ATA) for that token. Without it, you’d have nowhere to store the token! Let’s look at some reasons why this is important:

1. **Organization:** Everyone’s tokens are stored in their own lockers, so it’s clear who owns what.
2. **Compatibility:** Apps and games on Solana know where to look for your tokens because ATAs follow a standard design.
3. **Simplicity:** You don’t need to manually manage different accounts. The system does it for you!

# How Do You Create an ATA?

Typically, ATAs are created automatically as a part of a buy or transfer transaction. All wallets, trading platforms, and bots handle this for you.

However, sometimes users might want to create an ATA in a separate transaction:

1. This can make your buy or transfer transaction “smaller,” which increases the chances of it being processed faster — especially during times of high network traffic.
2. On the flip side, some spammers take advantage of this system by creating lots of unnecessary ATA transactions trying to trick other people into buying their tokens.

Associated token accounts might sound complicated at first, but they’re really just a clever way to keep track of tokens on Solana. Think of them as your personal lockers — safe, organized, and ready for anything. Whether you’re playing games, trading, or just holding tokens, ATAs make it all work smoothly.

So next time you hear about “create associated token account” transactions, you’ll know it’s just Solana setting up a locker for your tokens. Easy, right? Now go out there and explore the world of Solana!",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

# Introduction

*“We knew smaller, faster, cheaper better than anybody else in the world, and now we're applying those concepts to blockchain.” — Greg Fitzgerald, Solana co-founder*

Solana is a high-performance, low-latency blockchain renowned for its speed, efficiency, and focus on user experience. Its unique integrated architecture enables thousands of transactions per second across a globally decentralized network. With a block time of 400 milliseconds and transaction fees that are fractions of a cent, it delivers on both speed and cost-effectiveness. This report delves into the intricacies of Solana's design and operation, exploring the key mechanisms and network topology that contribute to its capabilities.

Solana takes an integrated approach to blockchain development, leveraging the founding team's decades of experience in building distributed systems. One of Solana's core principles is that software should never get in the way of hardware. This means that software exploits whatever hardware it runs on to the fullest and scales with it. As a unified ecosystem, all applications built on top of this single blockchain inherit composability, enabling them to interact and build upon each other seamlessly. This architecture also ensures a straightforward and intuitive user experience without the need for bridging, separate chain IDs, or liquidity fragmentation.

Solana is evolving rapidly, with recent developments including SVM rollups and [ZK Compression](https://www.zkcompression.com/) as important scaling solutions. While these projects may one day shape our future perception of Solana, they are currently in the very early stages of development or adoption and will not be covered in this report.

# Transaction Lifecycle

Our primary lens for understanding Solana throughout this report will be the lifecycle of a typical transaction. To construct a basic model for understanding Solana transactions, we can outline the process as follows: 

https://preview.redd.it/y27ncoggogbe1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f24f7d74ee34e53e7e15ad616c291587de0885b

* Users initiate transactions, all of which are sent to the current lead block producer (known as the leader). The leader compiles these transactions into a block, executing them and thereby updating their local state.
* This block of transactions is then propagated throughout the network for other validators to execute and confirm.

The subsequent sections of this report will expand this model and delve into this process in much greater detail, beginning with the key participants—the users.

# Remember

*Substantial changes to the core Solana protocol go through a formal, transparent* [*process*](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md) *of submitting a Solana Improvement Document (SIMD) which community members and core engineering will publicly critique. SIMDs are then voted on by the network.*

# Six stages

https://preview.redd.it/bb6i7wxjogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d445455affd3993d91da00bf732ea4c01128a7

We will reference the six-stage visual shown above throughout this report, as it offers us a consistent framework for understanding the relationships between Solana's core elements.

Earlier chapters are arranged according to these six stages. The final chapters—Gossip, Archive, Economics, and Jito—tie up any loose ends. It’s important to note that some chapters will span multiple stages, and some stages will appear in multiple chapters.

This overlap is unavoidable because the six-stage framework has its limitations. In reality, Solana is a complex distributed system with many interdependent elements.

# Users

*“Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto” — Raj Gokal, Solana co-founder*

A user's journey typically begins by setting up and funding a wallet application. Multiple popular wallet applications are available for Solana, either as native mobile applications or browser extensions.

Wallets cryptographically generate user keypairs, consisting of public and private keys. The public key acts as the unique identifier for their account and is known by all participants in the network. A user’s account on Solana can be considered a data structure that holds information and state related to their interactions with the Solana blockchain. In this way, a public key is similar to a filename: just as a filename uniquely identifies a file within a file system, a Solana public key uniquely identifies an account on the Solana blockchain. Public keys on Solana are represented as 32-byte Base58-encoded strings.

`FDKJvWcJNe6wecbgDYDFPCfgs14aJnVsUfWQRYWLn4Tn`

A private key — also known as a secret key —can be considered as the password or access key that grants permission to access and modify the account. Signing with private keys is how blockchains handle authorization. Knowledge of the private key gives absolute authority over the account. Solana private keys are also 32-bytes in length. Keypairs are the 64-byte combinations of public (first half) and private (second half) keys. Examples:

`3j15jr41S9KmdfughusutvvqBjAeEDbU5sDQp8EbwQ3Hify2pfM1hiEsuFFAVq8bwGywnZpswrbDzPENbBZbd5nj`

`[63,107,47,255,141,135,58,142,191,245,78,18,90,162,107,197,8,33,211,15,228,235,250,30,185,122,105,23,147,115,115,86,8,155,67,155,110,51,117,0,19,150,143,217,132,205,122,91,167,61,6,246,107,39,51,110,185,81,13,81,16,182,30,71]`

Private keys can also be derived from mnemonic seed phrases, usually 12 or 24 words long. This format is often used in wallets for easier backup and recovery. Multiple keys can be derived deterministically from a single seed phrase.

Solana utilizes [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519), a widely used elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, for its public-key cryptography needs. Ed25519 is favored for its small key size, small signature size, fast computation, and immunity to many common attacks. Each Solana wallet address represents a point on the Ed25519 elliptic curve.

https://preview.redd.it/astjuuasogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7094772d293060d90b5e9e70e2d4c65a13fe3a

The user signs transactions with their private key. This signature is included with the transaction data and can be verified by other participants using the sender's public key. This process ensures the transaction has not been tampered with and is authorized by the owner of the corresponding private key. The signature also acts as a unique identifier for the transaction.

# Solana Transactions

Sending a transaction is the only way to mutate state on Solana. Any write operation is performed through a transaction, and transactions are atomic—either everything the transaction attempts to do happens or the transaction fails. A transaction, more formally known as a ""transaction message,"" comprises four sections: a header, a list of account addresses, a recent blockhash, and instructions.

https://preview.redd.it/yl7lvpouogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5349733808055e00bf0a209ed2174abd529619d7

* Header: The header contains references to the account address list, indicating which accounts must sign the transaction.
* Account Addresses: This list includes all the accounts that will be read from or written to during the transaction. Building such a list for every transaction is a requirement unique to Solana and can be challenging for developers. However, knowing in advance which pieces of state a transaction will interact with enables optimizations not possible on many other blockchains.
* Recent Blockhash: This is used to prevent duplicate and stale transactions. A recent blockhash expires after 150 blocks (about 1 minute). By default, RPCs attempt to forward transactions every 2 seconds until the transaction is either finalized or the recent blockhash expires, at which point the transaction is dropped.
* Instructions: These form the core part of the transaction. Each instruction represents a specific operation (e.g., transfer, mint, burn, create account, close account). Each instruction specifies the program to execute, the accounts required, and the data needed for the instruction's execution.

The number of instructions in a transaction is limited first by its size, which can be up to 1,232 bytes. There are also limits around the number of accounts that can be referenced. Lastly, there are limits to a transaction’s complexity measured in compute units (CUs). CUs quantify the computational resources expended in processing transactions.

# Remember

*The smallest unit of SOL is known as a ""lamport,"" equivalent to one billionth of a SOL, similar to a satoshi in Bitcoin. The lamport is named after* [*Leslie Lamport*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)*, a computer scientist and mathematician whose research established many theoretical foundations of modern distributed systems.*

The cost in SOL to execute a transaction is separated into 2 parts - a base fee and a prioritization fee. The base fee is a fixed 5000 lamports per signature cost irrespective of the transaction’s complexity—usually, there is 1 signature per transaction.

Prioritization fees are technically optional, but during periods of high demand for blockspace become necessary. These fees are priced in micro-lamports (millionth of a lamport) per compute unit. Their purpose is to act as a price signal, making transactions more economically compelling for validator nodes to include in their blocks. 

`total fee = prioritization fee + base fee`

`prioritization fee = compute unit price (micro-lamports) x compute unit limit`

Currently, 50% of all transaction-related fees are burnt, permanently removing this SOL from circulation with the remaining 50% going to the block producer. A new change (SIMD 96) is soon to be introduced allowing for 100% of prioritization fees to go to the block producer. Base fees remain unchanged.

# Sending transactions

https://preview.redd.it/ciea7ftyogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0407e01298915f6b4310da6b5271465500f8be7d

A user connects their wallet to the application, allowing the app to read the user’s public key. The private key remains encrypted and securely sandboxed in a separate environment from the application.

The application builds the transaction message parameters based on the user’s interactions. For example, if a user wanted to swap two tokens, they would specify the amount of tokens to buy, the corresponding tokens to sell, and an acceptable transaction slippage.

‍Once the transaction message is ready, it is sent to the wallet to be signed with the user’s private key. At this point, the user is prompted with a popup to confirm their willingness to transact. This popup may include a simulation of the transaction’s results. Once signed, the transaction message and the signature are returned to the app, which can then forward the transaction to an RPC provider of their choice, either their own or by using the wallet’s provider.

‍RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers act as intermediaries between applications and the validators that build blocks. They are an essential service that enables applications to [submit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/cd6f931223181d5a1d47cba64e857785a175a760/rpc/src/rpc.rs#L3396) or simulate signed transactions and efficiently retrieve on-chain data. Applications that wish to interact with the network do so via a JSON-RPC or a WebSocket endpoint ([docs](https://solana.com/docs/rpc)).

# Remember

*The term “failed transaction” on Solana is misleading and has caused considerable confusion. These transactions incur fees and are executed successfully by the runtime exactly as the signer intended. They “fail” due to the transaction’s own logic requiring them to do so. +80% of “failed” transactions come from error code 0x1771, the code for exceeding slippage amount (*[*data*](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/zapokorny/q/18zuYlugBdcm/solana-failed-txs-by-program)*). Notably, 95% of these transactions are submitted by only 0.1% of active Solana addresses, primarily automated bots attempting to take advantage of time-sensitive price arbitrage opportunities.*

# Gulf Stream

*“Literally the goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world — so speed of light through fiber. Who we’re competing with is NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) refer to RPC nodes. These nodes can be thought of as gateways to interact with and read data from the network. They run the same software as full validators but with different settings, allowing them to accurately simulate transactions and maintain an up-to-date view of the current state. As of this writing, there are over 4,000 RPC nodes on the Solana network.

‍Unlike full validator nodes, RPC nodes do not hold any stake in the network. Without stake, they cannot vote or build blocks. This setup differs from most other blockchains, where the validator and RPC nodes are typically the same. Since RPC nodes do not receive staking rewards, the economics of running RPC nodes are distinct from those of validators with many operating as a paid service for developers running Solana applications.

‍Solana stands out because it was designed from the outset to operate without a mempool. Unlike traditional blockchains that use gossip protocols to randomly and broadly propagate transactions across the network, Solana forwards all transactions to a predetermined lead validator, known as the leader, for each slot.

https://preview.redd.it/efimg7g5pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ddc929f7c96b3eb528f3d8768388853e1c62db

# Callout

*Solana operates four clusters: Localnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet-Beta. When people refer to Solana or the Solana network, they almost always refer to Mainnet-Beta. Mainnet-Beta is the only cluster where tokens hold real value, while the other clusters are used solely for testing purposes.*

‍Once an RPC receives a transaction message to be included in a block, it must be forwarded to the leader. A leader schedule is produced before every epoch (approximately every two days). The upcoming epoch is divided into slots, each fixed at 400 milliseconds, and a leader is chosen for each slot. Validators with a higher stake will be chosen more often to become leader within each epoch. During each slot, transaction messages are forwarded to the leader, who has the opportunity to produce a block. When it is a validator’s turn, they switch to ""leader mode,"" begin actively processing transactions and broadcasting blocks to the rest of the network.

# ‍Stake-Weighted Quality of Service - SWQoS

‍In early 2024, Solana introduced a new mechanism aimed at preventing spam and enhancing Sybil resistance, known as ""Stake-Weighted Quality of Service"" (SWQoS). This system enables leaders to prioritize transaction messages that are proxied through other staked validators. Here, validators with a higher stake are granted a proportionally higher capacity to transmit transaction message packets to the leader. This approach effectively mitigates Sybil attacks from non-staked nodes across the network.

https://preview.redd.it/gacy1qn8pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e510254be8f3dfe4465bb02297771ec19e98024

Under this model, validators can also engage in agreements to lease their stake-weighted capacity to RPC nodes. In return, RPC nodes gain increased bandwidth, allowing them to achieve greater transaction inclusion rates in blocks. Notably, 80% of a leader’s capacity (2,000 connections) is reserved for SWQoS. The remaining 20% (500 connections) is allocated for transaction messages from non-staked nodes. This allocation strategy mirrors priority lanes on highways, where drivers pay a toll to avoid traffic.

‍SWQoS has impacted the Solana ecosystem by raising the requirements to forward transactions to the leader and reducing the effectiveness of spam attacks. The change has incentivized high-traffic applications to vertically integrate their operations. By running their own validator nodes, or by having access to staked connections, applications can ensure privileged access to the leader, thereby enhancing their transaction processing capabilities.

# ‍A QUIC Note

‍In late 2022, Solana adopted the [QUIC networking protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to manage transaction message transmission to the leader. This transition was prompted by network disruptions caused by bots spamming on-chain NFT mints. QUIC facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication.

https://preview.redd.it/hqfeng0bpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a7002fb6203d3e7535299c6a4340f55cc8927d

Initially developed by [Google](https://research.google/pubs/the-quic-transport-protocol-design-and-internet-scale-deployment/) in 2012, QUIC attempts to offer the best of both worlds. It facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication similar to UDP, but with the secure sessions and advanced flow control strategies of TCP. This allows for limits to be placed on individual sources of traffic so that the network can focus on processing genuine transactions. It also has a concept of separate streams; so if one transaction is dropped, it doesn’t need to block the remaining ones. In short, QUIC can be thought of as attempting to combine the best characteristics of TCP and UDP.

# ‍Callout box

*Stake-weighting is a recurring principle found throughout Solana's systems, encompassing voting rewards, turbine trees, leader schedules, Gulf Stream, and the gossip network. Validators with greater stake are accorded higher trust and prioritized roles in the network.*

# ‍Block Building

*“We consider SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) the best in terms of virtual machine technology currently.” — Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation*

Many blockchain networks construct entire blocks before broadcasting them, known as discrete block building. Solana, in contrast, employs continuous block building which involves assembling and streaming blocks dynamically as they are created during an allocated time slot, significantly reducing latency.

‍Each slot lasts 400 milliseconds, and each leader is assigned four consecutive slots (1.6 seconds) before rotation to the next leader. For a block to gain acceptance, all transactions within it must be valid and reproducible by other nodes.

‍Two slots before assuming leadership, a validator halts transaction forwarding to prepare for its upcoming workload. During this interval, inbound traffic spikes, reaching over a gigabyte per second as the entire network directs packets to the incoming leader.

‍Upon receipt, transaction messages enter the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), the validator's core logic responsible for block production. Here, the transaction processing sequence begins with the Fetch Stage, where transactions are received via QUIC. Subsequently, transactions progress to the SigVerify Stage, undergoing rigorous validation checks. Here the validator verifies the validity of signatures, checks for the correct number of signatures, and eliminates duplicate transactions.

https://preview.redd.it/tfq1r9pfpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07e829c1264f29fab5b9e1752ad2ec1048b3593

# Banking Stage

The banking stage can be described as the block-building stage. It is the most important stage of the TPU, which gets its name from the “bank“. A bank is just the state at a given block. For every block, Solana has a bank that is used to access state at that block. When a block becomes finalized after enough validators vote on it, they will flush account updates from the bank to disk, making them permanent. The final state of the chain is the result of all confirmed transactions. This state can always be recreated from the blockchain history deterministically.

‍Transactions are processed in parallel and packaged into ledger “entries,” which are batches of 64 non-conflicting transactions. Parallel transaction processing on Solana is made easy because each transaction must include a complete list of all the accounts it will read and write to. This design choice places a burden on developers but allows the validator to avoid race conditions by easily selecting only non-conflicting transactions for execution within each entry. Transactions conflict if they both attempt to write to the same account (two writes) or if one attempts to read from and the other writes to the same account (read + write). Thus conflicting transactions go into different entries and are executed sequentially, while non-conflicting transactions are executed in parallel.

‍There are six threads processing transactions in parallel, with four dedicated to normal transactions and two exclusively handling vote transactions which are integral to Solana’s consensus mechanism. All parallelization of processing is achieved through multiple CPU cores; validators have no GPU requirements ([docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements)).

‍Once transactions have been grouped into entries, they are ready to be executed by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The accounts necessary for the transaction are locked; checks are run to confirm the transaction is recent but hasn’t already been processed. The accounts are loaded, and the transaction logic is executed, updating the account states. A hash of the entry will be sent to the Proof of History service to be recorded (more on this in the next section). If the recording process is successful, all changes will be committed to the bank, and the locks on each account placed in the first step are lifted. Execution is done by the SVM, a virtual machine built using the Solana fork of [rBPF](https://docs.rs/solana_rbpf/latest/solana_rbpf/), a library for working with JIT compilation, and virtual machines for eBPF programs. Note Solana does not mandate how validators choose to order transactions within a block. This flexibility is a crucial point that we will return to later in the Economics + Jito section of this report.

# ‍Remember

*The term SVM can be ambiguous, as it may refer to either the ""Solana Virtual Machine"" or the ""Sealevel Virtual Machine."" Both terms describe the same concept, with Sealevel being the name of Solana's runtime environment. The term SVM continues to be loosely thrown around despite recent efforts to precisely* [*define its boundaries*](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/anzas-new-svm-api)*.*

# ‍Clients

‍Solana is a network comprising thousands of independently operated nodes collaborating to maintain a single unified ledger. Each node constitutes a high-performance machine running the same open-source software known as a “client”.

‍Solana launched with a single validator client software — originally the Solana Labs client, now known as the [Agave client ](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave)— written in Rust. Expanding client diversity has been a priority ever since and one that will truly come to fruition with the launch of the [Firedancer client](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer). Firedancer is a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language. Built by an experienced team from high-frequency trading firm Jump, it promises to be the most performant validator client on any blockchain.

# Proof of History

*“I had two coffees and a beer, and I was up until 4:00 AM. I had this eureka moment that puzzle \[sic\] similar to proof of work using the same SHA-256 preimage-resistant hash function… I knew that I had this arrow of time.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Proof of History (PoH) is Solana's secret sauce, functioning like a special clock in every validator that facilitates synchronization across the network. PoH establishes a reliable source of truth for the order of events and the passage of time. Most critically it ensures adherence to the leader schedule. Despite similar names, Proof of History is not a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work.

https://preview.redd.it/5m9vzdnppgbe1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b68f99530f62595829ba76bdf159cb127f2940

Communication overhead between nodes typically increases as networks expand, and coordination becomes increasingly complicated. Solana mitigates this by replacing node-to-node communication with a PoH local computation. This means validators can commit to a block with just a single round of voting. Trusted timestamps in messages ensure that validators cannot step over each other and start their blocks prematurely.

Underlying PoH are the unique properties of hashing algorithms, specifically [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2):

* **Deterministic:** The same input will always produce the same hash.
* **Fixed Size:** Regardless of input size, the output hash is always 256 bits.
* **Efficient:** It is fast to compute the hash for any given input.
* [**Preimage Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack)**:** Finding the original input from the hash output is computationally infeasible.
* **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input (even a single bit) results in a significantly different hash, a property known as the avalanche effect.
* [**Collision Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance)**:** It is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

Within each validator client, a dedicated ""Proof of History service"" continually runs the SHA256 hash algorithm creating a chain of hashes. Each hash’s input is the previous hash's output. This chain acts the same as a verifiable delay function, given that the hashing work must be done in sequence and the results of future hashes cannot be known ahead of time. If the PoH service creates a chain of a thousand hashes, we know time has passed for it to have calculated each hash sequentially — this can be thought of as a “micro proof of work.” Yet, other validators can verify the correctness of the thousand hashes in parallel at a much faster rate than they were produced since the input and output of each hash have been broadcast to the network. Therefore, PoH is difficult to produce but easy to verify.

The range of performance in computing SHA-256 across different CPUs is surprisingly narrow, with only small differences among the fastest machines. A common upper limit has already been reached, despite significant time and effort being invested in optimizing this function, largely due to Bitcoin's reliance on it.

During a leader’s slot, the PoH service will receive newly processed entries from the banking stage. The current PoH hash plus a hash of all transactions in the entry are combined into the next PoH hash. This serves as a timestamp that inserts the entry into the chain of hashes, proving the sequence in which transactions were processed. This process not only confirms the passage of time but also serves as a cryptographic record of the transactions.

In a single block, there are 800,000 hashes. The PoH stream also includes ""ticks,"" which are empty entries indicating the leader's liveness and the passage of time approximating a small fraction of a second. A tick occurs every 6.25 milliseconds, resulting in 64 ticks per block and a total block time of 400 milliseconds.

Validators continually run the PoH clock even when they are not the leader as it plays a pivotal role in the process of synchronization between nodes.

# Remember

*The key benefit of PoH is that it ensures the correct leader schedule must be adhered to, even if a block producer is offline — a state known as being “delinquent”. PoH prevents a malicious validator from producing blocks before their turn.*

# Accounts Model

*“Separating code and state in SVM was the best design decision. Blessed are the embedded system devs that religiously drilled this concept into my brain.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Within a Solana validator, the global state is maintained in the accounts database known as AccountsDB. This database is responsible for storing all accounts, both in memory and on disk. The primary data structure in the account index is a hashmap, making AccountsDB essentially a vast [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database). Here, the key is the account address, and the value is the account data.

‍Over time the number of Solana accounts has surged into the hundreds of millions. This large number is partly because, as Solana developers are fond of saying, ""Everything on Solana is an account!""

https://preview.redd.it/od9jdizvpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad934df81448f583fc49d29e7306cef5a4dc505

# Solana accounts

‍An account is a container that persistently holds data, similar to a file on a computer. They come in various forms:

‍User accounts: These accounts have a private key and are typically generated by a wallet software for a user.

* Data accounts: These accounts store state information, such as the number of a specific token a user holds.
* Program accounts: These are larger accounts that contain executable bytecode, somewhat equivalent to a .exe file on Windows or a .app file on Mac.
* Native program accounts: These are special pre-deployed program accounts that perform various core functionalities of the network. [Examples](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/programs) include the Vote Program and the BPF Loader.

‍All accounts have the following fields:

https://preview.redd.it/ek1vnit0qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c085da69525391de492cb3eb50db8d3fea40a330

# Programs

Solana program accounts contain only executable logic. This means when a program is run it mutates the state of other accounts but remains unchanged itself. This separation of code and state differentiates Solana from other blockchains and supports many of its optimizations. Developers primarily write these programs in Rust, a general-purpose programming language [known](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf) for its strong focus on safety and performance. Additionally, multiple SDKs in [TypeScript](https://www.helius.dev/blog/build-solana-programs-with-typescript-poseidon) and Python are available to facilitate the creation of application front-ends and enable programmatic interaction with the network.

‍Many common functionalities are provided out-of-the-box by native programs. For example, Solana does not require developers to deploy code to create a token. Instead, instructions are sent to a pre-deployed native program that will set up an account to store the token’s metadata, effectively creating a new token.

# ‍Rent

‍Rent is a mechanism designed to incentivize users to close accounts and reduce state bloat. To create a new account, a minimum balance of SOL, known as the ""rent-exempt"" amount, must be held by the account. This can be considered a storage cost incurred to keep the account alive in a validator's memory. If the size of the account's data increases, the minimum balance rent requirement increases proportionally. When an account is no longer needed, it can be closed, and the rent is returned to the account owner. 

‍For example, if a user holds a dollar-denominated stablecoin, this state is stored in a token account. Currently, the rent-exempt amount for a token account is 0.002 SOL. If the user transfers their entire stablecoin balance to a friend, the token account can be closed, and the user will receive back their 0.002 SOL. Programs often handle account closures automatically for users. Several applications are available to help users clean up old, unused accounts and reclaim the small amounts of SOL stored in them.

# ‍Ownership

‍While reading account data is universally permitted, Solana's ownership model enhances security by restricting exactly who can modify (write) an account's data. This concept is crucial for enforcing rules and permissions on the Solana blockchain. Every account has a program ""owner"". The owner of an account is responsible for governing it, ensuring that only authorized programs can change the account's data. A notable exception to this rule is the transfer of lamports (the smallest unit of SOL)—increasing an account's lamports balance is universally permitted, regardless of ownership.

# ‍Storage of State

‍Solana programs, being read-only executable files, must store state using “Program Derived Addresses” (PDAs). PDAs are special types of accounts associated with and owned by a program rather than a specific user. While normal Solana user addresses are derived from the public key of an Ed25519 key pair, PDAs do not have a private key. Instead, their public key is derived from a combination of parameters—often keywords or other account addresses—along with the program ID (address) of the owning program.

‍PDA addresses exist ""off-curve,"" meaning they are not on the Ed25519 curve like normal addresses. Only the program that owns the PDA can programmatically generate signatures for it, ensuring that it’s the only one that can modify the PDA's state.

https://preview.redd.it/82dag167qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5e5694b996bf17c3928282a7cf37dfb104b75e

Above: Solana token accounts are specific examples of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). They are used to hold tokens and live “off-curve.” The Associated Token Account (ATA) program ensures that each wallet can only have one associated token account for each token type, providing a standardized way to manage token accounts.

# ‍Turbine

*“The most interesting part about Solana is not parallelization, the SVM, or Toly's tweets. It is something you probably haven't heard of: Turbine.” — Mert Mumtaz, Helius*

During the banking stage, transactions are organized into entries and sent to the Proof of History stream for timestamping. The block's bank is updated, and the entries are now ready for the next phase—Turbine.

Turbine is the process through which the leader propagates their block to the rest of the network. Inspired by [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), it is designed to be fast and efficient, reducing communication overhead and minimizing the amount of data a leader needs to send.

https://preview.redd.it/t9ijgbvaqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c0ee8a717f6c145ad661e1855ec49a38917e9f

Turbine achieves this by breaking down transaction data into ""shreds'' through a process called ""shredding."" Shreds are small packets of data, up to 1280 bytes, similar to individual frames in a video stream. When reassembled, these shreds allow validators to replay the entire block. The shreds are sent over the internet between validators using UDP and utilize erasure coding to handle packet loss or malicious dropping of packets. [Erasure coding](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/reedsolomon/reed_solomon_codes.html#), a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)\-based error detection and correction scheme, ensures data integrity. Even if some shreds are lost, the block can still be reconstructed.

Shreds are grouped into batches known as forward error correction (FEC) batches. By default, these batches consist of 64 shreds (32 data shreds + 32 recovery shreds). Data recovery occurs per FEC batch, meaning that up to half the packets in a batch can be lost or corrupted, and all the data can still be recovered. Each 64 shred batch is merkelized with the root being signed by the leader, and chained to the previous batch. This process ensures that shreds can be securely obtained from any node in the network that possesses them, as the chain of Merkle roots provides a verifiable path of authenticity and integrity.

The leader initially broadcasts to a single root node, which disseminates the shreds to all other validator nodes. This root node changes with each shred. Validators are organized into layers, forming the ""Turbine Tree."" Validators with a larger stake amount are typically positioned toward the top of the tree, while those with lower stakes are placed toward the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/3mflwjhcqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50409eac7cb3e07884ed130f632c95b3590541ba

The tree usually spans two or three hops, depending on the number of active validators. For visual simplicity, a fanout of 3 is depicted above, but Solana’s actual fanout value is currently set to 200. For security reasons, the order of the tree is rotated for each new batch of shreds.

The primary goal of such a system is to alleviate the outbound data egress pressure on the leader and root nodes. By utilizing a system of transmit and retransmit, the load is distributed between the leader and the retransmitters, reducing the strain on any single node.

# Consensus

*“Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana… I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive” — Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder*

Once a validator receives a new block from the leader via Turbine, it must validate all transactions within each entry. This involves replaying the entire block, validating the PoH hashes in parallel, recreating the transactions in the sequence dictated by PoH, and updating its local bank. 

[**https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png**](https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png)

This process is handled by the Transaction Validation Unit (TVU), which is analogous to the leader’s Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), serving as the core logic responsible for processing shreds and block validation. Like the TPU, the TVU flow is broken down into several stages, starting with the Shred Fetch Stage where shreds are received over Turbine. In the subsequent Shred Verify Leader Signature Stage, the shreds undergo multiple sanity checks, most notably the verification of the leader’s signature, which ensures that the received shreds originated from the leader. 

‍In the Retransmit Stage, the validator, based on its location in the Turbine tree, forwards the shreds to the appropriate downstream validators. In the Replay Stage, the validator recreates each transaction exactly and in the correct order while updating its local version of the bank.

‍The Replay Stage is analogous to the banking stage in the TPU; it is the most important stage and can be more directly described as the block validation stage. Replay is a single-threaded process loop that orchestrates many key operations, including voting, resetting the PoH clock, and switching banks.

Reddit,ethereum,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-09 13:11:10,"Hey folks, happy new year. This was popular on r/ethdev, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT***\*: They just extended the application deadline to January 11th, so I’d apply ASAP if interested\*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

Reddit,ethereum,Staking with DVT- Options?,2025-01-09 19:22:31,"Staking is a fundamental part of the new Ethereum ecosystem, focused on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where users can earn rewards while participating in securing the network.

  
However, the growing centralization of power in the hands of a few institutional entities has raised alarms for quite some time about the risks this poses to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum blockchain network.

For this reason, today the integration of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) in staking offers a more resilient and decentralized alternative that addresses concerns about the deficiencies in traditional centralized staking platforms.

  
Options?:

  
\* SafeStake

\* Obol

\* Diva Protocol

\* SSV Network

\* Lido (=??)

\* Rocketpool (=??)

Reddit,ethereum,wanted: graphic from an article I can’t seem to find ‘ethereum is like a space colony’?,2025-01-09 14:39:29,"It looked nothing like this but this is the vibe. Toon style, vibrant colors kind of the product design translucent objects machine vibes some protocols use

Anyways yhe article was from 2 years ago or so. Some big brain and was actually very cool and informative (almost certain it was published on Medium). The cover image stuck with me though

Title was something like:

Ethereum is like a space colony // defi is like a base on mars // web3 is like a space station

I tried searching a bunch of alternatives. Idea was that all these separate moving parts make up this cool ecosystem like a space colony. Maker was in it, Uniswap, other big protocols had their own little base or building and thing were connecting. I think newer protocol was landing it’s ship and plugging in

Pretty sure is was specifically about Ethereum and not all of defi/web3.. but throwing it out there it could have been. The colors of the cover were light and similar to general EF tones.

Been searching for days and can’t find, hopefully someone remembers the actual article (cause I’d like to re-read it as well as reference the cover lol)

Reddit,ethereum,Built a tool for managing & sharing ETH/ERC-20 addresses professionally (Satosh.me),2025-01-08 20:02:47,"Hey Ethereum community! Built something I think could be useful for everyone dealing with multiple ETH/ERC-20 addresses.

**What it is:**

A simple tool ([Satosh.me](http://satosh.me)) that gives you a clean profile page (satosh.me/yourname) to organize and share your Ethereum addresses professionally.

**Key Ethereum Features:**

\- Support for ETH and all ERC-20 tokens

\- Clean way to share different addresses for different tokens

\- Support for ENS domains

\- Track which addresses are being engaged with

\- Dark mode interface (because Web3)

**Why I built it:**

\- Managing multiple addresses for different tokens was getting messy

\- Needed a professional way to share addresses with clients/community

\- Wanted analytics on which addresses get used

\- Tired of copying/pasting addresses from different places

**Technical Details:**

\- No custody of private keys

\- Just manages public addresses

\- Built on Next.js/React

\- Simple dashboard for address management

Everything's free for basic use, with a Pro tier for advanced features (30-day trial available).

Live at: [satosh.me](http://satosh.me)

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

\*\* This tool does not have a limit to how many words are missing, it will for example accept 3, 4, 5 words, but the fewer the words - the exponentially longer it will take (YEARS, DECADES etc) and more computing power required to achieve the search and recovery the correct seed.

Reddit,ethereum,A few questions to staking Ethereum,2025-01-05 03:55:29,"Starting to take crypto seriously after taking a break for 2 years after investing in altcoin. Now mostly Ethereum.  
  
A few questions I have about staking and cold wallet.  
I know most people here likes to stake in Rocketpool because of decentralization.

1. Why must one convert from ETH to rETH to stake? why can't we just stake ETH?

2. How do I safely stake my ETH directly from my cold wallet?

3. Won't there be depegging from ETH to rETH?

4. I know there are risks, but what are the chances of my funds being lost in Rocketpool?",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,ethereum,"""Vitalik Buterin Deserves a Nobel Prize in Economics for His Work on Crypto and Ethereum."": Bankless Co-Founder Ryan Sean Adams",2025-01-03 14:32:32,"In a tweet Ryan Sean Adams - co-founder of Bankless - said that Vitalik Buterin should be recognized with a Nobel prize in economics for his contributions to Ethereum and the entire crypto space. He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

I wonder if one day Vitalik will be remembered as one of the greatest economic innovators of our time",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

I've used etherscan gas tracker and used the current gwei to calculate the price, but it is out by a factor of 100 from what I am quoted by CoinBase.

21000 \* 8 = 168000 = 0.000168 ETH = £0.49

CB total cost = £40 / £20 of this is network fee

I simply just do not understand how to calculate this fee or the total cost and CoinBase aren't much help.

Reddit,ethereum,The Next Upgrade and Global Adoption 2025,2025-01-02 05:29:45,"##**Tech and upgrades coming in 2025**

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

Can someone explain the difference between EIP-7702 – *which will be included in the Pectra upgrade* – and EIP-4337 – *which has been deployed in 2023* – regarding Account Abstraction (AA)?

As far as I understand it, EIP-7702 will allow:  
\- gasless transactions / gas sponsoring: the user could pay in another token like USDC.

\- transactions budling

  
But I thought this was already possible with EIP-4337. What does EIP-7702 brings on the AA, compared to EIP-4337?

I did the exact same thing for Eth.

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

I am no crypto expert, can anyone here help me  find my money ?

Ps : wrote to revolut, they said they don’t know where is the money, and that they are looking

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

Please help

EDIT : Turns out Gatehub sent BTC and ETH on XRP network which is not managed by Revolut. But they still found a way to recover the funds !! So money is safe for now 🤙🏼

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

I’ve been messing around with Solidity and doing some tutorials to get a feel for how everything works. My goal is to eventually create my own project—something small and manageable for now, but hopefully useful or at least a good learning experience.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

I’m looking forward to learning from this community and (fingers crossed) sharing something cool soon!",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Considering debt is one of the largest markets on earth beyond derivatives, I can't help but ask - how can we build non-collateralized debt markets on Ethereum? Are there any current leaders I should be looking out for? How do we hold addresses and users accountable for credit debts? Could credit agencies or banks start working with the Ethereum blockchain? Is it even possible to do this? Looking for any and all insights! ",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,ethereum,Why we should stop considering hardware & software wallets as wallets. Smart Wallets are the real wallets.,2024-12-29 16:12:24,"I'm trying to have a discussion here about the terminology in Crytpos – especially in Ethereum space.

The term *wallet* is confusing because it refers to many different things, with very different way of working and different levels of security.

***

A **Software wallet (SfW)** – *like Metamask* – is just a *keyring*: it holds a key or a set of keys. It doesn’t hold funds – but rather the keys that give access to your funds. It's a software client used to keep your keys safe and interact with your wallet (where your funds are).

A **Hardware wallet (HW)** – *like Ledger, Trezor or even Tangem* – is also just a keyring. It is safer than a software wallet because the keys stay on a physical device and can't be accessed remotely.

**But both of them are a single point of failure.**

A **Wallet** – alone –is still a bit confusing because it may refer to 2 sligthly different things:
- a *public address*, which actually holds your funds.
- all *public addresses* derived from the same seedphrase.

But, either it is 1 address or several public addresses, the term ""wallet"" is well suited here (than in SfW and HW in my opinion) because it effectively stores your funds – like a real wallet stores your money bills.

A **Smart wallet or Smart Contract Wallets (SCW)** – *like Safe Wallet* – *is* a wallet because it does hold funds too (by *Smart wallets*, I'm talking about smart accounts based wallets).  
It is called *smart* – *which is not* – because it is programmable and can have any features that make it incredibly more powerful and secure: multisig, social recovery, spending limits, access management, recurring payments, etc.

***

In a nutshell, SfW and HW are **keys** to access your Wallet – *your Externally Owned Address address* – or your SCW – *a contract address that you own*.
So, rather than called SfW and HW ""wallets"", why not using a less confusing term like ""keyring"", ""keyring client"" or even ""web3 client""?

Reddit,ethereum,Those living in Canada: Do you save up in USDC?,2024-12-28 18:33:37,"Hi!

With the decline of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, are you considering creating your emergency fund in USD?
For sure, you can open an USD account in a traditional bank but do you also consider buying USDC (or other tokens)?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to have a discussion regarding **how relevant (or nor) is it to save up in USDC for a Canadian.** I know a lot of Canadians are already investing in USD anyway.
**Does saving up directly on a USD stablecoin make any sense?**


How I see it:

**Advantages**
- less fees (maybe not, I really don't know what are the fees for a USD account opened in Canada)
- easy to buy 

**Disadvantages**
- **taxes implications?** If you pay your transaction fees in ETH, technically you may have to pay taxes on it (depending on your ACB). Plus, since ERC-20 tokens are considered assets in Canada, you should pay taxes if you make a gain when you spend your USDC (*if USD(C)/CAD goes up in value across time, which is the current consensus*)
- **not easy to spend USD** outside of Crypto space (but crypto cards are democratizing)",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,ethereum,Is it possible to run a state only node ?,2024-12-28 12:11:33,"Hey,

I'm not really sure how different Ethereum is from Bitcoin in client logic. From my understanding, there are transactions and state (smart contract values, etc...).

In my case, I need to access the read-only features of some smart contracts without spending too much on hardware. 

My current solution was to use an rpc provider, request the state of contract x, then listen for new blocks and update the state on my end based on the transactions received. This is necessary to avoid hitting rate limits, as my usage uses a large number of requests.

The problem is that the ""sync"" part can take days with the current rate limit because I'm using contract calls, which probably isn't the best solution. So I wanted to know if it was possible to run a node without the whole blockchain, just with the state, the goal is not to verify transactions but to know more efficiently the state of specific contracts.

Do you know if this is possible? if not, is it difficult to create my own implementation to request this directly on the network like real nodes do, and include my logic instead?

A kind of ethereum client that  sync only a specific part of the state and does not store or verify transactions",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644
Reddit,ethereum,Can somebody explain how people are still paying $23 or over that for gas fees in the second half of 2024?,2024-12-27 17:18:42,"Hi. I was just following an ETH thread in the cryptocurrency subreddit and various people are claiming they are paying about $30 or even more than that for their gas fees for L1 transactions.

For example, [I saw this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hm4k11/comment/m3tigd0/
):

> Yeah I try to swap $45 worth of ETH for a coin I want and it's costing me $23 gas fees. No thanks. 

I have read other comments in the past few weeks of people still paying something like upper $20 range for gas fees, and I assume their transactions were recently?

How is this possible though?  Checking the gas fee chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#1y, the highest average gas fee in the last 6 months was $14 USD on November 13th.  The gas fee has generally been lower than that in the last 6 months for Ethereum.

I haven't seen any average gas fee over $20 USD since March of 2024 according to that chart.  So how are people still paying like $23, or even in the upper $20 range for their gas fees lately?",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

I heard about Bitcoin in 2011, it had just spiked to an ATH of $8, so I thought I would give mining it a try.

The first few days, I was mining 1BTC/day.  Mining rate slowed drastically as BTC gained popularity.

I was sending my BTC to MtGox as it was mined, until the price of BTC crashed again.  I evidently lost interest, and promptly forgot about the \~$20 of BTC I had accumulated.

Come 2014, MtGox shuts down, taking 2/3 of my BTC with it.  I wrote it off entirely, lamenting my loss of a couple hundred $.

2021 rolls around, BTC is at an ATH of $50k.  I hear about the Mt Gox settlement, wondering if I still have my account info.  I can't find it.  
What I *do* find is my old wallet, and see there's still 2BTC in it.

Last month, when BTC hits $100k, I finally decide it's time to cash out the majority of it, for a down payment on a house later this year.

Reddit,bitcoin,The US Government wanting to hold Bitcoin is the biggest inflation warning of my lifetime.,2025-01-09 22:15:51,"They can't call it a strategic reserve. The issuer of the most powerful currency in the world can't just say to the world, ""We're going to hold Bitcoin as a hedge against the dollar ... but it's cool. Just go about your business."" They can't openly undermine the only currency that they can print themselves. It would panic the world. It's basically an admission that they're going to try to print their way out of the debt crisis. 

Everyone else in the world can hold Bitcoin and it's OK. Every other country can accumulate it and it will just be seen as prudent. But not the USA. We are the only ones with control over printing the dollar. The more Bitcoin that the US government tries to quietly accumulate, the more you'll know that the dollar is in big trouble. And the US is f\*\*ked ... because they're the only ones who can't protect themselves. (Not openly anyway.) 

Addendum:
Lots of debate in this thread about the true meaning of a strategic reserve. I will offer this from chat gpt: 

A strategic reserve is a stockpile of a commodity, like oil, that a government or organization holds back from normal use to be released during unexpected events or disruptions in supply, allowing them to manage crises and stabilize markets by providing a readily available source of that commodity when needed; essentially acting as an emergency buffer against sudden shortages. 

But we don't have to debate the purpose of this reserve.  It's stated explicitly in the bill. 

(3) Just as gold reserves have historically served as a cornerstone of national financial security, Bitcoin represents a digital-age asset capable of enhancing the financial leadership and security of the United States in the 21st century global economy.

(4) The acquisition and long-term storage of substantial quantities of Bitcoin by the United States can strengthen the financial condition of the United States, providing a hedge against economic uncertainty and monetary instability.

(5) Bitcoin, as a decentralized and finitely scarce digital asset, offers unique properties that complement existing national reserves, strengthening the position of the United States dollar in the global financial system.

(6) Diversification of the national assets of the United States to include Bitcoin can enhance financial resilience and position the United States at the forefront of global financial innovation.

It's all about strengthening the US dollar. It isn't farm equipment.  It isn't cheese. It isn't even gold. It's a non inflatable store of value that will presumably shore up the dollar. (While undermining the reputation of the US dollar. ",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,Don’t you think that bitcoiners are a bit too fanatical?,2025-01-09 20:24:05,"Basically this. I’m generally a skeptical guy which led me to diving into a rabbit hole and thoroughly research crypto before I bought it. I personably believe in bitcoin’s future, thus buy and keep it. 

However, I always get even more skeptical when I see too many people too excited over something. I don’t know many people who buy bitcoin outside of Reddit, but the things I see people say in here make me question if I’m just caught up in the hype sometimes. 

I even visited the buttcoin sub to see if there’s anything that would make me change my mind. So far, nothing changed my opinion on buying crypto. But both bitcoin and buttcoin subs seem a tad too…emotional? About their beliefs.

I normally lean towards the opinion that would recognize both pros and cons. But the things I see on Reddit are either “we will all become billionaires so hodl to your last breath” or “these idiots will lose every penny and they deserve it” type of stuff. 

That genuinely baffles me. Bitcoin does seem to have a lot of potential to be much bigger in the future than it is, but I’m not even sure if the posters in here buy it as a mean to save their money or to satiate their gambling needs.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,Orange Pilled My Partner,2025-01-10 11:31:56,"This week I orange pilled my girlfriend.

A little backstory here. I have been buying Bitcoin since 2020 and dabbled in other shitcoins at the time. The past 2 years I woke up and have been purely buying Bitcoin, bought a hardware wallet, backed up my seed phrase on stamped metal washers and have been DCAing the entire time.

My partner has always been poor with money and has a fairly large chunk of debt through stupid pay day loans and overdrafts so in Autumn last year, she sold her car in order to clear some debt. Over Christmas and going into this year she had struggled without a car (we live rurally and have no public transport links) so she wanted to buy a new car to use for work.

We found a car, but as she'd put all her money into paying off debt, she has no savings. So, I leant her a chunk of money for a deposit on a sensible reliable car and she was going to pay me back each month.

I have spoken a lot about Bitcoin with her but she never really understood it, but I've given her an incentive to buy some. I got her to set up an account with Strike and have requested for her to DCA into Strike instead of paying me back and she has done exactly that.

Now she keeps asking more and more questions about Bitcoin and she's really starting to understand the benefits that it can offer to all of our lives. The next step is getting her set up with a hardware wallet, but that is another topic for later!",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,Solo mining on my own node - does maxuploadtarget matters?,2025-01-10 08:26:34,"Just for fun and learning, I have purchased one of those small home lottery miners. Since I already use my own full node for making BTC transactions, I thought I would also use it for my miner. 

I have successfully set up a cksolo pool instance and pointed it to my node. The miner is working fine and everything looks good. 

Now, my question is, given that my home setup has limited bandwidth (data-wise), I have already limited the usage using maxuploadtarget=500MB in my Bitcoin Core configuration. This limits the number of historical blocks that can be downloaded from me by other nodes. 

In the very unlikely scenario that I find a proper block, would these settings be compliant? What I mean is, if my node has already done a 500MB upload, will it still be able to push my newly found block to other connected nodes? My understanding is that it should work, as this option should only affect historical blocks, but I'm not 100% sure.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,My son set up his first cold wallet,2025-01-09 19:40:07,"I'm proud to share that my son set up his first cold wallet yesterday. Most of all I'm proud of the questions he asked during the process and the decisions he made to manage the risks of self-custody.

He generally followed Coinkite's ""medium grade"" instructions for initializing a ColdCard hardware wallet, including verifying the authenticity of the device itself and the latest firmware, and for updating the firmware on the device using an air gapped microSD card. He used dice rolls to add randomness to the entropy from the device's TRNG, and added a passphrase to the seed.

He recorded all of the recovery information, including the derivation path, the wallet's fingerprint and first four addresses on paper, then reset the ColdCard (using the ""destroy seed"" command). He then recovered the wallet on the ColdCard and verified the fingerprint and the first four addresses. All of this was done offline, powering the device from a USB adapter rather than plugging it into a computer. (He tried using a USB battery brick but the one he had kept shutting down due to too little current drawn by the ColdCard.)

Having proved that his recovery information was complete and accurate, he exported the extended public key as an Electrum watch-only wallet file onto a microSD card and imported it into Electrum on a PC that doesn't leave the house. In Electrum, he verified the wallet's fingerprint and the first four addresses.

He stamped his 24-word seed mnemonic into numbered, stainless steel washers and sealed the washers in a watertight container which will be stored in a non-obvious but easily memorable location at home. His passphrase is stored digitally in a reputable cloud password keeper. We're evaluating options for secure storage of second copies of both the mnemonic and the passphrase in geographically separate locations. He's also considering putting a small amount of coins in the passphrase-less wallet that one would get from only the mnemonic as a ""tripwire"" to detect that the mnemonic has been compromised (especially after he puts redundant copies of it in other geo locations).

Having created permanent, accessible copies of the mnemonic and passphrase, he then reset the ColdCard a final time. Since he has no plans to spend from his wallet for at least five years, he decided he doesn't need a ready-to-use signing device, and he doesn't want a PIN--another secret which would need to be stored securely--to be the only thing that prevents someone who might find the ColdCard from stealing his coins. 

**There are now ZERO devices in the world that can sign transactions from his cold wallet.** There are no single points of compromise (where someone who finds *some* of the recovery information can easily discover the rest of the recovery information) and soon there will be no single points of failure (where the loss or inaccessibility of one of his stored secrets will prevent him from recovering his wallet).

He's ready to make his first Bitcoin transfer from an exchange to the watch-only wallet. I think he's covered his bases for privacy, redundancy, theft-proofing and seizure-proofing appropriately. His stack, though not small, is not yet a fortune so he decided the extra assurances in Coinkite's ""paranoid"" guide (for example, proving that Coinkite's dice roll algorithm doesn't cheat) were overkill for him. That being said, is there anything you would have done differently?",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,California Fires and Bitcoin,2025-01-09 16:45:39,"First responder and Bitcoin maxi here. There is nothing like working for the government to make you not trust it. I cannot express the amount of devastation I've seen over the last two days. It felt like I was in the middle of a war zone. Fires, explosions, power outages, injured people, people refusing to leave their residences as they were going up in flames, helpless people trying to recover what they could—99 % of what they owned gone in an instant.

It's important to note that these people did not live in the mountains or hills. We are several miles from the base of the closest mountain. These are populated communities. This could happen anywhere at any time, something I did not fully understand until the last two days.

How is this relative to Bitcoin.

1. Seed phrases and self custody.

I've preached this several times before. If you self custody any meaningful amount, you should use multi-sig with geographically dispersed keys. Splitting one key in half or three locations is not a good idea. Suppose you lose one part of that; you won't be able to recover anything. You can also look into Bitcoin-only companies who assist with multi-sig. Unchained and SWAN are two off the top of my head. You hold two keys; they hold one. You can still recover your funds if you lose or have one key compromised.

Edit: Put your keys onto fireproof steel. Then you have a chance to recover it. That being said, we have also had some looting. If your house burns down and you can't get back to it for a day or two, your seed (if recovered) may already be compromised. This further enforces the multi-sig point.

2) Bitcoin is a safer investment than real estate.

""You can't live in a Bitcoin"" - Very true. But I can rent and put the excess money into Bitcoin. I hope insurance helps people who have lost everything. Even if they are compensated financially, the process will take years, and they will never truly make up for the property they lost. Bitcoin does not have nearly as much counterparty risk. Matthew Kratter has two great videos on this subject: [https://youtu.be/0l-mlHw3Bz0?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/0l-mlHw3Bz0?feature=shared) and [https://youtu.be/7uYVcDa\_t6M?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/7uYVcDa_t6M?feature=shared) . Although I had already watched these videos and agreed to some extent, the last few days have hammered these points home.

Just remember, devastation like this can happen to you, no matter where you are. Plan accordingly.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,Is this a safe way to store seed phrase?,2025-01-10 09:38:25,"I was thinking about how to safely store a 12 word seed phrase and wondered if this makes sense?

Get six stainless steel washers.

Location 2
Seed words 5-8 & seed words 9-12

Location 3

That way no single location has the full phrase, but you could make the full phrase with any two of the three location’s washers.

I have a fair to poor memory. Today there are likely dozens of people wishing that they could remember their (now burned up) seed phrases.

To remember my words, I learned a technique used by memory competitors called a mind palace. The mind palace technique dates back to ancient Grece and it’s used in some form by every memory competitor in some form. It involves picking a particular space that you are familiar with and projecting images into the space.

For example, I used my finished basement. You can use any room that you are very familiar with … your garage, your bedroom, bathroom etc. Walk around the room in a circle and pick out 12 items. A fireplace, a lamp, a sink, a wall hanging, a chair. Choose 12 distinct and somewhat evenly spaced real items. Then walk from one item to the next and create a vivid visual image the incorporates your seed word with that item. Perhaps the item is a lamp and your seed word is “crush”. Imagine a hand crushing the lamp. Visualize it in detail. The light going out. Pieces of glass flying. The sound of shattering. The more you incorporate all of your senses, the better you will remember … crush. Perhaps your next item is a chair. Your second word is obscure. You imagine a magician sitting in the chair with a shiny object in his hand. When he sees you, he covers it up and then reveals it to you. He does this over and over again. Stand and watch him do it in your mind and say to yourself, “Obscure.”

(Note that there are many meanings to the word obscure. That’s not important. What does it visually look like to YOU to obscure or be obscure. Is it a music artist who nobody knows about? Put them in the chair. Is it a shadowy figure in the fog? …in the chair. Picture it and say obscure.)

Do this for all twelve of your keywords. Physically walk around the room. See, hear and smell them all as vividly as possible. Circle the room once or twice. Later that day, see the room in your mind. Walk around it and say your words. When you enter that room over the next week, walk around and say all the words again. Within a week the words will be ingrained in your long-term memory. They will be unforgettable.

I don’t feel like this replaces the need to write down and store my words in a safe location, which has been discussed at length here. I feel like the safest method is to have one copy in my brain and one copy in the word. If the seed words get destroyed in the world for any reason, my brain is the backup. If my brain fails for any reason, the world is my backup.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Looking for a BTC/crypto card that:

Holds money in BTC and auto-converts to fiat at payment/POS (ideally converts incoming fiat to BTC automatically also). Reputable provider with low fees are of course welcomed.

Have EU and AU passports (mostly in Thailand/traveling tho). Want direct BTC spending / automatic conversation - not like Revolut's manual conversion. And no platform tokens like Crypto.com's - just BTC.

Which provider would you recommend? (I used Nuri in the past but the they closed)

Should I register with EU or AU address? Seems to make a difference.

AI suggests Coinbase with EU address, but CoinJar with AU address was recommend a year ago here.

Any thoughts? Thanks!",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,A Bitcoin private key security compared to your passwords...,2025-01-09 18:42:46,"So I got a private key example at bitcoin.it (wiki), modified it just a bit and hilariously got this don’t import message in the middle of it:

_SAMPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_DO_NOT_IMPORT_

Below is how I cut it out to paste into the password strength meter, and below that is how it originally shows up when you try to copy and paste it without modification:

E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33141

E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389_SAMPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_DO_NOT_IMPORT_F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262

And the password strength meter result:

“Time to crack your password:

4 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years”

-  Another way to look at it:

 To crack a private key you would need to guess the correct series of head/tails 256 times in a row as you flip a coin…

Passwordmoster.com come says:

“Review: Fantastic, using that password makes you as secure as Fort Knox.”

As I just redid a password for another login and using their maximum of 20 characters I got this:

13 billion trillion years to crack.

So it looks like in this example a bitcoin private key is about .3077 trillion trillion trillion trillion years better as a multiple of the 20 character password strength.

 Anybody want to take a crack at the math here?

Reddit,bitcoin,Bet against the system,2025-01-09 23:54:29,"Crypto sparked my interest in the financial system and I've been learning about the topic since I started back in 2021. 

&nbsp;

I can't say I've nearly grasped all of it, but here are some takeaways that lead to my conclusion.

&nbsp;

Money is a right to goods and services out of the system, as a reward for providing goods and service to the system. 

&nbsp;

Money is not a thing, it's a concept. 

&nbsp;

Theoretically there should never be more money than unclaimed goods and services in circulation. 

&nbsp;

Of course that is hard to realise in practice. 

&nbsp;

It also doesn't consider credit. 

&nbsp;

Credit is a promiss for goods and services, for a major sum of goods and services coupons. 

&nbsp;

The money is created out of thin air.
No service or good has been provided and there is abstract guarantee for the promised good or service to be worth the coupons granted. 
This is especially hard to judge for services like coaching and consulting. Since good credit is only granted to credit worthy, e.g. wealthy people, new money stays in these circles. 
People get paid someones yearly salary in plumbing on a single day, to advice someone to fire half of the staff and raise the price. 
Is that worth the same to society? I'll let you be the judge o that. 

&nbsp;

That money has no value at the second of creation.
Or even worse, technically it wateres down the worth of everyone else's truly earned money. 

&nbsp;

At a projected rate of ""symmetrical 2% inflation"", aimed for by the European central bank (EZB). 

&nbsp;

Sure, Credits also allow for small company's to start business, but these credits mostly have interest rates to high, to actually beat inflation. Therefore you're the product in the supermarkets, at the bank and on social media. 

&nbsp;

Credits aren't the only problem, but I feel like that's where the frog has it's bangles. I feel like the next biggest problem would be the obligation to maximise profits for shareholders. I don't want to get into it too much tho, it kind of speaks for itself. 

&nbsp;

We live on a limited planet, with material cycles, that luckily balance the exact way, that it's possible for us to live. 

&nbsp;

Please zoom out for a moment. Like really far out. Life on earth started 3.8 billion years ago. Oxigen as a redox equivalent became the meta around 1.5 billion later. This planet had 5 mass extinctions, with this century arguably becoming the sixth. 

&nbsp;

It is by far not to be taken for granted, that our climate is the way it is now. This planet doesn't give a shit about us. If we continue to fuck up the balance in every single material cycle that supplies us with THE FUCKING ATOMS AT THE RIGHT DOSAGE THAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE. DO YALL KNOW ABOUT F*CKIN FOREVER CHEMICALS? 

&nbsp;

Sorry... +3°C average, means, that weather extremes will become 10-15°C more extreme and increase in rate and intensity, because higher heat means higher combustion, meaning bigger clouds meaning badder storms. 

&nbsp;

It's not that hard y'all, pick up a science book. We're fucked. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

If you still read this, thank you <3 

&nbsp;

I will now close the circle to how bitcoin comes into play. 

&nbsp;

Companys are incentivised to maximise profits. 

&nbsp;

Bitcoin is the most promising newcomer to serious finance in decades. 

&nbsp;

And that makes it a self fulfilling prophecy. More company's conclude, that way more company's buy, yada yada yada... 

&nbsp;

The thing is. Bitcoin will keep delivering. As long as every cicle manages to increase the userbase even just slightly. It will come back every four years and reap dumb money. 

&nbsp;

This happens exponentially, because of the halving, every four years there is double the people in the community for the same amount of new BTC. Sooner or later, this will blow out of proportion. 

&nbsp;

Since financial markets are financial markets, it will be possible to lend against your BTC ETF and trade derivatives. That allows BlackRock and co to lend absurd amounts of money. Money they will throw into bitcoin and use the rest to absurdly water down the value of real work. 

&nbsp;

Sooner or later the dollar isn't worth shit. And we will have to find some solution other then inflationary monetary systems. 

&nbsp;

I can't really grasp the implications and I might just be insane but I would love to hear y'all's thoughts. Stay friendly and have fun debating :)",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,bitcoin,"For Those Who Read ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous",2025-01-08 15:08:10,"What was your biggest aha moment???

For me it was realizing that money as a medium of exchange flows to the hardest asset or the asset with the most salability (stock to flow ratio). So when I looked up the market cap of gold (considered the worldwide standard for hardest asset) and saw that it's $18T and did the math on the 20M coins in circulation. I realized that the eventual long-term equilibrium price of the market cap of Bitcoin will have to settle to at least this price of $18T whether any individual or government likes it or not. Even if they try to fight it, it's a huge uphill battle. This would put the eventual price of Bitcoin at $900,000 per coin when it reaches equilibrium.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Guess how many private keys were lost during that LA fire?,2025-01-10 06:59:06,"That fire in LA was one of my biggest security concern for my keys also = my home getting burned down when I'm away.

Can't store your private keys on your phone. It's a piece of paper people often keep it where it's safest (their homes). Aside from breaking ins and theft, fire hazard is the biggest risk. Wouldn't wish it on anybody to go for a trip and then come back to a burned down house where possibly a piece of paper inside is worth more than the house and land. Well, unless you have one of these metallic private keys but I think not everyone has them. Also it's easier said than done, but finding a piece of tiny square amidst a burned down house with tons of ash, debris, wood, etc. is harder than you might think.

People are reporting house values but we still don't know what the crypto values are and I'm sure they must have kept some there.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Aerobud - The only memecoin that actually does some good for the world,2025-01-10 11:23:08,"

Hello everyone, I was wondering to which extent the wider crypto community has ever heard of the project Aerobud. Built on the Base network, it's a project that seeks out to save dogs in need, by actively donating to animal shelters. Here's why it's such a gem that many, many people are sleeping on.

**1. A Pawsitive Impact:**

* Aerobud isn't just about riding the meme wave; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of animals. They actively partner with and donate to animal shelters, providing much-needed resources and raising awareness for animal welfare. This charitable mission resonates with a large and passionate community of animal lovers, giving Aerobud a unique appeal and a strong foundation for growth.
* This commitment to a cause provides a sense of purpose beyond just financial gain, fostering a loyal and engaged community that's invested in the project's long-term success.

**2. The Power of Community:**

* Aerobud understands that a strong community is the backbone of any successful memecoin. They cultivate a welcoming and inclusive environment where members feel valued and heard. This fosters a sense of belonging and shared purpose, which is crucial for driving organic growth and weathering market volatility.
* The team actively engages with the community through regular AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions), social media interactions, and community events. This open communication builds trust and ensures that everyone feels like they're part of the Aerobud journey.

**3. Transparency is Key:**

* In the often murky world of memecoins, Aerobud shines a light with its commitment to transparency. They are open about their marketing strategies, tokenomics, and charitable donations. This builds trust and credibility within the community, which is essential for long-term success.
* Regular updates and clear communication about the project's progress and financial activities demonstrate accountability and reassure investors that their funds are being used responsibly.

**Beyond the Basics:**

* Aerobud also boasts a strong and experienced team with a clear vision for the future. They are constantly working on new initiatives and partnerships to expand the project's reach and impact.
* With its unique blend of meme appeal, charitable purpose, and community focus, Aerobud has the potential to become much more than just a fleeting trend. It has the ingredients to build a sustainable and impactful presence in the crypto world.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Bhutan Strategic Digital Reserves ,2025-01-10 02:00:15,"Gelephu Mindfulness City, Bhutan – [January 8, 2025] Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC), Bhutan’s new Special Administration Region, today announced its intention to recognise digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and BNB as part of its strategic reserves, making the Special Administrative Region (SAR) one of the first jurisdictions to officially hold digital assets as part of its strategic reserves. The inclusion of digital assets in the GMC’s strategic reserves will enhance the SAR’s economic resilience, and is an evolution of the jurisdiction’s involvement in bitcoin mining.

For its strategic reserves, GMC intends to recognise digital assets that have large market capitalisations and deep liquidity to ensure that they can be easily bought and sold with minimal price impact. In addition, GMC will look to recognise digital assets that are issued on more mature, secure blockchains that support monitoring of on-chain transactions.

The timing sucks. There is not much I can do about it. I can probably push my selling past January 20th. It still feels weird. I've taken profits before. The annoying part is that I know I'm missing out on the bull run with those 10%. If I wasn't so sure, or if it was late 2022 I wouldnt even think twice about it. All those positions are in profit so it't not as if I was taking a hit on any of them. Yet it still bothers me that this is some terrible timing. 

I'm thinking of taking an equal piece from BTC ETH and SOL. What are your thoughts? Shift the percentages for less long term losses? 

I'm open to ideas. I looked at lending out those three. I don't know if exposing myself to the additional risk is worth it. I'm not a fan of leverage and lending out feels similiar even though it is quite different. 70% LTV on Binance but this is cryptoland not real estate to put up. 

Why do I not have the 10% in savings, you may ask. It's simple. Cash is trash. I keep the money busy, be it in crypto or other assets. I'm... Cash broke? Seems like the right term! ",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

This is primarily due to the uncertainty of the crypto market in an adoption standpoint - sure Trump and his administration are pro crypto but there is going to be a lot of steps to get where everyone wants and pushback along the way. Keep in mind that Bitcoin already went up 100%  in just the last year! Say it does get regulated, institutional money is going to be in the driver’s seat from then on- and I hate to say this, but I’m 99% sure they are not investing in anything without utility for real world purposes. With saying that however, maybe retail does continue trading and swinging memes. Nobody knows. I don’t mean to freak anyone out with this but it is definitely a bigger gamble than what it was in 2016/2021. Personally, I would wait until inauguration and see what the market does, but I wouldn’t be expecting some crazy 10-100x spikes like before and all these YouTubers and TikTokers are just PnD scheming you and don’t know shit. Again I truly believe this is not the same as previous cycles due to institutional $$$ involved so just be cautious with any memes for that matter.

I'd say last year was all about learning, experimenting, and ensuring my decision making became better. Although, there's still a lot to learn, I've decided to take it a step further and set some personal targets for this year trading wise.  

I want to increase my profits, towards the end of last year I was making consistent profits but because of my risk management it wasn't a lot. I don't intend to outrageously increase my risks, I'd be sticking to the same system but I'd be increasing my capital.  I basically want to become a better trader. 

I'd also like to diversify my portfolio, and I'd like to explore some smaller altcoins with potential instead of sticking to the big 2, and I'd appreciate whatever recommendations I can get.

I keep getting downvoted and told this is all fake and too good to be true. You just inspired me to keep posting because I know there are people out there that know what value looks like. So, here we go:

**Name of the token**: OriginTrail (Trac)

**Token supply**: 500 million

**ICO price 2018**: $0,10 pr. token

**Current price**: $0,74

**Current ROI from ICO**: 740%

**Network revenue 2023**: 1,183,000 Trac

**Network revenue 2024**: 7,705,000 Trac 

**Network revenue 2025** (est. *forecast based on current numbers*): 25,500,000 Trac

([Newest iteration released 2 weeks ago is expected to scale the network by x1000. We are already seeing this reflect in the demand for the Trac token](https://docs.origintrail.io/dkg-v8-current-version/whats-new-with-origintrail-v8) and forecasted revenue).

Nodes, staking, network revenue can all be found here: [https://staking.origintrail.io/](https://staking.origintrail.io/) . Some nodes related to known businesses and people:

\- Swiss Railways is running 3 nodes on all 3 different chains a 2 million Trac. **All called SBB**.

\- [Bob Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe) is running his own node called ""**Metcalfe, Hook 'em Horns**""

\- [DMaaST node](https://dmaast.eu/)

Here are some facts:

* 11,700,000 million knowledge assets published yesterday alone.
* Each knowledge asset costs between 4-7 pennies on average to publish.
* These are not txn costs. This is actual data being hashed and added to the cluster of the DKG. Expected to hit 100,000,000 per day with this upgrade.
* The lower the Trac goes in price, the higher the yields for nodes and stakers. It's already undervalued as fuck. That's why the APY is rising and is sitting at 20-25% APY currently. As long as people keep ignoring this project and the network keeps growing, the APY will continue to go up.
* No treasury, no token release, no gimmicks. Businesses purchase Trac to pay nodes. Simple as that. Stop posting nonsense from other useless tokens.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why does the crypto market respond so violently to even the smallest bit of bad news?,2025-01-08 03:21:21,"The cryptocurrency market has become increasingly volatile, and this volatility often feels exaggerated compared to the actual significance of the news that triggers it. If there’s good news, prices might go up a little, but even the slightest hint of bad news seems to lead to tremendous dumps. This behavior raises questions about the motivations of market participants. Is this volatility a result of people anticipating that others will panic-sell? Are they preemptively taking profits while prices are still relatively high, intending to buy back in when the price inevitably drops lower? Or do these traders genuinely believe that the negative news warrants a reduced valuation for their assets?

It’s hard to figure out the true mindset behind these actions, especially when the news causing the market to drop often seems insignificant. For example, minor regulatory updates, rumors of market instability, or even unrelated macroeconomic events can cause massive sell-offs. This suggests that many participants are not reacting to the intrinsic value of their holdings but rather trying to outgame one another. Traders might not actually believe the news justifies a lower valuation but instead act as if it does because they think others will sell. By selling first, they aim to avoid losses and position themselves to buy back in at a lower price. This cycle perpetuates the volatility, as it’s driven more by psychological factors and herd behavior than fundamental analysis.

Another issue is that this kind of behavior creates a feedback loop. When traders dump at the first sign of trouble, it validates the fears of others who might have been on the fence about selling. This can lead to cascading sell-offs, where even those with long-term investment strategies feel compelled to exit their positions temporarily, fearing further losses. On the flip side, positive news doesn’t seem to have the same explosive impact, as gains tend to be more gradual and cautious. ",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

How it works: download .csv file of your trades, copypaste that info to the SALES worksheet.

Explanations:

* Realized PnL is the profit/loss compared to if you had sold the tokens for the price you have paid for them
* ""PnL if the remaining tokens are sold at..."" tells you the profit/loss if you sell the **remaining** tokens for 1) the same price you paid, 2) when the price paid has increased 5...60 %, 3) when the price has decreased 5...50 %
* Selling limits tells you at what price you have to sell the token for each % of PnL
* If wishing to use different percentages, simply change those to your liking

Tried to make the colour palette suitable for colour blind people too, but that is easy to edit if you dislike the colours I chose. The SALES worksheet has some conditional formatting by token names to make it easier see what you have sold/bought, remove or edit the conditional formatting if that annoys you. Also the summary worksheet has some conditional formatting to highlight profits/losses.

Used swisstransfer for this, not putting a direct link but here is the address. The download limit is 250 which should suffice, but if for some reason this gains more interest, DM me for a new link.

// As noted by a redditor in the comments, if you use LibreOffice, it might be that the formula in A8 gets weird. It should be as following: =SORT(UNIQUE(SALES!B$5:B$550)) That formula is only in the cell A8, it uses the remaining rows according to how many unique values there are. I am not using LO myself, so I am afraid I can't help if these functions itself are not working in LO as intended. Buu.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

Reddit,crypto,Storing libsodium private keys on disk,2024-12-27 19:31:38,"Hi everyone,

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-10 12:19:42.307644
