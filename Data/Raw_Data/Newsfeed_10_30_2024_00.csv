According to crypto analyst Gert van Lagen, Bitcoin’s breakout last week could signal the onset of a major price continuation phase as the bulls aim above the $70,000 mark. Particularly, Van Lagen highlighted that Bitcoin’s ability to successfully retest the upper trendline of this pattern lends strong momentum to the current bullish structure. The descending broadening wedge pattern is a reversal structure in technical analysis, often hinting at a strong trend upon breakout. Bitcoin’s ability to breach the upper trend line reinforces the likelihood of bullish momentum, lending voice to a new all-time high in the coming weeks. Bullish Retest Validates Strong Support For Next Rally At the time of van Lagen’s analysis, the Bitcoin price was retesting a bottom-sloping trend line, which has capped its price rallies since it reached an all-time high of $73,737 in March. By then, Bitcoin had already peaked out of this trend line in the descending broadening wedge and was already on the third candle.  Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge – Report As Bitcoin bounced from the upper trend line, van Lagen described this as a “successful bullish retest.” Furthermore, he noted the importance of a bullish trajectory for this pattern, highlighting that the breakout direction is upward 79% of the time.  With the Bitcoin price now successfully above this wedge, this next phase could see the cryptocurrency extend its gains and surge above $70,000. As such, the analyst also noted that reaching a new all-time high is essential to fully validating the wave continuation pattern. Key Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch While the breakout and retest offer promising technical signs, van Lagen warned of a critical downside level that traders should monitor. He pinpointed $58,700 as a crucial weekly closing price, below which the bullish structure would be invalidated. In his view, a close below this threshold would disrupt the quick wave five continuation and totally reverse the bullish setup to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $24? Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens Interestingly, Bitcoin has managed to push to the upside since this breakout. Particularly, the cryptocurrency has extended gains and has now broken above $71,000 for the first time since June. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $71,150, having reached an intraday high of $71,450 in the past 24 hours. As it stands, Bitcoin is only 3.6% away from reaching uncharted price territories. The only key price resistance level to watch at this point would be the current all-time high. Many Bitcoin metrics point to the continuation of bullish Bitcoin price momentum, at least in the short term. The Bitcoin open interest is now at its highest point of $42.6 billion, which relays a high level of trading activity among Bitcoin traders.

On Tuesday, total trading volume for spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $3 billion, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price briefly above the pivotal $73,000 mark for the first time in over 7 months.  Bitcoin ETF Market Set To Surpass 1 Million BTC Holdings Soon Notably, crypto investor BigRig observed a remarkable uptick in Bitcoin ETF purchases over the past two weeks, reporting $2.673 billion in inflows since October 16.  This accounts for a substantial 11.8% of total ETF inflows during this period, suggesting a robust interest from institutional and retail investors. BigRig also pointed out that, prior to Tuesday’s trading volume, this period represented the best day for ETF inflows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added to the optimistic narrative by stating that US spot ETFs are on track to hold 1 million Bitcoin by next Wednesday, surpassing the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, by mid-December with an average addition of about 17,000 BTC per week. However, Balchunas also cautioned that market volatility could impact these projections. “Anything can happen,” he noted, referencing the possibility of a sudden selloff that could delay the timeline.  Conversely, if prices continue to rise and political factors, such as a potential Trump victory in the upcoming election, contribute to increased market enthusiasm, the expert believes that this influx of new investors could accelerate the pace of Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs. Whale Accumulation Spurs Optimism Despite heightened activity in the Bitcoin ETF market, the price of the largest cryptocurrency recently fell short of its all-time high, retracing to approximately $72,250 at the time of writing.  However, there are positive indicators for Bitcoin bulls. The cryptocurrency has been consolidating above key support levels, with strong backing around the $66,000 mark.  This support has effectively prevented any significant decline over the past week and has contributed to the ongoing rally. However, what would be a notable bullish indicator would be a sustained consolidation above the $70,000 level for the bulls, which could further demonstrate the strength of the current move. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect Market expert Miles Deutscher has been vocal about his bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly in the latter months of the year. He recently pointed out a significant trend: whales—large holders of Bitcoin—are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an “unprecedented pace.”  This observation suggests that institutional demand for Bitcoin is currently outpacing retail interest, a shift that could have implications for massive price movements to the upside in the near future. Deutscher further highlighted that Bitcoin exchange reserves have reached all-time lows. This means that the amount of Bitcoin available on exchanges for trading has dwindled, signaling a supply squeeze. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com ",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Crypto Expert Discloses ‘Hidden Altcoin Gem’ With 1,900% Upside",2024-10-29 22:30:51+00:00,"In his latest video analysis titled “I Just APED Into This Hidden RWA Altcoin Gem! [20x Potential],” prominent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher unveiled Chintai (CHEX) as his latest high-conviction investment within the Real World Assets (RWA) sector. Deutscher believes Chintai could offer significant upside potential—up to 1,900% (20x)—in the upcoming market cycle. Deutscher has consistently highlighted RWA tokens as one of his top investment narratives, ranking third behind memecoins and AI for this crypto bull run. “When I look at narratives that can actually change the fabric of crypto and really offer a new value add, I think RWA is massive,” he stated. He emphasized the growing appeal of on-chain treasury yields, especially as traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) yields diminish and interest rates decline. The analyst previously capitalized on early investments in ONDO and Mantra (OM), both of which have seen substantial gains. ONDO, for instance, delivered a 7x return from his initial entry point. However, Deutscher now considers these assets to be reaching overvalued territories. “Valuation-wise, though, it’s pretty insane considering the fact that its market cap’s a billion, but it’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $7.1 billion,” he said regarding ONDO. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils The ‘True Time To Sell It All’: Here’s When Deutscher has been reallocating his capital into what he perceives as undervalued opportunities within the RWA space. Alongside Clearpool (CPOOL), which he mentioned has already gained 42% since his initial disclosure, Chintai (CHEX) stands out as his newest and largest RWA position. “This one I’m also really, really bullish on. It’s tough for me to say if I’m most bullish on this, but it might be the one that I’m most bullish on in the RWA sector,” he remarked. Chintai differentiates itself by being one of the few RWA-focused layer-one blockchains regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). “If you know Singapore, they are so strict with due diligence. It’s really hard to get a license; they fought for a license and they’ve got it,” Deutscher noted. This regulatory approval positions Chintai to attract significant institutional capital, potentially channeling billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL) onto their chain. The analyst highlighted Chintai’s robust fundamentals, including its extensive list of major clients and partnerships, such as DHC, Finstable, and Greengate. “They are basically a marketplace for tokenization, an L1 blockchain for RWA tokenization,” he explained. The platform has already facilitated over $630 million worth of loans and is set to launch “OZEAN,” a blockchain for RWA yield supported by Optimism, early next year. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run From a valuation perspective, Deutscher sees substantial upside potential. Chintai currently has an FDV of approximately $250 million, significantly lower than Mantra’s $1.37 billion FDV. “If CHEX—even in a static market without the market growing at all—does a 6x, that’s just now matching Mantra,” he calculated. Considering the potential growth of the RWA market, the upside could be even more pronounced. “What if the RWA market 2x’s? Because I think it’s going to be a very strong narrative next year; then you could be looking at a 14x.” Despite its strong fundamentals, Deutscher acknowledges that Chintai’s lower valuation compared to its peers is largely due to a lack of market awareness. “Why is there that discrepancy despite the fundamentals being just as, if not more strong, for Chintai? Just marketing,” he observed. Mantra has excelled in marketing efforts, attracting considerable attention in the crypto community. “Once Chintai can improve its awareness—and I’m actually giving it more awareness by making this video—that is the only key that it’s missing.” On the technical front, Deutscher finds Chintai’s chart promising. “What I also like from a technical analysis perspective is the fact it’s hovering above this zone, which, if you are technically inclined, you have that technical invalidation,” he said, pointing out the potential for a significant move to previous highs. He remains cautiously optimistic about price targets, emphasizing prudent profit-taking strategies. “I don’t want to get carried away with crazy price targets… I’m never greedy in this market.” Deutscher concludes that Chintai’s combination of regulatory compliance, institutional appeal, and undervalued status makes it a compelling investment. “They can actually attract institutional capital because of the licensing and because of the product they’ve built,” he affirmed. At press time, CHEX traded at $0.2874. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

This breakout has ignited optimism among analysts, who expect further upside in the coming weeks as the US election draws near—a period historically marked by heightened volatility and market shifts. Critical data from CryptoQuant indicates that Open Interest has reached $22.6 billion, with half of these positions held by bears. If Bitcoin continues to climb, this setup creates a high risk of short liquidations, potentially accelerating buying pressure as prices push above $71,000. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst As momentum builds, the next few days will determine whether BTC can sustain its uptrend or if a consolidation phase below the all-time high will continue. Investors are closely watching these price levels, as a confirmed breakout could signal new highs for Bitcoin. At the same time, a stall might suggest a need for additional consolidation before a larger move. Bitcoin Bears In Serious Trouble Bitcoin bears are now at high risk of forced liquidations as a significant level of short position liquidity hovers above the $71,000 threshold. According to top analyst and macro investor Axel Adler, this scenario could ignite a powerful rally if short positions start liquidating en masse. Creating momentum that propels BTC beyond its all-time highs. Adler shared a CryptoQuant chart on X, noting that Bitcoin Open Interest has surged to $22.6 billion, with half of these positions held by bears. In his analysis, Adler emphasizes that the current market structure is poised for a major squeeze. “There’s no need to hesitate in liquidating short positions to drive the price up,” Adler states, suggesting that a cascade of liquidations above $71,000 could act as a launchpad for Bitcoin, taking it into uncharted price discovery levels. This process, known as a “short squeeze,” occurs when overleveraged short holders are forced to close their positions, resulting in large buy orders that send prices even higher. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Holds – Crypto Analyst Sets $202 Target If this scenario unfolds, Bitcoin wouldn’t be the only one benefiting. As BTC leads the market, a rally past previous highs could signal a fresh cycle for the entire crypto space. Altcoins typically follow Bitcoin’s lead, and the spillover effect could fuel a comprehensive bull run, with new highs across multiple assets.  Investors are watching closely, as such a move could renew interest and investment in the crypto market, drawing in retail and institutional capital. With BTC on the edge of price discovery, the next few days may prove pivotal in shaping the market’s direction. BTC Testing Cruial Supply  Bitcoin is testing a supply zone at $71,200, brushing up against the last resistance level before reaching its all-time high. Bulls appear firmly in control, with price action signaling a likely breakout above this level in the coming days. Breaking and holding above the $70,000 mark remains critical. This psychologically significant level reinforces bullish sentiment, encouraging more buyers to enter the market. However, a temporary retracement to gather liquidity at lower demand levels would benefit Bitcoin’s uptrend. A dip toward the $69,000 level, or even down to $66,500, would still align with a bullish outlook. It could attract further interest and create a healthier base for the next rally. These areas would allow Bitcoin to gather liquidity before making a stronger push toward new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High – Smart Money Accumulation?

Following a significant recovery, Bitcoin is once again climbing, with the pivotal $73,811 mark in sight. This renewed upward movement signals a potential breakout, raising the question: could Bitcoin be on the verge of a historic rally? With key indicators turning positive and confidence building in the market, BTC’s journey toward its record high could pave the way for a new chapter in its remarkable ascent. Specifically, this article aims to explore Bitcoin’s recent upbeat momentum and its implications for reaching new heights. Furthermore, by analyzing key technical indicators, market sentiment, and resistance levels, this article seeks to provide readers with insights into Bitcoin’s potential path to its all-time high, evaluating whether a breakout past $73,811 is on the horizon. The Road To Recovery: Bitcoin’s Recent Bullish Momentum After a recent recovery at $65,082, BTC’s price on the 4-hour chart has steadily gained strength, edging closer to its all-time high of $73,811 with an eye on a potential breakout. Trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), BTC shows a strong upward trend that supports the possibility of surpassing this record level. Meanwhile, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals promising potential for continued upward movement, as the RSI has recently surged from the neutral 50% mark to 77%. Typically, the RSI’s movement toward the 77% level is seen as a strong bullish indicator, suggesting that buyers remain in control, potentially paving the way for further upward price action. If this trend persists, it could indicate that BTC’s rally is well-supported by investor confidence and positive sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rallies Above $70K: Is a New High Within Reach? Also, on the daily chart, Bitcoin has demonstrated solid upward movement, highlighted by several bullish candlesticks after a successful rebound from the $65,082 level. This recovery has kept BTC trading above the 100-day SMA, underscoring sustained buying strength and a positive trend continuation. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed examination of the RSI formation indicates renewed upbeat strength for Bitcoin as the indicator’s signal line has risen again to 68% after dropping to  55%, suggesting a sustained optimistic outlook. A rise to the 68% level usually signifies that BTC is experiencing increased buying pressure, as traders are becoming more hopeful about its future price performance. What A Breakout Above $73,811 Could Mean For Bitcoin A breakout above the $73,811 resistance level could mark a crucial turning point for Bitcoin’s future. Clearing this key threshold would not only strengthen bullish sentiment among investors but is also likely to spark a new wave of buying activity, driving prices higher in the pursuit of a new all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Through $65,000, Is “Uptober” Rally Just Getting Started? Nonetheless, if BTC fails to break above the $73,811 level, it may start to decline again towards the $65,082 support level. Should this support level be breached, it could lead to additional downward momentum, potentially pushing the price toward $60,152 and other lower ranges.

Taking this into consideration, a crypto analyst has unveiled a new technical pattern in the Dogecoin price chart called the ”Descending Megaphone.” The analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin can break out of this distinct pattern, it could set the stage for a significant rally to higher price targets. Dogecoin Price Eyes $1 Breakout Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that the Dogecoin daily candle has just closed with a breakout into a “Descending Megaphone pattern.” While this unique technical pattern is a sign of increasing volatility especially during a downtrend, a break above the upper boundary of this chat pattern could indicate a potential upward move.  Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent In the case of Dogecoin, if its price can move beyond the upper line of the Descending Megaphone pattern, it could signal the start of a huge rally. For more clarity, a Descending Megaphone is a bullish chart pattern formed by two diverging trend lines, with the upper line representing the resistance and the lower indicating support. The pattern typically looks like a megaphone with a downward tilt.  According to Trader Tardigrade, despite entering this unique chart pattern, the Dogecoin price has been showing signs of strength and momentum on the daily chart. Looking at the meme coin’s daily chart, the analyst has set a price target of $0.2, predicting that Dogecoin could rise to this level as part of its price action within the Descending Megaphone pattern.  Trader Tardigrade has shared that he is closely observing how the Dogecoin price behaves within this new pattern formation, paying particular attention to any movement towards the upper boundary of the Descending megaphone.  Responding to his bullish predictions, a crypto community member remarked that a $1 price target remains a highly anticipated dream for Dogecoin Trader Tardigrade replied, asserting that this ambitious and coveted price target is no longer a dream for Dogecoin. Bitcoin Price Discovery To Influence DOGE Rally Following his price forecast for Dogecoin, another community member suggested that the Dogecoin price may not reach the $1 target set by Trader Tardigrade without Bitcoin undergoing a price discovery.

Cardano (ADA) is also at a critical juncture, showing striking similarities to its price action in 2020—a year that saw ADA skyrocket by over 4,000% in under 12 months.  Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis comparing ADA’s current market structure to November 2020. According to Martinez, ADA’s recent consolidation around key levels could set the stage for a significant upward surge, particularly following the upcoming U.S. election. Martinez’s analysis highlights Cardano’s pattern of explosive growth after periods of accumulation and points to the potential for a strong rally if Bitcoin breaks new highs. Investors are now closely watching ADA’s price movement, eager to see if it can replicate its historic bull run. As the market prepares for a possible shift, Cardano’s performance in the coming weeks could offer insight into broader altcoin momentum in this cycle. The next moves could be decisive, making ADA one to watch in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Cardano Following 2020 Bullish Pattern  Cardano has captured the attention of analysts and investors who see its current consolidation as a possible signal of accumulation, hinting at a strong move up ahead. Well-known analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, comparing Cardano’s current price behavior and its pattern in 2020—a year in which ADA experienced an extraordinary 4,000% surge.  According to Martinez, Cardano’s price action is displaying a similar setup, suggesting the possibility of a breakout around November 18, roughly two weeks after the U.S. elections. This timeline aligns with historical patterns, where ADA consolidates before explosive upward moves. Martinez’s analysis points to a long-term bullish target of $6.30, representing a potential 2,000% increase from current levels. He anticipates that if it materializes, this rally could lead to a market top for Cardano around September 2025. This prediction is based on ADA’s cyclical price trends, where significant rallies have historically followed periods of low volatility and accumulation, driven by market sentiment and broader crypto adoption. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details Many investors are now watching ADA closely, as such a rally would not only be significant for Cardano but could signal a broader bullish momentum across altcoins.

If history repeats, Cardano could be primed for one of its most powerful surges, attracting new interest and capital into the ecosystem. ADA Technical Levels  Cardano is trading at $0.346 after experiencing a clear rejection from the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.351. This key level has been pivotal, as a break above it and holding it as support would signal a potential shift toward a short-term uptrend. For bulls aiming to regain control over ADA’s price action, establishing a firm foothold above the 200 EMA is essential, as it would likely attract buying interest and strengthen upward momentum. Additionally, the $0.37 supply zone presents another significant hurdle for ADA, as bulls have struggled to reclaim this level since early October. This resistance zone has repeatedly capped price action, indicating that substantial buying pressure is necessary to break through and sustain gains beyond this mark. A bullish trend could gain traction if ADA breaches the 200 EMA and the $0.37 supply zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Positions Face Serious Risk Above $68,500 – Details However, if these levels remain unclaimed, ADA’s price is likely to continue consolidating sideways in the near term. Such a pattern would allow the market to stabilize and potentially attract fresh demand before attempting another breakout, though it may delay any significant upward movement for ADA.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained",2024-10-29 16:30:50+00:00,"The Bitcoin price has surged past the $71,000 mark today. Over the past five days, Bitcoin’s price has rallied by more than 8.5%, climbing from $65,600 to as high as $71,118 on October 29. In the last 24 hours alone, the BTC price has increased by 3.8%. This upward momentum can be attributed to four key factors: #1 Bitcoin ETFs Attract Massive Inflows The surge in Bitcoin’s price is closely linked to substantial inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday witnessed massive ETF flows totaling $479.4 million. BlackRock led the inflows with $315.2 million, followed by Fidelity at $44.1 million, Ark with $59.8 million, and Bitwise at $38.7 million. These significant investments coincided with Bitcoin’s price movement from $68,000 to over $71,000. Leading on-chain analyst James “Checkmate” Check highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin ETF inflows and CME Open Interest. He noted “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher, CME Open Interest is up, but not as much GBTC outflows are also minimal. We’re seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades.” The divergence suggests that investors are favoring direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs rather than engaging in cash and carry trades involving futures contracts. The carry trade strategy in the context of US spot Bitcoin ETFs and CME futures involves buying the ETF (tracking the spot price of Bitcoin) and simultaneously shorting Bitcoin futures on the CME. This approach aims to capitalize on price differences when futures trade at a premium to the spot price (contango). The notable shift toward ETFs indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, anticipating further price appreciation. #2 The “Trump Trade” Political developments are also influencing Bitcoin’s recent rally. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the impact of former President Donald Trump’s interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has gained over 32 million views and driven his Polymarket odds above 66%. Despite “crypto” being touted as the “Trump Trade,” Bitcoin’s correlation with Trump’s potential election victory seems to fuel the Bitcoin price rally. QCP Capital also noted that Bitcoin is up only 8% this “Uptober,” compared to an average of 21% in previous Octobers. They stated, “If spot holds at these levels, this October would mark Bitcoin’s fourth-worst performance in the past decade.” With total BTC perpetual futures open interest across exchanges standing at $27 billion—approaching this year’s peak—a breakout above $70,000 could trigger new all-time highs, especially with more leveraged longs joining in. #3 Shorts Squeeze Amplifies Price Surge Market data indicates a significant shorts squeeze contributing to Bitcoin’s price spike. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 65,622 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations across the entire crypto market amounting to $228.51 million. Of this, $169.47 million were short liquidations. Specifically for Bitcoin, $83.61 million in shorts were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, valued at $18 million. The substantial liquidation of short positions suggests that many traders were betting on a price decline and were forced to close their positions as the market moved against them. This mass unwinding of shorts can accelerate upward price movements as traders buy back into the market to cover their positions. #4 Whales Increase Buying Activity Large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales,” are playing a pivotal role in the current rally. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet observed that Bitcoin’s rally continues, led by activity on the Binance exchange. He pointed out that Binance whales began significant involvement in the market two weeks ago during Asian trading hours, and recent declines in the Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) alongside price increases are “a clear sign of Binance whales’ intervention. Mignolet emphasized that this should not be interpreted as a decline in US demand, but an even stronger buying pressure from Binance. Over the past two weeks, demand for US Bitcoin spot ETFs has surged, with a net inflow of approximately 47,000 Bitcoin. Since most ETF products use Coinbase, movements in CPG data are closely tied to ETF demand. He concluded, “The current Bitcoin price is being driven by Binance whales, with sustained inflows of US capital.” At press time, BTC traded at $71,340.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect",2024-10-29 15:00:10+00:00,"Crypto analyst Random Crypto Pal has predicted that the XRP price is finally ready for a breakout, just as on-chain metrics turn bullish. With a breakout on the horizon, the analyst also provided insights into price targets that XRP could hit as it moves to the upside.  XRP Price Ready For A Breakout Random Crypto Pal predicted in X post that the XRP price was ready for a breakout while sharing a picture of the XRP monthly chart. He remarked that an “explosion is coming,” indicating that the price rally will be parabolic. The analyst made this claim while noting that XRP has recorded a perfect retest of both trend lines.  Related Reading: ‘Bird Beak Sign’ Appears On Bitcoin Price Heikin Ashi Chart, Analyst Explain What This Means The accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could rise to as high as its current ATH of $3.84 when it records this price breakout. XRP has consolidated for about seven years since 2018, when it reached its current ATH. Since then, the XRP community has eagerly anticipated a price breakout, which never came in the 2021 bull run.  However, this time looks different, considering that XRP has finally gained legal clarity and a non-security status in the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, on-chain metrics have turned bullish and support an XRP price breakout. The active addresses on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) have hit a six-month high, indicating renewed interest in the coin among crypto investors. New investors are also flocking into the XRP ecosystem, as new addresses on the network have surged by over 10%.  Daily transactions on the network are also on the rise, which shows that investors are actively trading using XRP. Therefore, these bullish on-chain metrics could also contribute to the XRP rally, which Random Crypto Pal predicts is on the horizon.  Price Could Reach Triple Digits Crypto analyst Javon Marks has again reaffirmed that the XRP price could reach triple digits when this price breakout finally occurs. In an X post, the analyst alluded to the historical price gains that XRP recorded in the 2017 bull run to prove why the coin could reach $200.  Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent His accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could enjoy a price breakout by year-end and a massive rally that will last until year-end 2025, around when the crypto will hit $200. Interestingly, crypto analyst Dark Defender also echoed a similar sentiment when he revealed in an X post that the XRP bull run will last from November 2024 to November 2025.  Meanwhile, Javon Marks noted the similarities between the current XRP price action and that of 2017 are “major.” He remarked that this time around is larger, which means that the result of the price breakout could be greater than the one witnessed in the 2017 bull run.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Triggers Golden Cross: What This Means For The Crypto Trend,2024-10-29 14:05:59+00:00,"Bitcoin price is now above $70,000 per coin. The recent rally back toward local all-time highs has carried BTCUSD high enough to causes two important moving averages to form a “Golden Cross.” This signal has appeared twice since the bear market bottom and yielded significant results. Let’s take a look at the data and the most recent signal now that it has confirmed.   Bitcoin Daily Golden Cross: 50-Day And 200-Day Moving Averages As pictured above, BTCUSD has triggered a daily golden cross of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. In technical analysis, a golden cross happens when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. This typically suggests that there is an actively trending environment and price is expected to appreciate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash ‘Buy’ Signal: Analysts See New Highs On The Horizon The opposite, bearish signal is referred to as a death cross. The chart above also depicts a death cross in August 2024. However, its appearance didn’t lead to a prolonged downtrend. Could this also mean that this latest golden cross might not produce a sustainable uptrend? BTCUSD Golden Cross And Death Cross Recent History Zooming out provides a more clear picture of the signal’s effectiveness since the bear market bottom in November 2022. BTCUSD rising from bear market lows around $16,000 to $23,000 was enough to pull the 50-day moving average above the 200-day average, triggering the first golden cross of 2023. This kept Bitcoin trending higher until it reached roughly $32,000, then fell to retest lows around $25,000. The bearish short-term price action then triggered a death cross. Here, much like we saw in 2024, Bitcoin trended sideways and avoided a downtrend. It didn’t take much upside to force another golden cross. From that golden cross, BTCUSD rallied another 100%, doubling in price. The chart above shows that the golden cross in October 2024 occurred just months after the death cross, just like it did in late 2024. Could that mean another 100% rally from current levels? If so, Bitcoin price could reach as high as $140,000 before beginning to show weakness. Buy And Hold: Using Moving Average Crosses As A Trading System Using the 50-day and 200-day moving averages as a buy and hold trading system starting from 2018 would have yielded significant results. The first golden cross fired in April 2019 at around $5,000 per BTC. A death cross in October 2019 closed out the trade and sold some coins. A quick golden cross and death cross combo in early 2020 led to a small loss. May 2020’s golden cross more than made up for it, triggering when Bitcoin was trading just below $10,000. The trade stayed open while Bitcoin blasted off into its most bullish trend in recent years and eventually closed with the next death cross in Jun 2021 at around $35,000 per BTC. This kept $25,000 in profit from the trade, combined with the initial $4,000 profit from the early 2019 trade to make $29,000. The small loss takes the total closer to $28,500. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates $3.4 Billion October Crypto Inflows—What’s Behind the Boom? In September 2021, BTCUSD golden crossed again at around $45,000, only to shortly later death cross at $3,000 lower. This death cross stayed active until Bitcoin shed another $30,000. Fortunately, using the two moving averages as a buy and hold trading system meant the death cross moved you to cash – avoiding the worst of the bear market. Come early 2023, Bitcoin was ready to begin a new uptrend and the golden cross triggered at $23,000. A death cross formed at $27,000, keeping another $6,000 worth of profits. Another golden cross in October 2023 triggered at $35,000, riding all the way to $62,000 when the most recent death cross closed out the trade. In six trades total, the 50/200MA trading system would have earned approximately $58,500 as Bitcoin traveled from around $5,000 to $74,000. Four out of the six trades were profitable and the two losses were relatively minor when compared to the profits generated. Tony Severino, CMT is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

I'd let u know that i already adjusted the fees and tips ( priority fee 0.005 , bribe 0.001 slippage 15% ) , anways the price quickly hits my take profit and even keeps going higher but when i checked my funds .. instead of being up 0.075 i was down 0.025.

My question is - how is that being handled? Let's say there's a dApp that consists of a frontend + backend apps that enable the user to perform swaps. So the user is presented with a transaction to sign which would then get sent to the blockchain - how in this scenario the developer should make user trust this signed tx won't empty their wallet? Does Phantom provide a way to simulate a given tx so the user can verify what the actual outcome of the tx will be? ",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,solana,How am I actually supposed to perform token swaps??? PLEASE HELP,2024-10-29 21:09:09,"I've been trying to write code that allows me to perform a simple swap over raydium between 2 tokens, after many attempts I only have 1 successful transaction that took ages to finally send.

  
I tried the following code to perform swaps on raydium: [https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-sdk-V2-demo/blob/master/src/api/swap.ts](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-sdk-V2-demo/blob/master/src/api/swap.ts)

However often it returns the error: `TransactionExpiredBlockheightExceededError`. After forcing it to retry a few times I get a successful transaction which takes about 10 minutes overall.

My current setup is to use the high fee and multiply it by 1.5 to get an even higher fee. I am swapping 0.001 SOL for RAY and slippage is 1%.

  
I also tried jupiter but keep getting the same problem TransactionExpiredTimeoutError....

  
Am I going crazy? can someone please direct me to some simple code that can let me make simple swift token swaps. I don't wanna wait like 20 mins retrying my code just for a normal transaction to go through.... Thanks",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,solana,Zerion Wallet SWAP Redirected My Funds to an Unknown Address – Security Flaw or Scam?,2024-10-29 14:46:42,"I’m posting this because **Zerion** wallet just cost me funds in what looks like either a major UI failure or worse: an intentional setup to siphon funds. After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.

* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse. 

* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.

Reddit,solana,"[GUIDE] Shitcoin Trading: The High-Risk Strategy That Can Turn $50 Into $50,000",2024-10-28 10:12:28,"## (Warning: Most Traders Get Rekt)

Sup degens, how was the weekend? Your favorite degen philosopher is back with a new guide! 

  

Today we're diving into something that most traditional traders won't touch with a ten-foot pole - a systematic approach to trading shitcoins. 

  

But first, a reality check: this isn't financial advice! What you're about to read is closer to professional gambling than investing. 

  

If you're looking for a safe way to grow your wealth, stick to Bitcoin, ETH, stocks, or real estate.

### The Three-Step Strategy

Think of this like a video game where you're leveling up. Each step has its own risk level, required capital, and potential rewards. The key is starting small and only moving up when you've mastered the current level.

### Level 1: Micro Cap Warfare

This is where the wildest gains and fastest losses happen. We're talking about tokens so fresh you can smell the code being deployed.

  

Trade size: $5-$50. If that sounds too small, you're already thinking about this wrong.

  

Before you even think about trading, set your goals. Let's say you're starting with $50. Your target should be to grow it to $500 through a series of smaller trades. Not through one moonshot - that's called gambling. Having a clear target helps you make rational decisions instead of getting caught up in the ""what if it goes higher"" mentality.

  

Here's what you're looking for:

  

- Liquidity under $100k 
- At least 400 transactions per hour (can be lower, but the higher, the better) 
- Fresh pairs (minutes or hours old) 
- Target: 10x-100x gains 
  

Let me paint you a picture of how this typically plays out: You spot a fresh token launch with growing volume. You ape in $20 worth of SOL, setting up your grid sells immediately. Within an hour, the price pumps 5x. Your first grid sell triggers, taking profit on 25% of your position. Another thirty minutes pass - it hits 10x. Your second grid sell executes.

  

Then it happens - the price starts dropping fast. Manual traders are frantically watching the charts, emotions running high. 

  

""It'll bounce back,"" they tell themselves, watching their profits evaporate. But you? Your trailing stop loss kicks in automatically, securing your gains at 7x instead of the full 10x. Sure, you didn't hit your higher grid sells, but you walked away with real profit instead of hopium.

  

This is why automation is crucial at this level. The moves are too fast for human reaction time and too emotional for human decision making.

### Level 2: Medium Cap Mastery

Once you've grown your initial stack, it's time to play with slightly bigger fish. Your goal here should be specific - say, turning that $500 into $2,500 through a series of calculated plays.

  

Trade size: $50-$200

  

Here's what separates these plays from Level 1:

  

- Liquidity between $100k-$1M 
- 1000+ daily transactions 
- Pairs at least 2 weeks old 
- Target: 3x-10x gains 
  

Let's look at a typical Level 2 play: You find a token that's been trading for three weeks, showing steady growth in holders and volume. You enter with $100 when you notice whale accumulation patterns. Your grid sells are set at 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 5x.

  

Unlike Level 1, you might hold this for a day or two, but not much longer. Remember - these are still shitcoins, not investments. When volume spikes, your first grid sell hits at 1.5x. By evening, you've taken profits at 2x. The remaining position rides with your trailing stop, exiting at 2.5x when momentum slows twelve hours later. Clean, emotionless, profitable.

### Level 3: Large Cap Legends

Welcome to the big leagues. Your goal here should be turning that $2,500 into $10,000+ through steady, calculated moves.

  

Trade size: $200-$1000+

  

Your targets have evolved:

  

- Liquidity over $1M 
- Strong daily transaction count 
- Established pairs (1+ months) 
- Target: 2x-3x gains 
  

Here's what a Level 3 play looks like: You've identified a token with solid momentum and strong volume. You enter with $500 after careful analysis. While you might hold this position for a week or two, you're not investing here - you're trading with a clear exit strategy.

  

Your grid sells are conservative: 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x, 2.5x. The beauty of automation here is that you don't need to babysit your position. Set your grid sells, set your trailing stop, and let the system work. Maybe it takes three days to hit your targets, maybe it takes two weeks. Either way, your automated system ensures you stick to your plan instead of getting caught up in market emotions.

### The Reality Check

This game is incredibly risky and highly addictive. Your dopamine receptors will light up like a Christmas tree with every successful trade. You'll feel invincible after a few wins. That's exactly when the market usually teaches its most expensive lessons.

  

Success in this space requires iron discipline. Most traders can't handle it. They start with smart risk management, hit a few wins, get overconfident, and lose everything on one bad play. 

  

Don't be that trader.

  

The key to success in this game is having clear, achievable goals for each level. Don't just throw money at tokens hoping for the best. Before entering any trade, know exactly what profit you're targeting and what loss you're willing to accept. Without specific goals, you're just gambling. With them, you're executing a strategy. Is it still incredibly risky? Absolutely. But at least you're giving yourself a fighting chance.

  

The market doesn't care about your profit targets. It doesn't care about your hopes or dreams. It will happily take your money if you let it. Your only defense is strict risk management and the ability to walk away when things aren't going your way.

### The Bottom Line

This strategy can work, but it requires more discipline than most traders possess. If you decide to play this game, start small, use strict risk management, and never forget that you're essentially playing high-stakes poker with anonymous degens on the internet. 

  

Stay frosty, and may your stops hit before the rugs pull.

  

P.S. As always, if you're not using automated trading tools for this, you're bringing a knife to a gunfight.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,solana,What are you using to Day-Trade tokens and minimise fees?,2024-10-29 01:31:13,"Hey,

I'm currently day trading pumpfun tokens and seeing some decent profits. Spent a few weeks testing some strategies and so far it's positive. I started with 1 SOL and now I'm at around 6 the platform fees are getting larger per transaction. I've searched but can't find a way around this, so I'm keen to understand what others are doing.

At the moment I'm tracking my trades on GMGN, then executing the buy and sell on Trojan. While the TP and SL are handy, it's not a must for me. I was trading directly through GMGN but they're 1% or each trade and TROJ is 0.9%.

On a 5SOL trade (buy and sell) I'm shelling out about $NZD30, which the gas + tip is less than 5% of the total fees paid. 

Is there any way to get around paying the 1% or 0.9% on these bots and just ""trade directly"" for example. Hope this makes sense and yes I realise this could be a very stupid question.

  
Thx",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

I have generated the private key for a solana vanity wallet address on a currently offline computer, and would like to add it to a hardware wallet then delete all traces of the key on my computer, then use the hardware wallet to sign phantom transactions. Is there a wallet that allows me to import the private key onto it to do this? Or is my only option for a vanity address to import the key into phantom and hope for the best? I realise the mere existence of it at some point on my computer doesnt allow for 100% security but i hope it may be enough.

Then greed kicks in & I watch all these X traders on Solana trading MEMES.

I follow a bunch of& join all the telegram's they have with signals & calls.

then one of the groups is called ""Tates War Room"" pops up, I click & join & they say they are announcing a new token.

107k follower, I dont check. Im like cool.. I pull out 50% of my portfolio & ape into the coin once they announce it.

5 mins into the first candle sticks its going parabolic then I begin seeing red so I order to sell.

I cant.. the token is worth 0.

there is 14$ liquidity in the pool by 5 mins, Started out 17k first min or 2.

im trapped with a 7.7M $MOGA, worth 0. I aped in with 1k+.

Keep in mind the first min, I see my wallet balance reach multimillions so I spam to sell & im feeling euphoric but there is NO LIQUIDITY.

Then they casually start deleting the telegram chat then the entire group....

I send the DM to the contact for inquiry on the group he makes up some shit about it not going as planned & he will make it up by sending me a VIP invite to the next launch OCT 31st, which is 3 mins before the launch...

  
I am not feeling sane after this experience & would advise all newbies like me to be careful.. wish me sanity & not to ape any more $.

If you have *helpful information that is legitimate*, post your information here where *everyone else can see it*, rather than trying to be a sneaky scammer sending me links in DMs that you don't want everyone else here to see to not out *yourself* as a scammer.

Hey folks, 
I'm curious, say I exchange SOL for some ridiculous meme coin connecting my Exodus wallet to Jupiter through the Web3 services, through Exodus' web3 connection ability.

Will that token I exchange the SOL for be in a wallet that will remain connected to Exodus or in a saved session through its web3 connection to Jupiter, or that I'll retain access to once I end/close the web3 session?

I'm a little weary about making the exchanges, thinking as soon as I close that web3 session, my access to the wallet containing the memecoin exchanged through Exodus' web3 connection to Jupiter.

Anyone have any information to help ease my concerns? I've never really messed with web3 connections to other services at all, let alone through Exodus.

(And yes, I know meme coins are silly and risky, but I'm bored and want to have some fun gambling, and try my luck at getting in on a newly created memecoin [with adequate liquidity, and no freezing or minting enabled) and catch that pump and then sell before the inevitable dump.] Just want to make it known I'm aware of the risks of such memecoins before anyone wants to lecture me on it :) )

Thanks in advance folks!

So let’s assume I have all the infra in place to perform extremely fast txs. I hook it up with one of the good wallets and start copying. The problem is the moment this wallet buys it pushes the token price up. The moment it sells - it makes the token price go down. So no matter how fast are your txs, even if you somehow end up landing your tx in the same block as the wallet you’re watching you’re still buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price than the wallet in question. 

So if this wallet is marking, say, 30% on each of those trades - you’ll be making inherently less. If that’s the case then what’s the point of copy trading in general? Am I missing anything?

Reddit,ethereum,How does Vitalik stay safe?,2024-10-29 11:11:24,"A few weeks ago, I watched ""Vitalik: An Ethereum Story,"" and although I knew that Vitalik travels a lot, I was surprised by its scale. One day, he's in Denver; the other day, he's in Bogota, and he even traveled to warzone Ukraine. 

While watching, my friend asked me: “How does he stay safe? Aren’t there anti-crypto people who might want to harm him or some criminals wanting to kidnap him since he’s so rich?”.

And tbh I had no answer to that.

Vitalik does hundreds of talks, with tens of thousands of people watching them. Most people are nice and friendly, but it only takes one crazy person with a knife to do a bad thing. I was at his two talks (at Devconnect ‘23 and Dappcon 24) and never saw any security person there, nor did I see a trace of any personal bodyguard.

Also, he travels to less safe countries where even normal people might have problems, let alone famous billionaires.

Reddit,ethereum,Zerion Wallet SWAP Redirected My Funds to an Unknown Address – Intentional Scam or Security Flaw?,2024-10-29 14:52:09,"I’m posting this because **Zerion** wallet just cost me funds in what looks like either a major UI failure or worse: an intentional setup to siphon funds. After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.
* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse.
* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

I made an ETH transfer to my Trezor, but I made a mistake by choosing the BEP-20 (BSC) network, which is not supported by Trezor. The transfer should have been made via the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.

To try to recover the funds, I set up a wallet in MetaMask connected to the BNB Chain. In BscScan, the transaction appears as confirmed, and the balance is correct and at the address.

I then transferred BNB to the same address to cover the transaction fees. I also added the BNB Chain network to MetaMask and imported the Binance-Peg ETH token using the contract

Reddit,ethereum,Liberation from the taboo on price discussions,2024-10-29 06:07:30,"The Ethereum community still seems to ignore or taboo discussions on price.

Even after the transition to POS, the equation of 'price = security' has been established for Ethereum.

In the debate with Bitcoin maximalists, the Ethereum community, including Vitalik, argued that the burning mechanism is better for increasing value than the fixed issuance amount.

This is also why Justin Drake's 'Ultra Sound Money' meme was born.

I think we need to discuss more seriously how to gradually increase the price of Ethereum. This is not just about making money. The goal is to make Ethereum the network with the strongest security and censorship resistance.

What Bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity. The belief in the immutable issuance rules. In the case of Ethereum, the policy on the total issuance amount seems too vague. I think this is Ethereum's worst selling point.

I thought about several monetary policies.

1. Increase the burn fee when the target total issuance exceeds 100 million, and reduce the burn fee when it falls below, maintaining 100 million.

2. Burn all fees including MEV to create endless deflation. When the total issuance decreases to 50 million, split the coin in half. Then, the number of Ethers will be 50 million -> 100 million -> 50 million -> 100 million repeatedly. People get excited when companies like Tesla and Nvidia do Stocksplit.

3. Set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,ethereum,"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared Vision",2024-10-26 11:41:15,"I’ve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. On the surface, they may seem like separate communities—one focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology—but at their core, they’re both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society.

Both UBI and Ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. They’re about creating a world where we don’t have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we’re looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. It’s about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society.

Money, when you think about it, is political. Every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. In a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper—into the structures that uphold our shared reality.

For those interested in diving further into this vision, here’s a bit of inspiration from popular culture:

- **Arrival** – A film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens.
- **Outlander** – A story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today.
- **Mad Men** – A look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception.
- **Devs** – A glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself.

These themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. Basic Income and Ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future.

And how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn?


please help, I can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are L2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues.



---




Edit: It finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/DepartedQuantity for helping me out.


So here's my understanding:

Till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the L1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the L1 as a single transaction with some proofs. And some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. 


But the thing is that the L2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. Connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. And all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network    are transactions details(or whatever) in L2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered.


And not L1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,ethereum, Ethereum builder centralization and your contribution,2024-10-18 22:13:25,"In recent weeks, more than 90% of Ethereum blocks have been built by just two block builders: beaverbuild.org and titanbuilder.xyz. This trend is growing, and it’s likely these two will dominate nearly all block production soon, profiting massively from users transactions MEV. [https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d](https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d)

The driving force behind this centralization is XOF (private orderflow), as explained by Toni Wahrstätter on X: [https://x.com/nero\_eth/status/1846786871998759141](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1846786871998759141)

So, where does this private orderflow originate?

For [titanbuilder.xyz](http://titanbuilder.xyz), it partly comes from BananaGunBot (https://x.com/BananaGunBot), as seen in blocks like this one: [https://etherscan.io/block/20959121](https://etherscan.io/block/20959121)

For [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org), it comes from platforms like [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (https://cow.fi/mev-blocker). Their FAQ states they submit to all major builders:

>MEV Blocker submits to all major block builders, including Builder0x69, f1b, Flashbots, rsync builder, Titan Builder, Gambit Labs, and Beaver Build.

But there is a catch: who created MEV Blocker? according to their FAQ:

>MEV Blocker is jointly formulated and maintained by CoW Protocol, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is open to all searchers and block builders.

The last part seems questionable. With control over the order flow, who would rationally share most profitable or important transactions with competitors?

It gets worse: a bot operated by beaverbuild uses the same calldata as the notorious jaredfromsubway MEV bot (https://x.com/MevRefund/status/1835666845547815067), suggesting beaverbuild likely operates the jared bot. jaredfromsubway is known for sandwiching pretty much everything and everyone (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f2f10d1c40777ae1da742455c65828ff36df387).

So, what’s my point? Avoid trading shitcoins, especially with BananaGun. And don’t use [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (rather make sure you have set your slippage tolerance correctly), which appears to be little more than a hypocritical frontend for beaverbuild.

Reddit,ethereum,Lido's Simple DVT Module Surpasses Expectations—A Deeper Look at Distributed Validator Technology's Future in Ethereum Staking,2024-10-18 11:50:36,"I’ve been keeping an eye on the recent developments with Lido’s Simple DVT module, and the numbers are impressive. Just recently, the module hit 2,250 validators and over 72,000 ETH staked, surpassing its initial 0.5% share limit, as noted by u/LidoFinance. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) now powers around 0.75% of the entire Lido protocol. What’s even more interesting is how these DVT clusters are outperforming 8 out of the top 10 staking entities, according to u/ratedw3b.

This got me thinking: What does this mean for the future of Ethereum staking? 🤔

For one, the decentralization of staking is clearly on the rise. DVT allows for a more robust and fault-tolerant staking infrastructure, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure. Projects like SSV Network and Obol Collective are really pushing the envelope here, making Ethereum staking more accessible and secure for both solo and community stakers. It’s awesome to see over 140 new solo and community stakers becoming node operators via DVT—this is a huge step toward decentralization.

But it also raises a bigger question: Could DVT be the key to breaking the dominance of large staking pools and making Ethereum more decentralized at the protocol level? 🤔

SSV Network, in particular, has been at the forefront of this movement. By enabling secure and distributed validator setups, they are changing the game for both small-scale stakers and large operators. I can’t help but wonder how this will impact the wider Ethereum ecosystem, especially as staking becomes more fragmented and democratized.

Would love to hear what you all think—are we on the verge of a decentralization revolution in Ethereum staking, or is it too early to tell? ",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,ethereum,Domain Registrar Based on Smart Contracts,2024-10-17 17:05:22,"# Project Concept

We propose creating a new type of domain registrar that uses smart contracts instead of traditional accounts to determine domain management rights.

# How It Works

1. When transferring a domain to this registrar, functions in the smart contract are called to add the new domain.
2. The address of the smart contract that has the rights to sign changes related to this domain is specified.

# Advantages

1. **Decentralized Management:** Domains do not depend on an individual's email.
2. **Flexible Management:** Ability to use multi-signature or DAO voting for decisions on DNS record changes.
3. **Security:** Use of cryptographic protection methods instead of passwords.
4. **Transparency:** All changes are recorded on the blockchain.

# Technical Implementation

1. **Integration with Existing DNS:** The service functions as a regular centralized registrar, fully compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure.
2. **Support for Popular Domains:** Ability to transfer and manage top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.).
3. **Auto-Renewal:** The system automatically renews domain registration by deducting funds from the smart contract.
4. **Open Balance Top-Up:** Any user can top up the contract balance for a specific domain without the need for authorization.

# Potential Applications

* For DAO projects
* For collaborative business projects
* For personal use (using a wallet instead of email for ownership confirmation)

# Questions for the Community

1. If such a project were implemented and announced by one of the top 10 existing domain registrars, would you use it for your new project?
2. Would you consider using this service for your personal domains?
3. What additional features would you like to see in such a service?
4. How do you assess the potential of this technology for managing digital assets in the future?",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Finaly unstaking was enabled in March 2023, when everyone who had staked on the PoS chain could unstake if they wish so.

Help scale Rocket Pool and support decentralized node operators!,2024-10-16 00:53:10,"Hi r/ethereum, I’m one of the co-founders of NodeSet, the developer of [Constellation](https://nodeset.medium.com/project-hyperdrive-4819f22391dc), a “Layer 2” staking protocol built on top of Rocket Pool! 

The main innovations of Constellation are xrETH, a liquid ETH staking token with ZERO fees on Ethereum staking rewards (including MEV), and xRPL, a liquid staking token for RPL. Gravita is launching the first public Constellation deployment on mainnet today, and [minting these tokens is now available via the Gravita website!](https://app.gravitaprotocol.com/constellation/xreth)

Once minted, the Constellation contracts non-custodially distribute the assets among NodeSet’s hundreds of decentralized operators, funding the operator bond (currently 8 ETH + 2.4 ETH or RPL) and unlocking their ability to deploy RP validators at scale.

We’ve spent the last 18+ months building both a robust (250+) and vetted cohort of independent node operators, including solo stakers, Rocket Pool operators, and small staking businesses. NodeSet’s mission is to connect the long-tail of decentralized operators that make Ethereum the most credibly neutral settlement layer in the world to compute opportunities across the ecosystem. Constellation, our first major project, supports the protocol that got us started on our journey as a company, Rocket Pool. Over the last year, RP has faced scaling challenges due to its bonding requirements, which has resulted in contraction of the protocol. Constellation was designed to alleviate those challenges while improving Rocket Pool’s underlying asset distribution. With nearly 40,000 ETH sitting in the rETH deposit pool, it’s time to unleash Constellation and grow Ethereum’s most decentralized liquid staking protocol! 

For those interested in diving deeper into the technology, please [take a look at the Constellation documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation). There’s a lot of work remaining, but we will be adding more information over the coming weeks, and [the GPLv3 code is available on our GitHub](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation), of course. On the security side, we recently [concluded three audits from some of the best in the business](https://github.com/nodeset-org/constellation/tree/main/audits) like Chainsafe and Sigma Prime, and [our bug bounty program details are located in the documentation](https://docs.nodeset.io/constellation/security-information).

Reddit,ethereum,Upsides and Downsides of Lowering Ethereum's Solo Staking Requirement?,2024-10-15 12:29:21,"The current solo staking system is for rich people. Most of us here dont have 32 ETH. Right now 32 ETH is $82 700 - only those with deep pockets can become validators because thats not even life savings for the average person. This of course excludes many average investors from helping secure the network directly

Vitalik posted yesterday in his blog the idea of dropping the staking requirement - He said as low as 1 ETH

Quoting:

>Ideally, we want to preserve economic finality, while simultaneously improving on the status quo in two areas:

>1 Finalize blocks in one slot (ideally, keep or even reduce the current length of 12s), instead of 15 min

>2 Allow validators to stake with 1 ETH (down from 32 ETH)

As someone who wishes to become a validator I think this is good and bad. Making staking accessible to more people would pump participation and decentralization - But is this ideal???

The first downside is the impact on yields - With more validators joining rewards would decrease by a lot - making solo staking less profitable. This would also dilute the incentives for maintaining nodes - which could result in less security if validators lose interest because of the lower returns. On the flip side decentralization would increase with more people participating - not just whales. There would be less reliance on staking pools - Lido for example

More participants means a more resilient network but this is at the cost of validator quality and security

The staking requirement should drop a little so it gives smaller investors a chance - not just the rich - but it should be something higher like 10 ETH. This way the network wouldnt be trading validator rewards for participation and decentralization and security would be maintained and the yields wouldnt be so low",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,ethereum,Help accessing wallet please in Status app on iphone,2024-10-14 16:17:22,"Hi, it's been a long time since I've done this so I'm hoping someone can assist me. My daughter was gifted some ethereum and had it in the Status app on her iphone. She'd previousyl transferred some from there to her coinbase account to sell some when she needed to.

She's now gone in to the Status app and there's bugger all there, like $18 instead of upwards of a few thousand. She has her 12 word seed phrase. I can see that the wallet address still has a sizeable sum in it.

Of course, I don't want to screw this up but what's the process of accessing it again via the Status app, or perhaps another app? I though that we could simply enter the wallet address, followed by the seed phrase and boom, back in again. As i said, it's been quite some time since I've done this so any help would be appreciated.

Many thanks in advance.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241
Reddit,ethereum,Staking,2024-10-14 16:03:07,"I’m new to the thread so please let me know if this is a commonly asked question that I should reference somewhere else.

I have about $10K worth of ETH in Coinbase. I realize that I should be staking it to earn the yield but Coinbase doesn’t offer staking in New York State.

Should I transfer my ETH to a wallet/app that offers staking? Which wallets/apps do you recommend I store and stake my ETH with? I tend to prefer simple tools, as I find many crypto tools complex.

Hello, I needed access to my Coinbase account so I could pull tax documents and filled out the form for someone to contact me because Coinbase don’t have a number listed. Within a minute I was contacted by someone by the name of Ryan Roy stating he was with Coinbase support. It seemed like he had quite a bit of information and nothing seemed out of place so he assisted us over the course of a week to get the issue resolved. He would help us get verified and walked us thru everything and said he needed to get the right computers linked up and that we had to many currently linked which is why we were always getting locked out of our account. He was able to name the computers connected to the account and we needed to make sure each computer was verified. He worked with us for a while for a week. 

Long story short- he stole all our cryptocurrency. 

There were so many red flags and I am so upset for not trusting my gut!!!

Reddit,ethereum,I can't verify contract code deployed on ZKsync with Foundry,2024-10-13 05:20:53,"I have a contract that I deployed on ZKsync. It deployed successfully, but I can't verify the code so I can see it on zksync block explorer:  

Look at this command  

    forge verify-contract \
        --zksync \
        --num-of-optimizations 200 \
        --watch \
        --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode ""constructor(string)"" ""MY_CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETER"") \

        --compiler-version v0.8.19 \
        MY_CONTRACTS_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS \
        src/MY_CONTRACT_NAME.sol:MY_CONTRACT_NAME

This command results in an `Invalid API Key` error. Which is expected because I put `https://zksync2-mainnet-explorer.zksync.io/contract_verification` for `--etherscan-api-key`. The problem is that I can't see a way to login on `https://explorer.zksync.io/` like I can on Etherscan, so I can't get an API key.  

Before you tell me about `https://explorer.zksync.io/contracts/verify?address=MY_CONTRACT_NAME`, this doesn't work for me. I filled out the form exactly correct. I attached my flattened code which I made by running: `forge flatten src/MY_CONTRACT_NAME.sol > MY_CONTRACT_NAMEFlattened.sol` and filled out every other detail correctly including the constructor arguments which I got with `cast abi-encode ""constructor(string)"" ""MY_CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETER""`, but it gives me a `Deployed bytecode is not equal to generated one from given source` error which makes no sense because I filled it out perfectly.  

So can someone show me how to verify the deployed contract via Foundry?",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241
Reddit,ethereum,Can layer 2 scalability really undermine Ethereum’s value?,2024-10-12 08:15:40,"Lately, I’ve been seeing more and more posts, mostly on X, explaining why, in their opinion, it’s now certain that the price of ETH can only go down. 

Their argument is that Ethereum’s scalability, based on L2, leads to a growing reduction in users who rely on L1, and that the fees paid by L2s to L1 are extremely low (almost free), which translates into lower revenues for L1. So if the L2s roadmap plays out, it would basically result in a divergence between Ethereum L1 utility (increasing by number of users on L2s settling on Ethereum) and ETH price (decreasing by lower fees geenrated for L1).

Another argument that’s often heard is that the most successful L2s in the medium/long term will completely detach from Ethereum, becoming independent L1s and taking their user base with them.

Regarding this last argument, I find it unlikely since the value of Ethereum lies precisely in its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance, and that’s not something L2s can easily achieve overnight. So, unless an L2 wants to become a centralized L1 like others, it wouldn’t make sense to detach from Ethereum.

As for the first argument, the issue of fees paid by L2s to settle transactions on L1 is definitely relevant. Currently, they are very low, but that doesn’t mean it can’t change in the future. After all, Ethereum’s main value is to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant layer for settling transactions. Being the only chain with these characteristics, aside from perhaps Bitcoin, Ethereum L1 should charge appropriate fees to L2s for settlement.

What do you think?",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,It’s Not About One Bitcoin – It’s About the Value You Store,2024-10-29 13:26:46,"
I often hear people talk about how they “missed the boat” on Bitcoin, wishing they’d bought sooner or lamenting that they may never own a whole coin. But here’s the thing: if Bitcoin is truly a store of value, it doesn’t actually matter when you bought or how much you own.

Think of it this way: if you do a certain amount of work, and that work has a value X, you’re simply translating X into Bitcoin. Even if you receive fewer satoshis now than you might have in the past, you’re still storing the same amount of value — the X amount of work. This X amount of work, or value, will appreciate at the same rate as any Bitcoin that was stored earlier.

Sure, owning a full Bitcoin is great, but whether you have a whole coin, a fraction, or just a few satoshis, your value appreciates right alongside everyone else’s. It’s about storing value, not hitting an arbitrary number of Bitcoin.

Reddit,bitcoin,The greatest attribute of Bitcoin is that it encourages people to question Fiat. Particularly when Central Banks are paving the way for CBDC's without any political mandate.,2024-10-29 15:11:28,"When I first discovered Bitcoin I was a cynic and didn't mine/ buy any. However I was immediately fixated by it and the debate surrounding it. For the first time in my life I was starting to ask questions of the central bank paper notes and coins I had always known, but never questioned.

Back then this wasn't normal behaviour. One did not question money, one just did what they could to accumulate as much as they could. ""*Have you ever questioned what that note actually means?*"" I'd find myself blurting out in public. Only to be met with looks of ""*what the fuck you on about you fucking nutter*?"". 

At that point, it wasn't so much I'd found Bitcoin, rather I was finding out the bleak reality of the Fiat money I had never thought to question. This wasn't an opt in form of money with finite supply, but a currency I was forced to accept as legal tender with limitless supply. One that had been underpinned by gold under the Bretton Woods system until 1971 when the United States ended the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. 

At school, money often featured in education. How to count it, how it been used throughout history, how it was made... but never what it actually was, what stood for or what gave it value. Today when I zoom out on opinion it isn't Bitcoin isn't actually the most important thing, rather for the first time I history it's the swell of people now starting question the currency governments legally force them to use. 

Without any direct political mandate and without citizens being directly asked iglobal central banks are paving the way to launch central bank digital currencies. Preliminary public consultation on CBDC's is often non-existent or extremely limited. Historically, the way democracy is undermined by governments is by early/ muted announcement with little immediate action, using the passage of time to condition the public into thinking it's already been accepted by society before they gradually take action to phasing it in. This is exactly what's happening with CBDC's today. 

Global central banks do not have a mandate from the people to spend time and resources paving the way for Central Bank Digital Currencies... and yet they continue. These are digital currencies you will legally be forced to use and yet the vast majority of world are excluded from any conversation on them. In what could be one of the biggest changes to Fiat money for centuries citizens of any democratic society should have a voice. The fact they disproportionately don't should be a major red flag.

Bitcoin proponents have the right to optimistic in the same way Bitcoin cynics have the right to be cynical. Open source development, code repositories, public/ decentralised blockchains and ultimately the option to opt in/ out in the free market is about as fair as any form of digital money can get. CBDC's not only won't offer this, currently there's no political mandate central banks should be looking at them at all.

**TLDR**

If nothing else, Bitcoin has society asking tough questions of fiat money for the first time in decades if not centuries. Questions that we never thought to ask, rarely knew or were never taught. It has us questioning the extent of our freedom, the role of central banks and value of legal tender. This is important as (without any direct political mandate) governments and central banks conspire to roll out fiat 2.0 in the form of CBDC's largely without it citizens ever being asked. 




**Federal Reserve**: [we have been exploring the potential benefits and risks of CBDCs from a variety of angles, including through technological research and experimentation. Our key focus is on whether and how a CBDC could improve on an already safe and efficient U.S. domestic payments system.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm)

**European Central Bank**: [We are working with the national central banks of the euro area to look into the possible issuance of a digital euro. It would be a central bank digital currency, an electronic equivalent to cash. And it would complement banknotes and coins, giving people an additional choice about how to pay.](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/html/index.en.html)

Reddit,bitcoin,had a vision last night about Bitcoin,2024-10-29 13:56:59,"Alright, please bear with me, because I know this sounds completely out there. But I had this dream—no, it was more than a dream. It was one of those sleep paralysis things, where you’re awake but you can’t move, and something just takes over you. It was insane, guys. I don’t know if it was a warning or what, but I’m still shaking just thinking about it.

So I’m lying in bed, right? Middle of the night, pitch black, and I wake up, but I can’t move. My body’s frozen, and all I can do is stare at the ceiling. Suddenly, I see this green arrow—I kid you not, a glowing green arrow, just there, hovering in the darkness. And it’s pointing up. It starts small, then it gets bigger, brighter, like this electric green bolt shooting into the sky. And behind it, I see the Bitcoin chart, clear as day, moving up in real time.

No red candles. Just green, like nothing I’ve ever seen before, like Bitcoin was alive. It was soaring past numbers I can’t even comprehend—$500,000, $1 million, and it just kept going. My whole room felt like it was buzzing, like I could feel the energy, vibrating, humming in my ears. I couldn’t breathe; I couldn’t look away.

And I swear, I saw faces in the shadows—people cheering, some people in awe, some people… crying? I know, it sounds insane, but it felt like a glimpse into something coming, something huge. Like I was staring straight at destiny, and it was showing me what’s about to happen. I was paralyzed, just forced to watch as this green line went higher and higher, taking over everything.

When I finally broke free, I was drenched in sweat, heart pounding, just staring into the darkness. I know it sounds like I’m nuts, but guys, I can’t shake this feeling. Something is coming, something massive, and if this was any kind of sign… I’m going all in.

If I’m wrong, I’m wrong, but y’all gotta go with me on this one.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,bitcoin,Safe to Carry a Card Containing my Seed Phrase and the Wallet in an International Flight?,2024-10-29 10:52:48,"As the question says. I have the seed phrase (collection of 24 words like _theatre_, _soldier_ etc.) written on the card supplied by Trezor and the wallet itself. 

As I am relocating, it is necessary to carry them with me. But in the process (with all those high tech airport scanners and cameras), what's the safest feasible way? I am actually more concerned about the card than the wallet itself. 

If I put it with my locked check-in luggage (under protective layers of clothing and other items), as it will go through different cameras at origin and destination, can any of them pick up the words written on the card (with simple ball point pens)? I am not really a security-tech guy, so I may be paranoid? But is there a possibility? 

I am more scared of carrying them (card+wallet) in person as hand luggage, as the security might call for a secondary check. 

Assuming you _have to_ carry both of them in the flight, how would you do it, feasibly, and inconspicuously, without drawing attention? 

I don't currently have a lot of fund in the wallet, but I intent to continue to use it and keep more. So if it is compromised in the transit I may be screwed years down the line. ",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

By comparison, my 401k funds often highlight the S&P 500’s 9% CAGR over the past 40 years. So, while the idea of Bitcoin reaching millions might sound unbelievable, it’s actually a highly plausible scenario.

I once jokingly asked a 9-year-old what he would do when he starts earning money, and his immediate answer was, ""invest"". When I asked what he would invest in, he replied, ""Bitcoin"". His parents have never purchased Bitcoin, so he likely heard of it from friends, internet or TV. Imagine a younger generation growing up with an awareness of Bitcoin and seeing it as a viable path to building generational wealth..

The world’s third most valuable company, Microsoft, is currently voting on whether to invest in Bitcoin. I think it's reasonable to expect that Apple, Amazon, Google, and Meta might follow suit sooner or later.

Reddit,bitcoin,Overbeaten topic: Swaping BTC for crypto makes no sense also because...,2024-10-29 22:44:42,"Besides that your are purely gambling and chances are high that you cry, there is something else you should know.

Yes, there used to be a market manip model that served well in the past but those days are gone! BTC dominance traditionally dilutes into crypto, shits then rise and then back into btc or tether after the Top, and then back to...cash. Probably we'll see this again towards the end of 2025.

Now the change which you might have missed, actually, crushed that same model massively. Reason? The futures! Since we have all those derivatives, most of the whales no longer need those shits. 

This is what you should learn today - 2017 will never happen again, at the same scale at least. You could see it in 2021. We had back then some isolated spikes like the memes but 90% of all the cryptos failed badly. You can see that 4y ago many shits did a lot lesser than the previous 2017 ATH including new fresh projects. Why?

Again, not many Whales find those old techniques anyhow useful anymore. Shits cause a lot more pain, thus the legal risk. Many people, ordinary people suffer. Your shit projects may come under the Judge's hammer, And the celebrities, all tbose Kims And Nicos  , got burned last time. Since lessons have been learnt, thus not many would promote the shits. 

I.e. shits are seen a lot more legally riskier, even unpopular (among the market whales). They are so unprofessional and basically are seen as an obsolete technique to leverage gains.

Nowadays with all those crypto derivatives not many need to pump shits. It will happen in a much more niche way but Bitcoin will continue building dominance robustness while you hold some shitcoins hoping to see 30x...is not haplening dude! Not many would leverage through crypto anymore. We have ample tools much more professional and legal tools to achieve that same result!

Funds were sent to the Bitcoin address derived from hashing this prefix-less public key.

Now, standard Bitcoin wallets and tools cannot reproduce the same address from the private key because they generate public keys with the correct prefix. Consequently, any transaction I attempt to make is rejected by the network with an error stating that the public key is neither compressed nor uncompressed.

Reddit,bitcoin,This is why you must HODL! Softwar,2024-10-29 18:50:31,"
Current analysis of Bitcoin's underlying proof-of-work technology is almost exclusively based on financial, monetary, or economic theory. Recycling the same theoretical frameworks when performing hypothesis-deductive analysis of Bitcoin has the potential to create systemic-level analytical bias which could negatively impact public policy making efforts and could even pose a threat to US national security. This thesis introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the potential national strategic impact of Bitcoin as an electro-cyber security technology rather than a pee-to-peer cash system. The goal of this thesis is to give the research community a different frame of reference they can utilize to generate hypotheses and deductively analyze the potential risks and rewards of proof-of-work technologies as something other than strictly monetary technology. The author asserts it would be beneficial for researchers to explore alternative functionality of proof-of-work technologies to eliminate potential blind spots, provide a more well-rounded understanding of the risks and rewards of proof-of-work protocols like Bitcoin, and positively contribute to the development of more informed public policy in support of the March 2022 US Presidential Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity. Utilizing a grounded theory methodology, the author combines different concepts from diverse fields of knowledge (e.g. biology, psychology, anthropology, political science, computer science, systems security, and modern military strategic theory) to formulate a novel framework called ""Power Projection Theory."" Based on the core concepts of Power Projection Theory, the author inductively reasons that proof-of-work technologies like Bitcoin could not only function as monetary technology, but could also (and perhaps more importantly) function as a new form of electro-cyber power projection technology which could empower nations to secure their most precious bits of information (including but not limited to financial bits of information) against belligerent actors by giving them the ability to impose severe physical costs on other nations in, from, and through cyberspace. The author calls this novel power projection tactic ""softwar"" and explores its potential impact on national strategic security in the 21st century. Like most grounded theory research efforts, the primary deliverable of this thesis is a novel theory rather than deductive analysis of a hypothesis derived from existing theory.

I was thinking about whether it makes a difference to use one more powerful mining chip vs two half as powerful mining chips.

If you have two separate chips hashing, the chance of them calculating the same hash would increase with the time until a block is found. If that would happen they would have wasted some time and theoretically be less efficient. 

A powerfull Antminer has more than 100 chips in that one miner. Do the mining chips share all their hash calculation results so they don´t try the same number again?

What about in a mining pool. Do all miners in that pool communicate about which calculations they already tried?

Reddit,bitcoin,Why Bitcoin Isn’t Just Financial Freedom—It’s a Revolution in How We Value,2024-10-28 20:05:18,"TL;DR this is a longform post about Bitcoin and Philosophy. Not finance.

I’ve seen a lot of posts on this sub asking where to find “good” content, and this is my attempt to offer something different. Be the change you want to see, just don't look at the comments (that's what I tell myself).

My background is in psychology, economics, and tech, so here’s a casual look at some ideas that have shaped my thinking on Bitcoin and blockchain technology. I have been involved in bitcoin since 2014. This post pulls from books and thinkers who have influenced my views, and I'll be discussing concepts and conclusions found in the following:

Lyn Alden: Concepts from Broken Money

Mark Fisher: Themes from Capitalist Realism

Hellenistic & Stoic Philosophy: Ideas from Plato and Aristotle, especially their mathematical influences

Stowe & Howe: Generations: concepts in human generational theory (I often see The 4th Turning referenced on reddit, but rarely the parent text.

Ken Wilber: Integral Theory, which takes a dynamic, interconnected approach to life based in modern psychology.

I want to be clear that this is all built on the idea's of others, who have also helped me in my journey through life.

Here’s a look at how calculus, Integral Theory, and Spiral Dynamics apply to Bitcoin and its role as generational technology for preserving accumulated value and knowledge. Here is each concept individually in relation to bitcoin:

Part One: Calculus, at its core, is about accumulation over time. Bitcoin, as digital “hard money,” works similarly—it captures the cumulative value of human productivity and innovation. Each transaction or block is like a “derivative” that strengthens the network, letting value grow in a decentralized and resilient way. In this sense, Bitcoin isn’t just static wealth; it’s a ledger of humanity’s collective effort and creativity, preserved over time.

Part 2: Through Quadrant Theory and it's multi-dimensional viewpoints, bitcoin is better described as a cultural phenomenon reshaping how we understand value across these dimensions. Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory has four perspectives (Quadrants) —individual mindset, behavior, collective culture, and systems. Bitcoin touches each one: 

* Mindset: Bitcoin changes personal values, fostering independence, financial responsibility, and long-term thinking. 
* Behavior: It influences people’s saving and spending habits by promoting low time-preference behavior (e.g., saving rather than spending impulsively). 
* Culture: Bitcoin creates a new ideology of wealth and decentralization, challenging traditional financial systems. 
* Systems: The blockchain and its decentralized network represent a generational shift, establishing a resilient, trustless system.

Part 3: Bitcoin as an Evolution in Wealth shown though Spiral Dynamics. Spiral Dynamics, a model of human consciousness, shows how Bitcoin appeals to cohorts operating from different levels, here are 3 examples: Profit-Driven paradigm: Bitcoin is a strategic investment, a hedge against inflation, and a tool for financial independence. Community driven paradigm: It resonates with decentralization and financial inclusion, disrupting traditional power structures. Integral paradigm: Here, Bitcoin becomes part of a balanced ecosystem valuing privacy, sustainability, and global inclusivity. As Bitcoin progresses through these levels, it shifts from purely financial utility to a transformative tool for social and economic evolution.

  
All Together Here We Go: 

Bitcoin combines knowledge from mathematics, economics, computer science, and game theory, creating a system that stores not just wealth but also a collective record of human innovation. The blockchain is like a calculus-based ledger where each block represents accumulated value, preserving snapshots of wealth over time.

Seen through Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics, Bitcoin is a dynamic system that holds value, resilience, and the ideals of decentralization. It’s more than money—it’s a blueprint of our evolving societal values.

For individuals, Bitcoin can represent more than financial security; it’s a commitment to preserving value across generations. Its deflationary nature promotes long-term thinking, encouraging people to view their holdings as part of a larger legacy. Over time, Bitcoin might be seen as a tool not only for personal wealth but for preserving our collective progress.

In this way, I can conceptualize Bitcoin as a generational tool that reflects humanity’s evolving consciousness.

Reddit,bitcoin,Why Self-Custody is a Must? My Bitcoin journey through lost wallets and closed exchanges!,2024-10-28 17:25:52,"There are many reasons to use self-custody with Bitcoin, but here are my reasons based on my experiences (the full list is much longer):

1. In the past, I opened a wallet on Blockchain.com. I transferred some BTC there and later moved it to my self-custody hardware wallet. Recently, I found access to some of my old wallets on the internet, so I decided to check them out for nostalgia. I logged into Blockchain, but there was no activity history for any of my transactions. It even asked me to enter my phone number for verification which wasn’t required last time. In short, they erased my activity. If my Bitcoin had still been there, it could have been lost.
2. I also had another wallet on wallet.btc.com, which no longer exists. When I visited BTC.com, it redirected me to cloverpool.com.  When I tried to log in, it asked for my phone number, and my usual email and password login didn’t work. If I remember correctly, I used their service for mining and transferred my mining earnings to my wallet on Blockchain, and eventually to my hardware wallet. Luckily, I did, because otherwise, my Bitcoin would have been lost.
3. I bought Bitcoin on exchanges like LocalBitcoins and VirWoX and always transferred it to my hardware wallet, which I learned from this Bitcoin subreddit. To be honest, it felt like extra steps and a bit annoying, However, this step is crucial because **every single exchange I used back then is now out of business!** I used to think people who owned exchanges must be very wealthy since they had so much Bitcoin to sell. But now, they’re gone, while my Bitcoin is safe in my hardware wallet.

Remember, “**Not your keys, not your coins.**” If you can’t afford to lose your Bitcoin on an exchange when Bitcoin reaches $1 billion USD someday, do yourself a favor and be your own bank with Bitcoin. It may feel like an extra step at first, but eventually, it becomes a part of you.

Thanks for reading! It feels great to give back to the Bitcoin community for all it’s given me, without asking for anything in return. Thanks again, and may Bitcoin be with you!",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Hello r/CC! $HEGE will be sponsoring the subreddit over the next 3 days - banner, AMA and giveaway!",2024-10-28 11:26:03,"https://preview.redd.it/ldh7g60sehxd1.jpg?width=2125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e70a28031450a08d1c29986fdc0a64a6012be78

# [Here at $HEGE](https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/) we're well aware of the stigma around memecoins, so we'd like to answer your questions. 

# In a sea of scams on the Solana blockchain, we aim to provide a secure and trusted environment for our holders.

Hege Coin was launched by a developer (myself) that got rug pulled A LOT. Fed up with this, I decided to create my own project. Working as a graphic and brand designer, I had the creative skills needed to start a project, and some knowledge of the Solana ecosystem.

I initially had many questions on how to successfully launch a coin and turned to Reddit, specifically , looking for advice. The post received a huge response and sparked a lot of interest. After a few weeks of presale and countless tweaks to the characters, website and tokenomics, we launched. $2M market cap on night one, a sharp drop the following day and an organic rise to an all time high of $31M a few months later, it’s been quite the journey!

**Hege is a Solana memecoin, with a unique twist...**  
Hege is a hedgehog with a quest to impress his crush Hegena. We've gamified the token by creating 10 chapters to his story, every chapter is released at various market cap levels, with chapter 10 being released at a $1 billion market cap. The production value has increased with each milestone, with the upcoming chapter 5 (unlocked at $50M) taking over a month to animate.

**Why has Hege been successful?**  
An engaging narrative and widespread appeal has been the key. We have built a brand that includes a cast of relatable characters and a story that is easy to connect with. The Hege story features 4 characters, Hege, Hegena, Hendrix and Helena. These characters are all built around stereotypes we see everyday in modern society, creating a story that is relatable and easily memeable.

The project has attracted a talented team and creative community that has been creating Hege content and helping spread the word since day 1. We currently have 12,800 holders, 6,200 members on Telegram, 22.2K followers on X, 8K subscribers on Youtube, over 1K followers over Instagram/Facebook and almost 500 images/videos in our meme folder.

**Born on Reddit, thriving on Reddit**  
It all started here on Reddit with a single post on the Solana subreddit , and since then Reddit has remained our most successful promotional platform. We've been labelled the 'King of Reddit' in the memecoin space multiple times, as a large percentage of our community have discovered us here. We're aware Reddit is the first place many new memecoin investors go, therefore investing in Hege means you're betting on the fact that retail will come flooding into Reddit as the bull run really starts to accelerate.

**An NFT Collection (with utility)**  
Last month, we launched[ Hegends](https://app.hegecoin.com/), a collection of 2,222 NFTs that pay a dividend to its holders. The public mint sold out in 90 minutes, and they are now trading on Tensor & Magic Eden. From the mint proceeds, we raised over $200,000 that will ALL be invested back into the project in one way or another. Whether that's buybacks, marketing funds, CEX listing fees or investments in further utility, it will ALL stay in the Hege ecosystem.

The NFTs feature a utility where every month, 5% of Hege tokens in the mint wallet will be distributed amongst NFT holders. Each NFT held will entitle a holder to distribution from the bank, and the collection features 5 rarity levels that multiply the amount of $HEGE tokens you receive, ranging from 1X for common NFT holders, all the way up to 10X for legendary NFT holders.

**Giveaway**  
Enough of the talk about ourselves. We'd like to celebrate Hege making an appearance on r/CryptoCurrency, we’re giving away **a total of $1000 to the best 5 questions asked below!** You must also follow the r/HegeCoin subreddit to be in with a chance of winning. Winners will be asked for a Solana wallet address via DM on **November 2nd 2024**.

**AMA**  
Hege is a memecoin with no flashy tech, promises of changing the world or the way we transact, but we're honest about what we're doing and what we aim to achieve.

We think that memecoins are one of the best ways to bring awareness to Cryptocurrency, so we're wondering if you have objections to memecoins, what are they?",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The greatest attribute of Crypto is that it encourages people to question Fiat. Particularly when Central Banks are paving the way for CBDC's without any political mandate. ,2024-10-29 15:06:14,"When I first discovered Bitcoin I was a cynic and didn't mine/ buy any. However I was immediately fixated by it and the debate surrounding it. For the first time in my life I was starting to ask questions of the central bank paper notes and coins I had always known, but never questioned.

Back then this wasn't normal behaviour. One did not question money, one just did what they could to accumulate as much as they could. ""*Have you ever questioned what that note actually means?*"" I'd find myself blurting out in public. Only to be met with looks of ""*what the fuck you on about you fucking nutter*?"". 

At that point, it wasn't so much I'd found Bitcoin, rather I was finding out the bleak reality of the Fiat money I had never thought to question. This wasn't an opt in form of money with finite supply, but a currency I was forced to accept as legal tender with limitless supply. One that had been underpinned by gold under the Bretton Woods system until 1971 when the United States ended the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. 

At school, money often featured in education. How to count it, how it been used throughout history, how it was made... but never what it actually was, what stood for or what gave it value. Today when I zoom out on opinion it isn't Bitcoin or indeed any crypto isn't actually the most important thing, rather for the first time I history it's the swell of people now starting question the currency governments legally force them to use. 

Without any direct political mandate and without citizens being directly asked iglobal central banks are paving the way to launch central bank digital currencies. Preliminary public consultation on CBDC's is often non-existent or extremely limited. Historically, the way democracy is undermined by governments is by early/ muted announcement with little immediate action, using the passage of time to condition the public into thinking it's already been accepted by society before they gradually take action to phasing it in. This is exactly what's happening with CBDC's today. 

Global central banks do not have a mandate from the people to spend time and resources paving the way for Central Bank Digital Currencies... and yet they continue. These are digital currencies you will legally be forced to use and yet the vast majority of world are excluded from any conversation on them. In what could be one of the biggest changes to Fiat money for centuries citizens of any democratic society should have a voice. The fact they disproportionately don't should be a major red flag.

Crypto proponents had the right to optimistic in the same way crypto cynics have the right to be cynical. Open source development, code repositories, public/ decentralised blockchains and ultimately the option to opt in/ out in the free market is about as fair as any form of digital money can get. CBDC's not only won't offer this, currently there's no political mandate central banks should be looking at them at all.

**TLDR**

If nothing else, crypto has society asking tough questions of fiat money for the first time in decades if not centuries. Questions that we never thought to ask, rarely knew or were never taught. It has us questioning the extent of our freedom, the role of central banks and value of legal tender. This is important as (without any direct political mandate) governments and central banks conspire to roll out fiat 2.0 in the form of CBDC's largely without it citizens ever being asked.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What To Know About The Wash Sale Loophole + Tax Loss Harvesting Before Year-End ,2024-10-28 16:32:41,"***Disclaimer: USA ONLY, DYOR***

============================================================================

# Intro

I am a crypto-focused CPA (USA) and am currently reviewing tax loss harvesting opportunities for my clients as we approach year-end. MANY of my clients have unrealized losses they are sitting on across various tokens, and many of them are completely unaware to the tax benefits of selling the losers.

# The Basics

It is important to first understand some basic definitions:

* ""Tax Loss Harvesting"" is the act of intentionally selling underperforming assets at a loss in order to reduce capital gains from other investments. This strategy is widely used by savvy investors to strategically reduce tax burdens year over year.
* ""Wash Sales"" occur when a taxpayer sells stock or securities at a loss and, within 30 days before or after the sale, the taxpayer buys or acquires substantially identical stock or securities.

Due to the wash sale rule, the act of selling a stock to capture the tax loss and then rebuying it shortly after has been disallowed, making tax loss harvesting a tricky endeavor for those harvesting losses in stock but wishing to remain exposed to the position.

However, with crypto specifically, there is a HUGE loophole that is still open as of 2024, but could be closing in 2025. This very well could be the last year to take advantage of this loophole.

# Wash Sale Loophole

Similar to stock, many crypto investors likely have bags that are in the red. These assets with unrealized losses can be sold to realize the loss, which will reduce capital gains from other crypto, stock, real estate, etc and reduce overall tax burden.

So, what's the loophole?

As mentioned above, selling stock and securities at a loss and then rebuying the asset within 30 days is disallowed due to the wash loss rule, making tax loss harvesting tricky. However, the [definition of the Wash Sale](https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/glossary.jsp?term=wash%20sale) rule explicitly states it's applicable to stock and securities. Crypto, is NOT a stock or security, [but is rather viewed as property in the eyes of the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/digital-assets#:~:text=For%20U.S.%20tax%20purposes%2C%20digital,%2C%20owned%2C%20transferred%20or%20traded). As such, many tax lawyers have concluded that a taxpayer can easily defend the position that the wash loss rule does not apply to crypto. I am a CPA, not a lawyer, so don't take my word for it, check out tax lawyer Gordonlaw discussing it [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MZl3N2S3MwE). Joe Biden, when he was still running for president, had proposed to close the loophole in his 2025 tax bill, confirming that even the federal government acknowledge the IRS is unable to enforce the wash loss rule on crypto based on current wording of the law.

# What's the Benefit?

Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains from all sources (crypto, stock, real estate, etc.). For any remaining capital losses in excess of capital gains, up the $3k can be used to offset ordinary income. Any remaining amount after that will be carried forward to next year where the process repeats and will be used to offset capital gains and then up to $3k of ordinary income. Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

By applying this strategy, taxpayers can reduce taxable gains and reduce their tax burden by strategically harvesting losses. With crypto, if they still wish to remain exposed to the position, they can simply rebuy the asset without worry of the wash sale rule, effectively harvesting the loss and adjusting down the cost basis.

# What's the Risk?

If you sell an underperforming token and then rebuy it, you will harvest the loss in this tax year and adjust down the cost basis. By doing so, you will also reset the holding period clock for long term gains. So if the asset goes up in value, and is sold within 12 months, the gains would be short term.

# Conclusion

As we approach year-end, tax loss harvesting should be top of mind for crypto investors looking to offset capital gains or even just bank losses for future gains. Since the wash loss rule does not apply to crypto, there is a very advantageous loophole available to crypto investors allowing them to bank the loss and then rebuy the asset within 30 days to gain the benefit of the tax loss while still remaining exposed to the asset. Talk with your accountant and see if this strategy is right for you.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

ICON endorsed BWX as its first decentralized application (dApp), helping it raise millions in its ICO, but the project ultimately left investors empty-handed and abruptly shut down, which many would consider a rug pull / exit scam. 

ICON’s council members served on BWX's advisory team while promoting it within the ICON community, and they were reportedly compensated significantly for their involvement. While this endorsement initially gave BWX legitimacy, it’s unclear whether ICON’s leadership conducted sufficient due diligence to ensure BWX was a substantial and ethical project.

Adding to this, ICON has a history of announcing high-profile MOUs with major companies, many of which have not resulted in visible partnerships or real progress. This pattern raises further questions about ICON’s transparency and commitment to its community, especially given their involvement with BWX.

For those interested in diving deeper, I’ve documented as much of the story as I could along with my own observations and experiences in this article I wrote: [ICON Foundation \(ICX\) and its Promotion of Blue Whale Foundation \(BWX\), a rug pull after raising $21 million USD during its ICO.](https://medium.com/@naxy/icon-foundation-icx-and-its-promotion-of-an-exit-scam-blue-whale-foundation-bwx-of-millions-986d2d9b3dcb)

My attempts to share this information with the /r/helloicon community, a subreddit I managed during its peak years, resulted in a permanent ban for ""spreading FUD."" This was despite the fact that I was sharing an honest and accurate account. The moderator who banned me argued that this issue was ""old news"" from 2017, although the events I discussed were as recent as 2022—and relevant regardless of the timing.

If anyone has information or would like to share their experience regarding Blue Whale Foundation ($BWX) and ICON Foundation ($ICX), please reach out or leave a comment.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Avalanche Foundation Presents a Crypto Payment Card Visa,2024-10-29 08:41:12,"The Avalanche Foundation, the company behind the Avalanche blockchain, has introduced its new cryptocurrency Visa card. On 21 October, the company [announced](https://36crypto.com/crypto-news-digest-todays-top-5-must-read-headlines/) the launch of the Avalanche Card, which allows for payments in cryptocurrencies, on social network X. 

Both physical and virtual versions of the Avalanche Card will be accessible, enabling users to pay anywhere Visa cards are accepted. According to the Avalanche Card website, the credit card is linked to a ‘self-secured wallet with a unique address for each asset’. 

The Avalanche Card website states that the card will initially be available to people living in Latin America and the Caribbean. Additionally, the card information indicates that there is no fee associated with using the Avalanche Card; nonetheless, users are advised to review the whole list of cards and service fees that are included in the card’s terms and conditions of use. 

The cryptocurrency industry has long offered users a variety of cryptocurrency payment options, both through cards such as Bybit Card, Gate Card, WhiteBIT Card and Coinbase Card, and payment solutions such as BinancePay, CryptoPay, BitPay, and Whitepay. Crypto payments can be made from anywhere in the world, and there are no limits on who can make or receive them.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Ben Cowen has absolutely nailed his predictions over the last two years.,2024-10-29 19:33:19,"I think it’s time Benjamin Cowen gets more credit for his spot-on analysis, especially for those who’ve been following him since June 2022. Back then, he boldly called for Bitcoin dominance to rise to 60% and for the ETH/BTC ratio to drop to the 0.03–0.04 range. At that time, ETH/BTC was sitting comfortably around 0.07–0.08, and let’s be honest—most people thought he was way off the mark. Yet here we are in October 2024, and both targets have been hit.

What’s impressive here is that Cowen didn’t just make a lucky call. His approach is based on data-driven, long-term analysis, using models that incorporate everything from logarithmic regression to risk-adjusted returns. He recognized a trend that wasn’t immediately obvious to others. A lot of people dismissed him as overly conservative or just “doom and gloom” on altcoins, but his strategy paid off big time. Those who listened to his calls in June 2022 and rotated from ETH to BTC have effectively doubled their ETH value, even if indirectly, simply by following Cowen’s recommendations.

This kind of success isn’t just luck; it’s a solid validation of his methods and his ability to see where the market’s heading over the long term. He’s not the type to hype up “moonshots” or get caught in short-term volatility traps—his focus has always been on long-term trends.

For anyone who’s serious about crypto and values risk-adjusted returns, I think it’s worth revisiting some of Cowen’s work and giving his analysis the respect it deserves.",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

I am not going to link to the most recent video I just watched, but they are all pretty much the same. ""Hey let's use AI to write us a script that makes us a bunch of money! It's super easy!""

Extra funny because in the video I watched, he literally goes to ChatGPT and asks for the script... to which ChatGPT instantly starts explaining how it can't be done... I guess they don't expect you to actually read anything :)

Well, I am sure the point is to get you to just go to the description and hopefully find code that you can copy and paste, and sure enough he has a handy link to the full code that will make anyone a millionaire! How nice!

Well, let's use ChatGPT (in my case Claude) against him. Copy and paste that code and ask the AI what the ""true intentions"" are and...

> This code is actually a cryptocurrency scam contract disguised as a ""1inch Slippage Bot"". Here's the technical analysis of its true purpose:
> 
> 1. Deceptive Presentation:
>  - The code presents itself as a trading bot that supposedly interacts with Uniswap/1inch for arbitrage
>  - It includes many functions with legitimate-sounding names like `findNewContracts`, `checkLiquidity`, etc.
>  - Most of these functions are actually smokescreens that don't perform real trading operations
> 
> 2. True Functionality:
>  - The core functionality is in the `start()` and `withdrawal()` functions
>  - Both functions ultimately do the same thing: transfer all ETH in the contract to a hardcoded address that's assembled from pieces scattered throughout the code
>  - The `fetchMempoolData()` function concatenates several strings that, when decoded, form the attacker's wallet address
> 
> 3. Key Malicious Components:
>  - The contract uses string manipulation to obscure the destination address
>  - Multiple functions like `getMempoolShort()`, `getMempoolLog()`, etc. each return parts of the attacker's address
>  - The `startExploration()` function converts these hex strings into an Ethereum address
>  - `getBa()` retrieves the contract's entire balance for transfer
> 
> This is a variant of a common cryptocurrency scam where malicious actors create contracts that look legitimate but actually just steal deposited funds. The complex code and legitimate-sounding function names are meant to make the contract appear genuine to casual observers or less experienced developers.

Ah, so tricking the user into sending their own funds. How nice...

Now for the fun and sad part... Since we have the code, we have the scammer's address. Simply ask AI to extract it (don't even need AI, it's literally just the strings in the code), plop that into a chain explorer, and what do we find? As of writing, that address is sitting at a balance of ~2.11 ETH, almost $5,300 USD.

######Excerpts:

.

>The upshot is that the digital-asset industry is caught in a Catch-22 of the SEC’s making: 

>The SEC sues digital-asset developers and exchanges seeking punitive, retroactive penalties for their purported failure to “come in and register.” But the agency simultaneously refuses to explain on the record, through a rulemaking, how the compliance it demands is even possible. 

>The SEC has even openly denied that it has an obligation to make compliance with its rules feasible at all.

.

>Nor has the SEC explained how it reads the securities laws to encompass digital assets when many traditional assets—including real estate, commodities, and trading cards—have never been subject to SEC jurisdiction, even though they possess attributes the SEC appears to regard as indicative of a security. 

>Instead, as one court recently recognized in rejecting the SEC’s novel view, **the agency has spoken “out of both sides of its mouth” and has “le[ft] th[at] Court, the industry, and future buyers and sellers with no clear differentiating principle between tokens in the marketplace that are securities and tokens that aren’t.”**

>**In response, the SEC changed its position again, expressing its “regre[t]” for the “confusion” it created.** 

>“Confusion” is an understatement, as even a small sampling of the SEC’s contradictory positions over the past couple of years reveals:

""Pineapple Fund was an experiment in philanthropy with cryptocurrency wealth. What happens when your 'play-money' becomes a treasure chest, and you're past the satiety point of money?

""I decided to donate the majority of my cryptocurrency to charities around the world, with an open application process and funding charities big and small. I focused on causes I believe in, or causes I know will work from my experiences.""

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  forty-five months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, five cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Cardano, Litecoin, Polkadot** and **Bitcoin Cash.**

# September Winners and Losers

***September Losers*** – **LTC** turned in the worst performance, but still gained +7% this month.

# Overall Update – BNB dominates, ETH in distant second place, 70% of cryptos in green, DOT worst performing

As has been the case for most of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, **BNB** remains the dominant crypto in the portfolio, by far.  It is up **+1399%**, the $100 investment into **BNB** forty-five months ago now worth **$1503.  ETH** is in distant second place, up +256% followed by **XRP** in third place and **BTC** in fourth place.

At the bottom, **DOT** is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down **-48%** since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). 

# Bitcoin Dominance:

**BitDom** has bounced a bit since the beginning of the year, now sitting at 55.8% and is generally on an uptrend since early 2023. 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +196%.  The initial $1000 investment forty-five months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth **$2,962**. 

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

As most readers are aware, this is the sixth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of a crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +2% (total value $1,021)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +440% (total value $5,401)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +697% (total value $7,967) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +196% (total value $2,962)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -44% (total value $558) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +71% (total value $1,714)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +8% (total value $1,080)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,703**

**That’s up +196%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/zjg53279naxd1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe39782bf853a8d54822ed48edc89f1192509d2b

In summary: ***That’s a +196% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/yx1ad7kanaxd1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a29e74e79830e5a489b6e87d36a7620103f4101

The S&P 500 Index is up **+52%** since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto forty-five months ago would be worth **$1,520** had it been redirected to the S&P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+196%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto forty-five months ago is now worth **$2,962.**

That’s a difference of **$1,442** on a $1k investment in forty-five months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first seven years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,136 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,278 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,767 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,520 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,198 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,487 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,197 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+65%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+196%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined seven year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&P up to this point:

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,How's Benjamin Cowen premium membership? Worth $1399 a year?,2024-10-29 04:15:13,"I've been not paying much attention to crypto lately while having most of my net worth still in crypto, specifically in Ethereum, which has kinda disappointing performance for past few years...

Now I know Benjamin Cowen are hated here, and in fact I used to think like most people here too, all these guy are just making money off subscription and give useless info, but later I found out Benjamin Cowen has been consistent in ""heavy in Bitcoin"" and is right about that, I decided to watch some of his recent videos.

And to be honest it is not what I expecting like every single other ""crypto analyst"" out there, he doesn't do much of price prediction and repeat that it is impossible for do price prediction, and what he is doing is more of like predicting what is the likely direction/development for crypto, and how you can reasonably allocate crypto portfolio based on that, plus your tolerance level, of course.

Now I really dislike short term trading or chasing project, and actually prefer approach that is more to strategic allocation, with a mid to longer time frame in mind, so I am the right audience for his membership, but I wanted more opinion, so anyone has opinion on this?

Is there any other crypto analyst out there, paid or not, that also focus on mid to long term portfolio strategy? ",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

I am currently thinking about accepting crypto on my platform and I also am thinking about ""crypto only"" payments for the website. 

I even talked to a local company who provides payment gateways and they let us accept currencies such as BTC, ETH and USDT (I know they have a few more options but I'm not sure which were they, maybe TRX or SOL). 

Now, my question is that what should I consider when I offer a crypto-only payment system? You may have guessed it, my main problem is the customer's trust specially with all these scams in the crypto space. ",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Safeguarding Satoshi’s Stash - Jameson Lopp ,2024-10-27 15:48:43,"From what I see on his Twitter account, he believes in Bitcoin, and wants to protect it for the future.  What needs to happen to get this conversation going in the right direction?

The quick take if you can't watch:

Bitcoin has to upgrade cryptography... as quantum computing is approaching capabilities putting today's cryptography at risk.  Crypto has to deal with it just like everyone else has to.  

So while It's not a bitcoin specific problem, there are reasons bitcoin needs to be ahead of the game, and needs more time to address it properly. 

Yes, some tough decisions must be made.  And yes, it will take a lot of work.  And there will be impacts and tradeoffs. 

But anything looking to stand the test of time must tackle a changing landscape without fear, and without blinders from outdated understandings of potential risk.

I've been posting on this a while as I've learned from following projects that talk about it often. The speculators believe/hope people may very well move to more secure options if nothing is done. 

I personally don't see that happening because it would be crazy if this isn't addressed, right?  We have advanced algos available to choose from, so why not tackle this?  Again,  some tough challenges, but the alternative is much much worse. 

I do however think as bitcoin prepares for this,  it will highlight the vision of these forward thinking projects that aim to serve other market needs of blockchain.  And sure, I won't mind when that narrative lands.  But even without a narrative (I hate the idea an investment depends on a narrative), I am looking to find projects that create business demand. 

So I am completely in favor of quantum resistance being addressed by bitcoin, even if people hate the difficulties it presents.

In my view, it's good for all crypto to lead the way with the next level of cryptography.

You're all in denial about alt season repeating like in former cycles. I see it everyday with people buying up shitcoins and everyone in those ""communities"" claiming they're all going to go 4x their previous ATH ""once the bullbrun starts.""

News flash. This is the bullrun. Previously, people would take BTC profits and pump up larger cap alts, take those profits and go to small caps and finally micro caps. More people are holding onto their BTC. Look at the charts, theres far fewer flash crashes. All metrics suggest this including BTC in cold storage and more inactive wallets than ever. This BTC progression in previous cycles saw the alt coin market going nuts. At this point, You could do a 4x on any random binance pair. The fomo was crazy. There's none of that now. Just bleeding alts to BTC.

Furthermore, people are skipping out on the larger cap speculation for the meme coin defi market. Raydium is seeing all the volume that traditionally went to CEX listed alts.

""But meme coins are stupid and serve no purpose, I only buy ""serious"" projects.

News flash. The alt coin you've been holding for 5 years is just as useless as ElonBadgerCoq on trader Joe's. It's done nothing. The team has accomplished nothing. You know this and still try to justify your investment so you can separate yourself from the degen gamblers buying cat tokens on some DEX. I don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. Its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale.

Yes, some projects will pump in the next year. Yes, some projects are genuinely good with great developers making amazing tech. But most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to ATHs. Price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. There's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper. No major publicly sold company cares about how decentralized something is.

Downvote me all you want. I know you really care about whatever ETH killer youve been stacking and holding. Some of you will get lucky and I hope you do. But for most, its not happening.

The reason why meme coins are so popular is because it's the streamlined, super fast paced version of the entire crypto market. It's the final format. A launch, a bunch of hype, the coin bleeds out, some people make some money, most lose. The coin drops close to 0 with all the bag holders claiming it will return to where it was.

Mainly with regard to how we’ve all lost out on Alt’s and there’s not going to be an Alt season!!",2024-10-26 15:16:59,"I have a largish Crypto portfolio, but it’s been built, not by FOMO, but by trying to do some analysis, based off reality and not hope.  I deliberately decided at the beginning, no BTC or ETH, because I thought they were well established, very little chance to do a 7X plus.   Like many, I wasn’t speculating to double my “FREE” money, I admit I was looking to make a bigger difference.  To do this I needed a Bear Market, and we got a long one starting basically 2022.  The point was to buy down on certain projects, I didn’t want to go all in or even to DCA, my idea was to look for dips and to keep trying to average down and be ready for the BULL.   

While I can see a point of view that the US is in the middle/early Bull, S&P500, BTC are without done well.  However, we can all see, there definitely hasn’t been an Alt Bull run.  But, of course many can point to individual coins that have already done well, for various reasons.  Reasons could be CEX failure, SOL due to FTX, or development, CKB for example.  

The continued dogma regarding “you’ll never see ATH again” and look at Market Cap, persist, yet they’re terrible metrics to use alone.  While it’s true, many won’t reach previous ATH’s, but if a coin/token is 90+% down from ATH, it’s definitely worth buying if it can reach 40%+ of its ATH, or a 4X+. 

I’ve deliberately left out meme coins here, why, because they’re a special breed and they need hype.  I’ve no idea where hype actually comes from, but some get it, while the majority don’t.  So, meme’ are a topic for another time.  

In my portfolio I have many coins still in the red, however, those in the green are at a much higher value, and therefore the portfolio as a total is in the green.   I’ve had many in the last three years go 3X to 7X and I’ve sold making gold profits, which have always been put back into other coins.  I’m even buy back into the coins sold as they’ve gone down enough again for me to believe they’ll make profit again.  

Additionally, along the way certain coins have been abandoned, or sold off as I didn’t believe they would recover sufficiently to compete with other opportunities I came across.  

I believe we’re poised to see a whole crypto upturn in the relatively near future, with 2025 being a year of reward for those that have believed in the “Return of the Alt’s”

Just an alternative view of the world, which I thought I’d bore you all with while I was rambling.  However, none of us posting these views, either way, are experts or prophets, believe in your strategy, refine it to suit circumstances.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Bolivia Takes a Bold Step Amid an Economical Crisis: Pioneers Regulated Crypto Custody Service (USDT), Expanding Financial Options for Citizens",2024-10-26 16:35:36,"In a move that promises to transform the Bolivian financial landscape, Banco Bisa has announced the implementation of an innovative custody service for virtual assets, specifically USDT, that allows clients to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies safely and efficiently. Franco Urquidi, Vice President of Business at the financial institution, highlighted that all transactions must be made to and from an account at Banco Bisa, which guarantees a high level of security. 

This new service offers clients the possibility of holding funds in USDT for as long as they wish, making payments abroad and even sending money to relatives studying abroad. “The sky is the limit,” said Urquidi, referring to the future functionalities that the bank plans to offer in this area.

 USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain its value at parity with the US dollar. This makes it a “stablecoin” or stable currency, whose value is backed by dollar reserves. The idea is that each USDT in circulation is backed by a dollar in the accounts of Tether Limited, the company that issues this currency, which helps stabilize its price. 

The director of the Financial System Supervision Authority (ASFI), Yvette Espinoza, supported the initiative by pointing out that Banco Bisa is a pioneer in offering this service within a regulatory framework that guarantees the security and confidence of users. ""This is a custody service that will allow clients to carry out various operations safely, reducing the risk of unsafe interactions in the cryptocurrency market,"" said Espinoza.

The vice president of Banco Bisa also emphasized the importance of financial education in the use of virtual assets. To this end, the bank has established strategic alliances with recognized international custody and exchange companies, thus ensuring data protection and the prevention of illicit activities. ""Our clients go through a rigorous verification process, which gives them the peace of mind that their transactions are carried out through safe and reliable channels,"" added Urquidi.

 Furthermore, the cost of this service is affordable. USDT sales start at a minimum of 200 USDT up to a daily limit of 10,000, with fees ranging from 35 to 100 bolivianos, depending on the amount. Transfers to dollar accounts abroad cost Bs 280, representing an attractive option for those looking to use cryptocurrencies for international payments. 

With the recent authorization from ASFI for other financial entities to also offer services related to virtual assets, Banco Bisa is positioned as a leader in innovation in the Bolivian market. The entity is committed to training its users, ensuring that they understand both the benefits and risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies.

In short, Banco Bisa is not only ushering in a new era in the Bolivian financial sector, but is also setting a standard in security and financial education in the use of virtual assets.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Reddit,crypto,Falcon vs. Dilithium vs. SPHINCS+,2024-08-30 17:39:49,"What do you believe is the best choice.

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

This is more of a Falcon vs. Dilithium post as they seem to be the more commonly used.

Why should I prefer Dilithium over Falcon? Any opinions?",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241
Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-30 00:52:17.112241

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times
