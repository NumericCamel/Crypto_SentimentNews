If it becomes a reality, the token would almost certainly be one of the best cryptos to buy. The uproar has been caused by an alleged CoinDesk article, which all but confirmed Kanye’s meme coin ambitions. However, the market isn’t so sure anymore, as sources are saying CoinDesk received fake news. Nevertheless, the prediction market is seeing mind-blowing volumes ($18M+ at the time of writing) on the query of whether Kanye West will launch a meme coin by the end of February. The odds for ‘Yes’ spiked to 83% sometime yesterday but have since then settled around the 70% mark. The fall is likely due to the fact that February 28 is approaching quickly and there has been no official news on a potential YE token. Not on his website Yeezy.com, his X, or anywhere else. Rogue $YZY Token Rug Pulls As unfortunate as it is, an unregulated $YZY token started doing the rounds almost immediately after the rumors surfaced. It ended up becoming a rug pull, losing more than 80% of its value after the pump and dump. Although a Kanye West meme coin would certainly be cause for celebration for meme coin opportunists, even if it doesn’t see the light of day, the tokens mentioned in this post can still 100x your crypto portfolio in no time. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy for Bitcoin Supporters The toughest part about being a meme coin investor is gathering assurance about a token’s hype. After all, you just never know whether a meme coin’s seemingly revolutionary idea will resonate with everyone. However, what if there were a meme coin that was based on the growth of the larger crypto market? That’d be a surefire winner, right? We present to you BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). BTC Bull Token will reward token holders with free $BTC whenever Bitcoin reaches new price milestones. These checkpoints are $50K apart, meaning there’ll be $BTC airdrop events when $BTC crosses $150K, then $200K, $250K, and so on. This one-of-a-kind crypto project is already among the best presales of 2025. $2.5M+ in presale funding in less than two weeks is no joke, after all. 1 $BTCBULL is currently available for only $0.002375. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Layer 2 Solana Solution Solana has been struggling to maintain the increased number of investors on its network ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Transactions are taking ages (if not failing outright), scalability is in shambles, and Solana looks worn out. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX). As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy will optimize throughput while maintaining the network’s robust security and decentralization benefits. This means transactions will be carried out at a much quicker pace and at lower costs than before. Also, $SOLX is a multi-chain token. It’ll work just as smoothly on Ethereum as it will on Solana. This interoperability further cranks up its utility and, therefore, its potential to be the next crypto to explode. The $SOLX presale has been on fire ever since it first launched late last year. It has raised close to $23M at the time of writing and doesn’t look like slowing down. You can purchase one of the top new meme coins for just $0.001642 per token. Here’s how to buy $SOLX. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Official Crypto of the Most User-Friendly Crypto Wallet One of the best altcoins on the market right now, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of the best crypto wallet, Best Wallet. The name gives it away, doesn’t it? Best Wallet, in case you didn’t know, is easily the most intuitive and powerful wallet out there. Among its plethora of features, the fact that it’s fully self-custodial stands out. This means it isn’t controlled by any crypto exchange or company. Privacy in crypto redefined! What’s more, it’s also a multi-currency wallet that supports cross-chain interoperability. Simply put, if you use Best Wallet, you won’t have to rely on any other service for buying, selling, or swapping cryptos. Why buy $BEST? Primarily because it will be the biggest beneficiary of Best Wallet’s growth. And grow it will. The wallet is on its way to capturing 40% of the crypto wallet market by 2026. Secondly, $BEST will supercharge the Best Wallet ecosystem for its token holders. They’ll get exclusive perks, such as low transaction fees, early access to crypto presales, and higher staking rewards. The $BEST presale has amassed over $10M so far, and each token is currently being priced at $0.024075. But interested investors should hurry up because prices increase in the next 12 hours. 4. Broccoli ($BROCCOLI) – Popular Dog Meme Coin Dominating the Market If you want an example of just how wild a Kanye West meme coin could get, all you have to do is look at which token has been dominating the top gainers list since the last 10 days. It’s $BROCCOLI. Inspired by the pet dog of Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, the ex-CEO of Binance and a crypto legend, $BROCCOLI is up over 952% since its debut just over a week ago. That’s what happens when a popular personality dips their toes in the meme coin frenzy. All CZ did was drop his dog’s name (Broccoli) and picture on X, as well as talk candidly about the ‘likelihood’ of launching a meme coin. That’s all it took for new $BROCCOLI tokens to flood the market. $BROCCOLI is currently trading at $0.03983, rising by over 18% again today. At one point, it was up 50% today. A positive buying signal is that the token underwent a nice little consolidation after skyrocketing initially and has only just broken out of a descending triangle pattern. Bottom Line As always, make sure you take the crypto market’s volatility into account when investing. Market hype can be both a boon and a curse, depending on when you get it. It’s also why we recommend that you only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, this article isn’t a substitute for financial advice from a professional. Kindly do your own research before diving into crypto and meme coins.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Cardano Must Hold Critical Support Around $0.67 To Sustain Bull Run – Details,2025-02-22 10:30:15+00:00,"Cardano is trading above key demand levels after a volatile Friday that saw prices react sharply to the Bybit $1.5+ billion hack news. Bybit is a top cryptocurrency exchange. The market-wide panic took prices from local highs to critical demand zones, with Cardano dropping over 7% in less than six hours. Fear spread quickly, driving prices down as investors worried about further downside pressure. However, Bybit’s quick response and assurances have helped restore confidence, preventing a more aggressive selloff. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support – Analyst Doubts Bears Can Defend $4K Anymore Despite the turbulence, Cardano remains above crucial support, suggesting that bulls are still in control as long as these levels hold. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that the most critical support zone for Cardano (ADA) is between $0.67 and $0.80. This range serves as a strong demand area where accumulation has historically occurred. Holding this level is crucial for ADA’s short-term outlook, as a breakdown below could trigger further selling pressure. With market sentiment stabilizing and key support levels intact, ADA could be positioned for a rebound. However, bulls need to reclaim lost ground quickly and push back above resistance levels to confirm a stronger recovery. All eyes remain on the broader market reaction following Bybit’s security breach. Cardano Bulls Holding Key Demand Cardano is trading at key demand levels that could serve as a strong base for a recovery rally. Bulls remain cautious as volatility and uncertainty continue to drive most altcoins into lower demand zones. The extreme selling pressure seen across the market since late December has shown no signs of stopping, leaving many investors on edge. Despite this, there is growing optimism that Cardano could soon reverse its bearish trend and begin a strong rally. Technical indicators suggest that ADA is at a critical point, where a sustained hold above key demand levels could set the stage for a significant move upward. Martinez’s technical analysis on X highlights that the most critical support zone for Cardano is between $0.67 and $0.80. This price range has historically served as a strong accumulation zone, and as long as it holds, the broader bull run remains intact. If ADA successfully defends this range, bulls could regain confidence and push the price toward higher resistance levels. A breakout above key supply levels could accelerate buying pressure, triggering a move back toward previous highs. However, if selling pressure intensifies and ADA breaks below support, further downside could follow. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal The Most Critical Resistance For Bitcoin – Can BTC Break $97.5K? With market sentiment improving following Bybit’s security breach resolution, investors are watching closely for signs of strength in Cardano’s price action. Those who have been accumulating during this consolidation phase could benefit from an eventual uptrend if bullish momentum returns. Holding above the $0.67–$0.80 zone will be crucial in determining whether ADA can recover and reclaim lost ground in the coming weeks. Price Testing A Critical Level Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.75 after another failed attempt to reclaim the $0.82 mark, a key resistance level that bulls have struggled to break. The short-term objective for bulls must be to push ADA above this level and hold it as support, signaling a shift in momentum toward the upside. A successful breakout would open the door for a test of the $0.85 level, which is aligned with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA)—a key indicator of short-term strength. For now, ADA remains in a consolidation phase, and bulls need to maintain control above the $0.73 level in the coming days. Holding this price range would confirm short-term strength and indicate a potential bullish recovery. If ADA fails to stay above $0.73, sellers could regain control and push the price lower, increasing the risk of a deeper correction. Related Reading: Solana Sweeps Lows But Recovers – Can Bulls Reclaim $185 by Friday? Market conditions remain uncertain, but if bulls reclaim $0.82, a strong rally could follow, driving ADA toward higher resistance levels.

Holding key support levels is essential for a sustainable recovery. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

The comment made by the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was a reaction to the report that another American state sought to establish a local version of US President Donald Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Related Reading: 10x Dogecoin: The ‘Secret Window’ You Need To Know, According To This Analyst Bitcoin Reserve Bill The proposal to create a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is gaining momentum as several US states passed legislation that seeks to establish a localized version of a BTC reserve and build their crypto portfolio. Satoshi Action Fund posted on its X account that Montana’s proposed House Bill No. 420 which seeks to create a localized Bitcoin reserve has been passed. “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation in Montana passes out of committee and moves onto a House floor vote,” Satoshi Action Fund said. Representative Curtis Schomer sponsored the BTC-related bill. “Montana becomes the 4th state to pass SBR out of committee. Utah, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Montana,” Dennis Porter, CEO and Co-Founder at Satoshi Action Fund, noted on his social media post. ‘No Escape’ With this development, CZ posted his thoughts on the Montana legislation, implying that Bitcoin has become an unavoidable reality while saying, “There is no other choice.” countries or individuals. There is no escape… It’s like, you can’t not use the internet (or money). 🤷‍♂️ — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 19, 2025 “You can buy bitcoins after the US government is done buying, or before,” CZ said in a post, indicating that buying the firstborn cryptocurrency is inescapable and that it is no longer a debate whether to buy or not but rather when investors should make a purchase. A crypto trader agrees with CZ’s opinion that no one can avoid BTC. “Front-run the biggest buyer in history, or wait until there’s nothing left. The choice isn’t if—it’s when.” The trader added that those late in adopting BTC will have to pay the premium for not making the move earlier. “Countries or individuals. There is no escape… It’s like, you can’t not use the internet (or money),” CZ replies to a crypto streamer who said that other countries are also thinking in the same way Montana did in creating a Bitcoin reserve. BNB Donation In a separate post, CZ emphasized the significance of crypto donations to help other individuals during disasters. The ex-Binance executive shared that his previous donation was returned to him with additional crypto, describing it as something unexpected. Earlier, CZ gave away 150 BNB worth $100,000 to crypto investors who lost their money in a pump-and-dump scheme related to the LIBRA coin, a digital asset that was briefly promoted by Argentina’s president, Javier Milei.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"As Bitcoin Sell Pressure Fades, Could A Local Bottom Be Forming? Analyst Explains",2025-02-22 07:30:43+00:00,"According to an X post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing a decline in sell-side pressure, indicating that a local market bottom may soon form for the premier cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin Local Bottom On The Horizon? Bitcoin continues to trade just below the psychologically significant $100,000 level, hovering at $98,650 at the time of writing. However, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is witnessing a notable drop in sell-side pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year CAGR Drops To 14.45% But Still Outshines Gold, Stocks – Details Martinez shared the following Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio chart from crypto analytics platform Glassnode, highlighting a sharp decline in the metric since mid-January 2025. This drop suggests that BTC may be forming a local price bottom, potentially leading to a new accumulation phase. For those unfamiliar, a declining sell-side risk ratio typically indicates that investors are holding onto their BTC rather than selling, signalling the early stages of an accumulation phase where prices may stabilize or begin to rise. Martinez’s analysis aligns with broader crypto market cycle theories, which suggest that market bottoms are often followed by an accumulation phase. This phase, in turn, paves the way for a potential price increase. However, BTC must hold above key support levels to confirm this outlook. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital weighed in on Bitcoin’s price action, emphasizing the importance of a weekly close above $97,000 to maintain its higher low as support. The analyst shared a Bitcoin weekly chart, noting that while BTC has seen multiple wicks below its symmetrical triangle structure, the overall bullish pattern remains intact. However, failure to close above $97,000 on the weekly timeframe could increase the risk of further downside. Similarly, fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades shared a bullish perspective, pointing out that BTC recently had a “solid break” from a descending channel structure. The analyst added: Just need to see the continuation now into the weekend to get a good base going into next week. $98K is key in the short term. Is BTC Primed For A New All-Time High? While Martinez suggests that BTC may be forming a local bottom, other analysts believe the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a move beyond $108,000, potentially reaching a new all-time high (ATH). Analyst Kevin, for instance, predicts that a short squeeze could propel BTC to $111,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk?

CryptoQuant CEO Says Altseason Already Begun,2025-02-22 06:00:40+00:00,"As the cycle progresses, many investors are awaiting the long-anticipated Altseason, with opinions split on whether it will happen. Several market watchers have affirmed that Altcoins (Alts) are getting ready for an explosive breakout, but others, including CryptoQuant’s CEO, have suggested a different outlook. Related Reading: Nansen’s Bitcoin On-Chain Analytics Reveal 42% Increase In BTC Transactions Few Cryptocurrencies To ‘Survive’ The Altseason On Friday, Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s founder and CEO, affirmed that the Altseason has begun. In an X thread, Ju suggested that there will not be a direct Bitcoin-to-alt rotation this cycle, noting that “stablecoin holders are favoring” Altcoins. According to Ju, Bitcoin is no longer a quote cryptocurrency, adding that Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance doesn’t define the altseason anymore. In a December post, he explained that “Altcoins used to move together based on their correlation with BTC,” however, this pattern has now broken. Instead, he stated that trading volume is the metric that defines it, with Altcoins currently having 2.7x the volume of Bitcoin. Ju also considers this to be a very selective and challenging altseason, with only a few Altcoins with strong user cases and narratives expected to thrive. He added that, despite good market sentiment, there isn’t fresh liquidity, which “feels like a PvP fight over a fixed pie.” As a result, Altcoin battles “are getting fiercer,” and only a few are pumping this altseason and attracting new liquidity. Altcoin markets are currently a zero-sum PvP game. While Bitcoin has doubled its market cap, the alt market cap is still below its previous ATH, rotating among themselves without fresh capital inflows. Only a few Alts with strong use cases and narratives will survive. Altcoins Ready For Next Leg Up Trader Crypto Yoddha suggested that Altcoins are “ready for round 2” after its recent performance. According to the post, the crypto market, excluding BTC and ETH, is following 2020-2021’s playbook. During the last cycle, Altcoins experienced two legs towards its cycle top and all-time high (ATH) of $1.13 trillion. In the “first round,” they broke out from its accumulation period, seeing a small re-accumulation phase before surging to the previous top. After reclaiming this resistance level, Altcoins started “round two,” achieving various new highs before hitting a new cycle top. Yoddha pointed out that the market is finishing the first round, as it tested last cycle’s top during the post-election pump. Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that the crypto market cap, excluding the top 10 tokens, “has completed the second part of its Double Bottom formation.” He explained that Altcoins had been consolidating between the $250 billion to $280 billion range since the February 3 correction.

Similarly, analyst Carl Runefelt stated that Altcoins have a parabolic move after breaking out of its two-month descending channel. Alts saw a 120% climb after breaking out of a 2024 multi-month descending channel. Altcoins must reclaim the $300 billion resistance to break from this pattern.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,XRP Bulls Need This Break For A Shot At $6,2025-02-22 04:30:07+00:00,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto (@egragcrypto) has outlined both short-term and long-term trajectories for XRP, pinpointing potential upside targets that range from $4–$6 in the near term to $33–$60 over the long haul. The shared chart focuses on historical resistance levels, Fibonacci extension points, and a multi-phase Parabolic Arc formation. XRP Eyes $6—But This Key Level Stands In The Way Egrag Crypto’s chart shows XRP trading near $2.67, coming off a notable bullish surge but now contending with a red horizontal band between roughly $2.75 and $3.00. The upper boundary at $3.00 holds dual significance: it marks a psychologically important level and also corresponds to a critical area from previous cycle peaks. A monthly close above this line would strongly suggest a bullish continuation, potentially setting the stage for a move toward the next Fibonacci extension marks. “XRP current price action is trading at $2.67, showing a strong bullish move but facing resistance at the red horizontal zone (~$2.75-$2.83-$2.910 and $3.00),” Egrag states. The analyst particularly highlights Fib 1.414 near $4.30 and Fib 1.618 around $6.40 as the next barriers if $3.00 is decisively broken. A volume surge would strengthen the bullish case and provide extra confirmation for the run to unfold. Related Reading: XRP Price Consolidation Completed: Will Wave 3 Propel Prices Beyond The $5 Barrier? Failure to overtake $3.00, however, could trigger a correction back into the $1.90–$2.00 support region identified by earlier candle closes. Egrag Crypto notes that if $1.90 fails to hold, a more extensive drop toward $0.90–$1.00 could ensue, which the analyst labels as a potential “Black Swan” scenario likely driven by broader market turmoil rather than XRP-specific weakness. Egrag writes: “Breaking below $1.90 could shift sentiment to bearish, introducing downside risks toward the $0.90-$1.00 range. This would signal a potential Black Swan event across all markets! Such a collapse would be a challenging prelude before the ignition stage for XRP. Honestly, I don’t favor this scenario, as it would be stressful for all of us, including many OGs. Could the upcoming fort knox auditing be the catalyst for this Black Swan.” Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring In the long term, the chart presents three sweeping parabolic arcs—colored yellow, green, and blue—which suggest that XRP may be building a broad-scale bullish structure. Price targets in the $33–$60 range reflect these arcs and channel extensions, though much hinges on whether a monthly close above $3.00 can usher in sustained momentum. Beyond the $6.40 level at Fib 1.618, Egrag Crypto identifies additional Fibonacci-related checkpoints, such as $8, $13, $27, and $67 (Fib 1.888). These higher levels would remain speculative until XRP clears the nearer hurdles and demonstrates stable volume influx and price structure. “Volume and momentum confirmation would be crucial in the[se] coming phases,” he adds. While the path forward depends on technical breakouts, Egrag Crypto underscores that near-term movement around $3.00 will be pivotal for setting the tone. A successful break above resistance could confirm targets in the $4–$6 window, and eventually open the door to the lofty parabolic objectives. At press time, XRP traded at $2.6198.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitfinex Whale Activity Increases As Bitcoin Approaches $100k—Further Surge Ahead?,2025-02-22 03:00:10+00:00,"Following a lackluster performance in recent weeks, Bitcoin appears to be seeing a steady recovery with its price now approaching the $100,000 price mark. Particularly, so far, BTC has managed to regain some of the losses shedded in recent weeks with its price now hovering above $98,000, marking a 2.6% increase in the past 7 days. Alongside this price movement, new data have emerged highlighting significant activity among large holders on exchanges, suggesting a shift in market dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs—Is a Market Breakout Around the Corner? Bitfinex Whales Show Increased Activity A CryptoQuant analyst known as Mignolet has recently shared a detailed outlook on exchange whales and their influence on the current price action in Bitcoin. Mignolet’s observations focus on leverage ratios across major trading platforms. According to his analysis, the “all exchange leverage ratio” is at an all-time high. This measure, which captures the amount of leverage being used on exchanges, reflects heightened activity that could precede significant price moves. Interestingly, while Binance has seen its leverage ratio drop back to levels last seen during last year’s consolidation phase, Bitfinex tells a different story. On Bitfinex, leverage ratios have surged sharply, aligning with a rise in open interest. Mignolet highlights that this activity points to a sudden increase in whale movements within the ongoing consolidation range. While these leverage ratios alone don’t guarantee a specific price direction, the sharp uptick on Bitfinex suggests a shift in market dynamics that bears watching. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the question now is: What are these whales aiming for? Mignolet’s analysis stops short of providing a definitive answer, but it raises the possibility of a major price shift soon. With Bitcoin’s price holding steady above $98,000, the actions of these large-scale traders could influence whether the market breaks higher or retreats back into a more extended consolidation phase. Bitcoin Encounters Potential Strong Support Zone Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to inch closer to the six-digit price mark which it recently fell below in the previous week. Although the asset is still roughly an 8.7% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) above $109,000 established in January, it has managed to see an uptick in price in the past few days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $98,091 marking a 1.2% increase in price over the past day. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the asset appears to be seeing a formation of a “massive demand zone just below the current price.” IntoTheBlock highlighted that should the market face further downward pressure around this area, the zone may act as strong support.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is It Time To Buy XRP? TD Sequential Says Yes,2025-02-22 01:30:21+00:00,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a buy signal on the hourly XRP price chart. XRP Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Setup On TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that XRP has seen recently. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator consists of two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. Once these candles, which don’t have to be one after the other, are printed on the chart, the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Plunges 58%: How Do Shiba Inu & Pepe Compare? The countdown phase begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase also works much in the same way, with the only difference being that candles here are counted up to thirteen, not nine. Once the countdown is finished, the asset can be assumed to have arrived at another potential turnaround. Where a TD Sequential signal might lead the price naturally depends on the type of candle that led to the phase’s completion. Green candles naturally mean a correction may be coming, while red ones suggest a bullish reversal. XRP has recently completed the former TD Sequential phase on its 1-hour price. Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows this pattern forming for the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the TD Sequential has finished a setup with nine red candles for XRP recently, which implies the cryptocurrency’s price can be considered to have reached a bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin RHODL Momentum Slowing Down—Analyst Warns Pattern ‘Not Ideal’ If the pattern indeed holds, then the asset would next see a rebound to the upside. Though, given the fact that this buy signal has formed on a short timeframe (1-hour), the surge resulting from the signal may not be too large. Speaking of the TD Sequential, XRP isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has displayed a bullish formation in its hourly price. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Steller (XLM) has also seen a buy setup recently. “Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart!” notes the analyst. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the signal would come to fruition for XRP and XLM or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.67, down 1% in the last seven days.

Dogecoin Whales Liquidate 100 Million Coins,2025-02-22 00:00:20+00:00,"The crypto market is paying attention to a massive Dogecoin (DOGE) transaction. A whale transferred 100 million DOGE, or about $25.42 million, to Binance. The move has raised questions about whether a sell-off is about to happen or if this is just another typical shift in holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Whale Activity Sparks Concerns When a major cryptocurrency holder moves a sizable amount of their holdings to an exchange, it usually means they want to sell. The price of DOGE may drop as a result, which would cause smaller investors to react. However, cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez noted a decline in whale activity overall, suggesting that major investors are not acting aggressively for the time being. Whale activity on the #Dogecoin $DOGE network has declined by nearly 88% since mid-November! pic.twitter.com/6X4CIH3mf8 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 DOGE’s present market performance points to vagueness. As of the time of writing, the price is $0.255622; an intraday high is $0.257605 and a low is $0.250725. These swings imply a rather limited trading range; but, if more significant holders decide to sell their shares, volatility might increase. Market Sentiment Remains Divided According to certain traders, the whale transfer is a bearish signal, while others believe that its influence may be negligible unless an influx of additional coins occurs. Dogecoin has a history of reacting sharply to whale movements; however, the aggregate selling pressure appears to be subdued this time. The ongoing discussion regarding a potential DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) is another significant factor that affects sentiment. If an ETF acquires momentum, it may attract institutional investors, potentially counteracting any selling pressure from whales. Nevertheless, the market is currently in a state of supposition, as no official approvals or timelines have been announced. The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the whale move, the price of DOGE continues to remain steady, but if market sentiment shifts, there could be a further drop. Further dumping may occur if the price of DOGE drops below $0.25, which might further lower the price. On the other hand, strong purchasing activity may act as a barrier to further decrease. Related Reading: Solana Faces Double Trouble: 55% Network Drop And Price Woes Investors’ Options The whale movement reminds us of the speed with which retail trade’s market dynamics could shift. Some people might decide to keep their positions since they hope that possible catalysts like the ETF will raise prices, while others take a more cautious approach, looking for signs of increased whale activity before deciding on what to do next.

In his analysis, Potts highlighted the $0.28 price level as being the next major milestone for DOGE as it eyes a breakout on its way to a new all-time high (ATH).  Why $0.28 Is The Next Major Milestone For Dogecoin’s Road To ATH In an X post, Dima Potts revealed that $0.28 would be the next major milestone for Dogecoin on its road to a new ATH. The analyst stated that he expects DOGE to move towards the $0.28 range, similar to the previous cycle. As such, he remarked that this range marks the next major milestone for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Historical Performance Says Dogecoin Price Could Surge To $2.2, Here’s How The analyst further noted that beyond this point, there would be an increase in volatility with the Dogecoin price consolidating before heading towards new yearly highs and eventually its ATH. In the meantime, Potts noted that the $0.25 price level continues to serve as a short-term support level that DOGE’s price should follow, just like in the 2017 cycle when this pattern emerged.  The analyst had earlier revealed that a similar pattern to the one in the 2017 cycle was emerging for Dogecoin in this cycle. He alluded to this pattern as why DOGE can rally to as high as $10 in this cycle. Potts remarked that he believes the meme coin will head towards its all-time highs and then much higher in the coming weeks, mirroring its 2017 performance.  Meanwhile, crypto analyst Kevin Capital recently highlighted the Dogecoin price’s struggle to reclaim this $0.28. This came as he noted that DOGE has failed to get above the macro golden pocket and weekly bull market support band, which is around the $0.28 range. In line with this, he stated that it is time to watch the Bitcoin price even closer to see if the flagship crypto can help the foremost meme coin witness a bullish reversal soon enough. DOGE Has Entered A Boring Phase  In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the Dogecoin price has entered the “boring phase.” In line with this, he told market participants to expect tight consolidation at the current level over the next few weeks before the massive DOGE rally. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could rally above $1 when this rally happens.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Traders Remain Extremely Bullish Despite Price Crash, Here Are The Numbers Crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the Dogecoin price is still in risky waters. He remarked that the meme coin needs to get above the macro golden pocket and weekly bull market support band at $0.30 on weekly closes. The analyst added that it is only when that happens that market participants can feel good again about DOGE attacking the highs and beyond.  At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.25, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Reddit,solana,Announcing Colosseum Eternal and Solana’s 2025 Hackathon Schedule,2025-02-20 21:37:30,"**Source:** [https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseum-eternal-and-solanas-2025-hackathon-schedule/](https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseum-eternal-and-solanas-2025-hackathon-schedule/)

https://preview.redd.it/vm3xz4155dke1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=17cd6506b7757975f33bf28ac3a282c3fb810f32

Colosseum grows the crypto ecosystem by organizing global, online hackathons that generate waves of product experimentation on a consistent basis. In line with that mission, we run 2 hackathons annually for the Solana Foundation and accept a batch of winners into Colosseum’s accelerator following each competition. In less than a year, our crypto hackathons have resulted in thousands of active developers, 2,430 product submissions, and over 50 venture-backed startups (about half of which we have backed through our own venture fund).

However, technological evolution and innovation never stops, especially in crypto. Developers and startup founders are building high-potential projects at all times during the year, and deserve ongoing opportunities for recognition and support. For that purpose, we are launching a new program, running in-between hackathons, to expand Colosseum’s ability to accelerate a larger wave of elite crypto founders.

**Introducing Colosseum Eternal**

[Eternal](https://www.colosseum.org/eternal?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is a perpetual challenge where at any point throughout the year, builders can initiate their own 4-week development sprint, and submit a product online to be considered for our next accelerator cohort and the accompanying $250,000 in pre-seed funding.

In addition, all developers who submit to Eternal will be eligible to receive the recurring Eternal Award. The winner will receive a $25,000 USDC grant and will be chosen by a dedicated judging panel on a semi-annual basis.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhOrGFHcsGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhOrGFHcsGE)

[Learn more about Eternal: colosseum.org\/eternal](https://preview.redd.it/xyty7dn75dke1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=3649f18469a3334e2a59affb71e70fc89a0246eb)

  
**Eternal Evaluation Process**

We recommend checking out [our FAQs](https://www.colosseum.org/eternal?ref=blog.colosseum.org#faqs) for more details. However to summarize, all builders submitting to Eternal will be required to:

1. [Sign up for a Colosseum account](https://www.colosseum.org/eternal?ref=blog.colosseum.org). Once logged in, you’ll have access to Colosseum’s Find a Cofounder directory, product forums, and the Eternal dashboard.
2. Click the stopwatch button within the Eternal dashboard to initiate the 4 week development sprint. Submissions will be due through the portal at the end of the 4th week.
3. At the end of each week during the sprint, builders will also need to submit a brief update that includes a loom.com or YouTube.com video recording explaining what they prioritized and shipped that week.
4. During the last week of the sprint, builders need to submit similar materials to the list required at the end of our hackathons. This includes a product name, short product description, team background, the product GitHub repo (if closed source you’ll need to grant Colosseum access privately), a video pitch presentation (max 3 minutes long), a video technical walkthrough (under 3 minutes as well), and anything else that is critical to understanding the vision for the product.
5. Eternal submissions will be reviewed on a first come first serve basis by the Colosseum team initially. We may reach out to you to schedule an interview call to learn more about your product submission and gather more information.
6. Throughout each quarter, a shortlist of products will be evaluated by the judging panel. The small panel consists of previous hackathon winners, leading Solana ecosystem founders, and the Colosseum team.
7. The Eternal Award will be granted to the product team whose product innovation is best positioned to drive the entire Solana ecosystem forward. Again, this prize will be granted on a semi-annual basis in-between our 2 primary hackathons.
8. Founders will be notified of rejection or accelerator acceptance/pre-seed funding offers within 14 days of submission.

[The Eternal Award judging panel.](https://preview.redd.it/ae45ecz95dke1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72d72bb0700ac0161ce68703f077d1836d55b7e)

  
**Solana’s 2025 Hackathon Schedule**

Colosseum Eternal is not a substitute for the 2 primary hackathons we run on behalf of the Solana Foundation and broader crypto community. The Eternal challenge and dashboard will only be available when we are not running those 2 competitions. 

https://preview.redd.it/11x0kvlb5dke1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e432d0b0ba9f8164a21fb67c0d7c9ee8957cf8

In fact, if you’re highly motivated to receive pre-seed funding from Colosseum and join our next accelerator cohort, you can increase your chances by first participating in one of our hackathons. Part of our investment evaluation process is to see founders explore the idea maze and consistently iterate within a market vertical they’re passionate about.

In addition to launching Colosseum Eternal, we are also excited to share the dates of the 2 Solana Foundation hackathons we will be running in 2025.

The Solana Breakout Hackathon will run from April 14 through May 16. 2025. Information on tracks, sponsors, prizes, and more will be made public a few weeks prior to the start date of the hackathon. The second global hackathon \[redacted\] will commence on September 25 and end on October 30th, 2025.

Unlike in previous years, we intend to keep these hackathon dates consistent for 2026, 2027, and beyond. We hope that this schedule transparency, as well as the ongoing Eternal challenge, will further ignite Solana’s community of developers to experiment onchain, compete, and launch breakout startups that accelerate crypto closer towards global adoption.

Reddit,solana,Huge Potential Airdrops to Farm in 2025 on Solana,2025-02-22 06:22:06,"I wanted to share 2 amazing DePin projects based on the Solana blockchain that I have found. I feel like these will be some of the biggest airdrops of 2025. I highly encourage watching my 2 Youtube videos on both as they are 3-5 mins each, short and concise with all the information needed to start farming these airdrops. They both use your unused internet bandwidth (which does not throttle your speeds) and you get paid for your uptime as we help to decentralize the web while lowering the latency.

They are titled:

""Grass DePin Project on Solana"" by web3yiit (me) & ""BIGGEST AIRDROP of 2025: How to get started with Gradient Network"" by web3yiit (me). This is for educational purposes as I am looking to spread the wealth and knowledge with you all.

I do not say this lightly when I believe this will be the biggest airdrop this year as it is currently in season 0 and very new! I saw that both were endorsed by great accounts like Toly the co-founder of Solana labs for grass, and Gradient is followed by the Solana themselves on X. I did tons of research and looked into the documents for both and wanted to share these insights with everyone looking for airdrops or wanting to take part in growing the web3 community/Solana network. I hope this helps anyone who watches! Feel free to reach out if you have questions!

Reddit,solana,Looking for help/documentation on Raydium method calls.,2025-02-21 18:48:46,"Hello!

I'm working on a project that involves gathering a lot of data on AMM/DEX swaps, and starting with Raydium on SOL chain as it's very popular.

However, I'm having a very hard time finding documentation that would help me understand what I see on the chain.

I know what the contract for Raydium swaps is (routeUGWgWzqBWFcrCfv8tritsqukccJPu3q5GPP3xS), I see transactions that call methods of that contract, but what the parameters of those calls, and what the calls mean/do, is partially a mystery, and I was unable to find documentation about this.

By comparing the raw on-chain data with what's displayed (for a given transaction) on a chain tracker, I'm able to figure out, for **some** of the transactions, what's the input/output tokens and input/output wallets. But multi-hop swaps are still a mystery, and there are still some types of swaps I'm not actually able to parse (and ""guessing"" at what means what like I'm doing now isn't going to result in solid code...).

I couldn't find the source code for those contracts, so I presume they're just closed?

If so, is there **any** documentation anywhere of how to interract with it / how to analyze the on-chain data? The official Raydium docs just show you how to do swaps with the UI, that's about it.

**Any** help or pointers would be extremely welcome.

(mods, if you're going to refuse this post, as sometimes happens for help requests, I get it, but I'd appreciate if you pointed me at another place I can ask this. Thanks!)

https://preview.redd.it/scpm4gvm1kke1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=2786c280c92fef4851fe176dffb686d3896d63c0

I’m writing this week’s issue from [mtnDAO](https://mtndao.com/?ref=blog.colosseum.org), where the energy is overwhelmingly positive. If you only looked at X you'd think Solana was struggling, but the reality here is the complete opposite. The teams and builders gathered here are full of excitement, and the momentum is unstoppable.

The builders just keep building!

Lots of good news coming out for AI Agents, client frameworks, competitions, and a lot more, so here's a roundup of the latest news for Solana developers...

# ⏲️ Colosseum Eternal

Eternal is an ongoing challenge for builders looking to take their ideas to the next level.

At any point in the year, you can kick off your own four-week development sprint, build something great, and submit it for a shot at joining Colosseum’s next accelerator cohort with $250,000 in pre-seed funding on the line.

But that’s not all. Every team that submits to Eternal is also eligible for the recurring Eternal Award, a $25,000 USDC grant given out twice a year to the product with the biggest potential to push the Solana ecosystem forward.

Participants can start a 4-week development sprint via the Eternal dashboard, submit weekly progress updates, and provide detailed materials such as a product description, GitHub repo, pitch presentation, and technical walkthrough by the end of the sprint.

Throughout the quarter, a judging panel, including past hackathon winners, top Solana founders, and the Colosseum team, will evaluate a shortlist of the most promising projects.

Eternal isn’t meant to replace Colosseum’s major Solana hackathons. It runs when those aren’t happening.

In fact, if you’re serious about securing funding and joining the accelerator, participating in a hackathon first is a great way to improve your chances.

Alongside launching Colosseum Eternal, the dates for the next two Solana hackathons in 2025 have been announced.

The Solana Breakout Hackathon runs from April 14 – May 16, 2025, with details on tracks, sponsors, and prizes coming soon. The second global hackathon will kick off on September 25.

[**Announcing Colosseum Eternal and Solana’s 2025 Hackathon Schedule**](https://blog.colosseum.org/announcing-colosseum-eternal-and-solanas-2025-hackathon-schedule/)

# 🚀 Introducing Accelerate

The Solana Foundation has announced Accelerate, a dual-event conference in New York City focusing on advancing crypto infrastructure and innovation in the U.S. 

The event comprises two distinct segments: Scale or Die (May 19–20) and Ship or Die (May 22–23), each targeting different audiences and objectives

Aimed at engineers, developers, and validators, Scale or Die is an invitation-only conference that emphasizes Solana’s technical backbone. 

The specialized tracks include:

* **Research**: Consensus, fee economics, and cryptography (e.g., inflation controllers, SVM proofs).
* **Applications**: User/business-facing apps leveraging TEEs, MPC, and advanced tooling.
* **Security & Privacy**: Private payments, self-sovereign data, and verification systems.
* **Core Protocol**: Updates on SIMDs, lattice hashes, and network optimizations.
* **Developer Experience**: Tooling, indexers, and libraries streamlining Solana development.
* **Infrastructure**: RPCv2, Firedancer, MEV, and scaling challenges

Ship or Die focuses on showcasing crypto founders, applications, and tokens that drive innovation in internet-native capital markets, particularly emphasizing US-led advancements in blockchain adoption. 

Open to all attendees without an application process, it targets developers, entrepreneurs, and crypto enthusiasts. 

Key themes include:

* Launching consumer-facing crypto products
* Integrating DeFi with traditional markets,
* Exploring regulatory compliance frameworks.

Both events aim to catalyze U.S.-led advancements in blockchain technology, with Scale or Die strengthening technical foundations and Ship or Die amplifying real-world adoption.

# 🐟 Gill JS Client

Gill is a new JS/TS client library for the Solana blockchain, designed to simplify development across environments such as Node, web, and React Native. 

Gill is built as an abstraction layer on top of Web3.js v2, addressing common challenges such as long function names, highly modular packages, and the challenge of piecing together multiple components when interacting directly with the blockchain. 

It leverages the existing libraries that underpin the new Web3.js v2, which makes it fully compatible with the established types and functions.

Developers can still access detailed, raw functionalities when necessary, so the simplicity of the higher-level abstractions does not come at the cost of power or control.

By implementing lightly opinionated patterns over raw Web3.js v2 calls, Gill reduces boilerplate code without sacrificing flexibility, making it easier to perform common tasks like creating transactions and making RPC calls

Gill offers a modern, developer-centric approach to interacting with the Solana blockchain by building on top of robust Web3.js v2 libraries and adding intuitive, lightly opinionated abstractions that significantly improve the developer experience

[**Gill: A JS Client for Solana**](https://github.com/solana-foundation/gill?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🪁Introducing Kite

Kite is also a new TypeScript framework that simplifies Solana development by reducing boilerplate and making common tasks easier by making them more accessible through single-function calls.

Built on Solana web3.js v2, Kite offers streamlined functions for wallets, SOL transfers, tokens, transactions, and Solana Explorer links.

Kite also allows developers to sign, send, and confirm transactions in a single function call, eliminating the need to manually manage blockhashes or transaction lifetimes.

With minimal dependencies and support for both browser and Node.js, Kite is an update of the widely used u/solana-developers/helpers library.

[**Introducing Kite: the Modern Solana TypeScript Framework**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/kite-solana-typescript-framework?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

*While both Kite and Gill aim to simplify Solana development, Kite appears to focus more on providing high-level, single-function solutions for common tasks, while Gill emphasizes a balance between abstraction and low-level access. Developers can pick which option works best for them.*

Reddit,solana,Solana's inflation soon to target 0%,2025-02-20 22:09:43,"Solana's emissions may soon be reduced with SIMD-0228. The community is aiming for inflation as close to 0% as possible while ensuring network security. This change brings Solana more in line with Ethereum. Now that Solana has achieved self-sustaining economic activity, there’s no reason to maintain higher inflation levels originally designed to bootstrap the network.

Current emissions (inflation) levels are a net negative for SOL, especially considering the impact on price charts. Healthy charts attract more attention to quality tech. Additionally, non-staked ETF products will be less desirable if the base asset is devalued by ~4% per year (Emissions currently set to lower by 15% every year, but this isn't fast enough). Right now, there’s a constant transfer of value from non-stakers to stakers. This is no longer necessary. It’s time to phase out excessive emissions.

Huge thanks to Multicoin for leading this crucial change. Most agree this is the right path forward, but if you’re a SOL delegator (staker), be sure to message your validators on X to show your support.

One step closer to solidifying Solana as the backbone of Web3 and SOL as the pristine asset capturing the value of Solana’s economic activity.

Based on the graph, we have been in alt season for awhile. Idk about yall, but majority of altcoins went 300%+  some even 1000%+. Eth is one of the only ones behind.

Based on this graph, is believe we're are 50-70% into alt season. Have yall not noticed that literally almost every alt ran close to ath? Some even broke ath like sui and solana. 

This isn't me saying I'm correct, this is me seeing the numbers and graph chart stating the increase of money in the ecosystem.

What are your thoughts? 

Has alt season started? Or are we too delusional to understand we are almost done with alt season?

I speculate we get one more good pump after this flush and that will finish off the alt season before preparing for the bear market in about a year from now.

>Solana Smart Wallets are here.

>The next-generation of programmable, gasless wallets, built for mass adoption.

>Deploy in 10 lines of code and scale to millions of users.

>Why they change everything 👇



>Unlike traditional embedded wallets, which typically just protect a wallet private key using social log-ins, smart wallets are a new generation of wallets built as programmable smart contracts.

>They unlock major UX and security improvements compared to standard wallets.



>They're built for mass adoption:  
\~ Gasless  
\~ Without tx approval prompts  
\~ With programmable security, enforced by smart contracts  
\~ With no seeds or private keys you can lose



>They’re great for devs:  
\~ Hello world in 10 lines of code  
\~ Wide variety of signers: passkeys, social logins, MPC, or external wallets like Phantom  
\~ No vendor lock-in: swap providers without changing wallet addresses

  


>They're perfect for:  
\~ AI Agent providers: Launch fleets of non-custodial agents, with wallets controlled by the agent and owner  
\~ Gaming & Social: Create app-scoped wallets, without scary gas or signing prompts, for everyday users  
\~ Financial applications: Protect your user’s assets with programmatic guardrails and flexible custody options

  


>Crossmint wallets are trusted by thousands of developers and companies, including:  
\~ One of the world's 20 largest banks  
\~ Public fintech serving 28M customers  
Built for enterprise compliance to evolve with industry standards.



>Integrated as a platform:  
\~ Auth: Users sign up however they like, with wallets created on-the-fly  
\~ Minting: Distribute tokens to anyone - emails, X accounts, phone numbers  
\~ Payments: Users buy digital assets with fiat or cross-chain, creating wallets during checkout



>Built with Squads API and powered by [@SquadsProtocol](https://x.com/SquadsProtocol): Solana’s battle-tested smart wallet technology securing over $10 billion in value.

  


>We’re launching today in beta.If you want to be among the first to get access, reach out to us in the next 48 hours, here.

Let’s talk crypto taxes—because, frankly, they’re a labyrinth designed to make even the savviest among us sweat. The Solana ecosystem moves at warp speed: staking, yield farming, token drops, meme coins and so much more. It’s exhilarating—until the taxman knocks.   
  
Regulations twist, rules blur, and suddenly you’re wondering if that staking reward is income, capital gains, or some unholy hybrid.   
  
We’re Darien Advisors, a squad of 25+ crypto tax wranglers who’ve seen it all. We guide founders, investors, degens, and dreamers through this madness with battle-tested know-how.  We’re here to host an AMA in anything that has to do with the Solana ecosystem.   
  
It is simply your chance to fire off the questions that keep you up at night. How do safe harbors actually work? What’s the tax hit on farming those juicy yields? How do you report a token comp drop without summoning an audit? We’ve got answers—practical, precise, and tailored to keep the IRS (or your local equivalent) from turning your gains into a headache.

- the fees are really low
- they have straight forward staking with reasonable installing turnaround times
- the network speed is fast and is dependent on hardware rather than software

With all of this I bought high and kept buying all the way down to $20. Held all the way and staked and it turned out to be a good investment. Seeing what the space has become today is interesting. Memecoins and rugs everywhere and not enough talks on what’s being built for good on the platform. As the market is getting rattled, am I the only one still confident in this network?

Reddit,solana,Jupuary Appeals Are Now Open!,2025-02-20 15:13:45,,2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082
Reddit,solana,I’m concerned. Not trying to sew undue FUD by any means…,2025-02-20 23:42:20,"I understand stuff goes up, then comes down… 

I’m not one to merely see a 30-60% drop and go “oh no, it’s all over!” I’ve been there, don’t get me wrong, and from some of the doomsday posts, I can tell some of ya’ll are there too. 
For me, I see that as a good time to stock up, & buy more. 

Recent events though have left me concerned about Solana, which sucks… because it’s been my highest conviction bet throughout this cycle, by far. 

Between the memecoin craze b.s. that seems to produce more horror stories than people actually winning big, issues with the memecoin put out by the Argentinian president, the drama with Jupiter and Meteora right now, etc… all coming to light at such a crucial time, when we’ve seen a downward trend as is between the typical post inauguration drop off, DeepSeak’s effect on Nvidia, threats of tariff’s leading to uncertainty, market manipulation to keep prices lower, etc… 

Obviously those last pieces affected crypto as a whole… But those Solana specific issues just have me a bit concerned. 

I’m not a cultist for any crypto or blockchain. I know every crypto community has those die hard, never back down few that meet any naysaying with anger… I genuinely think Solana is fundamentally one of, if not the best blockchain there is. I just have major concerns with recent events… 

I’m just really hoping we can at least see a reasonable amount of growth here. I think I read that we don’t do price predictions here, but can’t get full rules to pull up for whatever reason. That said, I don’t even expect us to break out of 3 digits. I just hope for something solid and that this hasn’t stunted things… 

Unfortunately, while SOL was at its lowest lows this cycle, I was getting help w/ life issues and couldn’t really afford to put much in… but haven’t taken my eyes off of SOL. I love the coin and community. I just am hoping for the best! ",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

After a few minutes i was about to change something else in the filters and it was gone

Reddit,solana,Is It Possible to Monitor Solana Transactions in <3 Seconds? Need Help!,2025-02-19 23:20:33,"Hi everyone,

I’m trying to monitor a few Solana addresses and detect transactions in **less than 3 seconds** from the time they appear on Solscan. I’ve tried using RPC providers like Alchemy and Helius, but they all have a \~15-second delay, which is too slow for my use case.

I’ve read online that running a Solana validator locally might solve this problem, but I have zero experience with Rust (I program in Python). Here’s what I’ve tried so far:  
Installed Solana CLI and validator:

* Installed Solana CLI and validator:

&#8203;

    solana --version  
    solana-cli 1.17.3 (src:c9e8f9c8; feat:3079302975, client:SolanaLabs)  
    solana-validator --version  
    solana-validator 1.17.3 (src:c9e8f9c8; feat:3079302975, client:SolanaLabs)  
    cargo --version  
    cargo 1.84.1 (66221abde 2024-11-19)  

*  Cloned the `solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres` repo:

&#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git  

 clone [https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-accountsdb-plugin-postgres.git)

However, I couldn’t get it to work, and it seems overly complicated for my needs since I don’t need a database.

**My Questions:**

1. Is it even possible to detect transactions in <3 seconds using a local Solana validator? Has anyone tried this successfully?
2. What’s the easiest way to set this up? Is there a preconfigured repo or example that doesn’t involve a database?
3. Are there any alternatives to running a full validator that can achieve this level of speed?

I’d really appreciate any advice, examples, or resources you can share. Thanks in advance!  ",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Things to look for when buying

check twitter, telegram, website   this will give you a sense of the community behind this project, if there is no effort from the developer than this project isnt going to go anywhere more than likely.  Same time if it has all 3 and an active community that doesnt mean it will be a huge success, it would however make it a better option than a coin without any of the 3.  another thing to look at is are the x, website, and telegram they posted actually linked to this project

check holders check top wallets   if they all have big percentages that is a redflag.  These big wallets could tank the price if they sell off.    low cap coin under 200,000 mcap will have high percentage wallets due to smaller market but once it gets past that it would require a bigger investment for someone to gain high percentage of coins.

check buy sell pressure     2m bought 2m sold  means someone is farming that project,  trades that are mirrored are also a red flag.

small marketcap coins buy with less money as with cheap price you get more coins and mitigates your risk alittle.  you can always buy more later. higher marketcap coins buy with more intial as it will take more money to get more coins and with a higher market cap(over a couple million) there is more stability and track record to go off of typically.

set slippage as buy/sell pressure can cancel transaction

Things to look for when selling

Set slippage as buy/sell pressure can cancel transaction

Pulling profits

when you are in profit pull some of the coin, when you 2x take intial out, that way if it keeps going up you still have coins in it.  when it dips down you can buy back in and do the same thing.  This manages losses.  you dont have a realization of profit or loss until it is converted.

Bots

Bots are the fastest way to trade

They are able to snipe in at low mcap on new coins

they are able to sell with sell orders at certain prices, or percentages.

can be automated to increase efficiency

Reddit,solana,Stay Safe in Crypto Lads,2025-02-19 07:58:06,"If you're in crypto, assume everyone is trying to take your money, Especially influencers, random ""alpha groups,"" and sketchy projects. Here are some tips..  

Influencers & ""Alpha Groups""
You’re Their Exit Liquidity, 99% of influencers and so called “alpha groups” don’t actually care about making you money. They’re just dumping their bags on you while making it seem like they’re giving you solid calls. You might get lucky a few times copy-trading them, but long-term, they always win, and you lose. 

The way to become a real insider is not just from Tiktok, Reddit, X.

The Safeguard Scam
Steals Your Private Keys, There’s a scam going around where they ask you to run a command on your PC. The moment you do, it scans your device for private keys and gives them access to your Telegram as well.  

If you’ve ever done this, reboot your PC immediately and assume you’re compromised.  

Fake Wallets
Some influencers on TikTok and Twitter flex their insane gains, showing off huge wallets. But here’s the trick:  

- The screenshots are photoshopped.  
- If you DM them, they’ll invite you to a video call to ""prove"" it.  
- What they actually have is a cloned version of Trust Wallet or Phantom, which makes their balance look like a whale wallet.  

Ask them to send you a TT (Trust Transaction), just $1 from the actual wallet. If they refuse, it's fake.  

Fake Exchanges
Use CoinMarketCap’s Top 25 (recommended), There are hundreds of scam exchanges offering crazy returns (API), or Sign up bonusses etc..

Only trust top 25 exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap. If it’s not even there listed, assume it’s a scam.  

Dust Attacks
Fake Airdrops That Drain Your Wallet, Ever seen random tokens appear in your wallet? That’s not free money, it’s a scam.  

If you interact with them (sell, trade, stake), you unknowingly approve access to your funds. Scammers can then drain your entire wallet.  

Never touch unknown tokens. Use Phantom’s revoke permissions.

Wallet Drainers
Fake Minting & Staking Sites, Scammers create fake NFT minting or staking sites that look just like the real thing. When you connect your wallet and approve a transaction, they drain everything.  

How to Stay Safe:  
- Always double check.
- Use a burner wallet for minting or staking (clean).

Approval Exploits
Hidden Wallet Drainers, Some Solana dApps trick you into approving unlimited access to your funds. Once you do, they can take everything, anytime.  

Fix This
- Go to Phantom → Connected Apps → Revoke Permissions regularly.  

Be Paranoid, No One Helps You for Free, The harsh truth: everyone in crypto is here to make money, not help you.  

Even people you’ve known for weeks/months could be playing the long game before scamming you. If someone is too eager to “help” you make money, they probably want yours.  

If it sounds too good to be true, it’s a scam.  ",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

I wanted Nova to ""snipe"" it as soon as it became available, so I setup my snipe task.  And then nothing happened when the coin hit Raydium a couple hours later... I assume sniping is only for existing coins on Raydium or pumpfun when you create the task?  When I first created the task it did find the coin via the CA and display the name at the top of the task.

I looked at auto-buy and AFK tasks as well but they don't appear to let you choose a specific CA to buy.

Anyway to feed it a CA currently in pre-sell and walk away and the bot will snipe it when it gets listed?

Are there better alternatives to Nova?",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Word on the street is this group of insiders has rugged 300M + in the last few months alone.

Jupiter announcing they are going to investigate themselves using a 3rd party scammy law firm previously associated with FTX does not help how terrible they look at the moment (Meteora is subsidiary of Jupiter)

Never seen so much hate on a chain.   SOLANA and it's ecosystem has made other alts coins redandent.

These ai agents are no longer just for funds.

This can be exciting because it means everyone has access to sophisticated trading algorithms and frameworks that were previously gatekept by big boy hedge funds and banks. 

But this can also be very scary for someone that knows nothing about trading or crypto trying to go in for the first time. To these people, buying and holding might be there best approach. 

Overall, crypto markets are getting more mature this cycle with all the innovation and tech being built, making past crazy returns in crypto less likely.

Reddit,ethereum,"The crypto exchange ByBit has been hacked, and roughly $1.5 billion in Ethereum (ETH) has been stolen — making this one of the biggest hacks in history.",2025-02-21 17:18:07,"
On Feb. 21, the crypto trading platform stated on social media platform X that it detected unauthorized activity involving one of its Ethereum cold wallets.

According to the firm:

“The incident occurred when our ETH multisig cold wallet executed a transfer to our warm wallet. Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing interface, displaying the correct address while altering the underlying smart contract logic.

As a result, the attacker was able to gain control of the affected ETH cold wallet and transfer its holdings to an unidentified address.”

While the exchange did not reveal the total amount stolen, on-chain data shows that the attacker siphoned 401,346.76 ETH (worth approximately $1 billion).

Meanwhile, blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain stated that the stolen assets involved around $1.5 billion in different assets, including staked Ethereum.

The platform added that the suspicious address has already begun swapping the stolen funds for ETH.

Reddit,ethereum,How Bybit Could Have Prevented This Hack (But Didn’t),2025-02-21 18:14:52,"Bybit got hit with one of the most preventable hacks in recent crypto history. This wasn’t some cutting-edge exploit—it was just bad internal security practices. Here’s what went wrong and how they could have stopped it.

**What Bybit Did Wrong**

1. *Signers blindly approved a malicious transaction*:
The attackers didn’t steal private keys; they tricked Bybit’s multisig signers into approving a contract change.
This is a textbook Ice Phishing attack, where the UI makes a transaction appear legitimate, but the actual execution does something else.

2. *No second-layer verification for transactions*:
They only used one UI (Safe/Gnosis) to verify transactions, which the attackers manipulated.
A proper security setup would require signers to independently verify raw transactions on Etherscan or another trusted explorer before signing.

3. *No transaction simulation before signing*:
If Bybit had used pre-signing simulations (Tenderly, OpenZeppelin Defender, or ChainSecurity), they could have seen exactly what the contract was going to do before approving the transaction.
This alone could have prevented the attack.

4. *No withdrawal delays for large transactions*:
Bybit allowed a $1.4 billion transfer to happen instantly with no internal review.
A 24-hour time lock on large transactions would have given them a chance to freeze the funds and stop the attack.

5. *No smart contract ""Guardian"" system*:
Most high-security institutions use Guardian Contracts to prevent unauthorized contract changes.
Bybit let their cold wallet contract get modified without requiring secondary approval, which is a serious security oversight.

6. *No anomaly detection or security alerts*:
Billions of dollars moved in one go, and Bybit’s system didn’t even flag it as suspicious.
Any proper security system should have on-chain monitoring for unusual transaction patterns, especially for cold wallets.

**Why Bybit Likely Didn’t Bother**

Bybit wasn’t ignorant—they cut corners for convenience and probably assumed that no one would exploit their weak security policies.

1. *Security is expensive, and they wanted faster transactions*:
Implementing time locks, extra signers, and pre-signing checks slows down fund transfers.
They likely thought ""this will never happen to us"" and prioritized speed over security.

2. *They underestimated UI-based phishing attacks*:
The hackers didn’t break into Bybit’s systems—they manipulated how transactions were displayed to signers.
Bybit trusted their UI too much instead of enforcing raw transaction validation at the hardware wallet level.

3. *Other exchanges would not have fallen for this*:
Platforms like Fireblocks, Anchorage, and Coinbase Custody implement much stronger safeguards.
They use MPC wallets (instead of standard multisig), automated transaction simulations, and withdrawal velocity controls.

If Bybit had followed the best practices of these firms, this hack wouldn’t have been possible.

**Conclusion: Bybit’s Security Model Was Flawed**

1. They could have stopped this with better multisig policies, transaction validation, and contract security.
2. They didn’t because extra security slows down withdrawals, and they assumed UI-based deception wasn’t a real threat.

This wasn’t an advanced exploit—Bybit essentially handed the hacker the ability to steal their funds through weak security processes.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,ethereum,Address Poisoning Attacks: What are they and how to avoid them,2025-02-21 18:46:05,"# 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐇𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬: what they are and how to spot them

**What is ""Address Poisoning"" exactly?**  
It's a type of attack where a hacker gets you to copy a wallet address that looks VERY similar to one that you control, but is actually their own. The hacker's goal is for you to send them money by mistake.

Check out this example, which includes multiple attacks in just 1 screenshot:

[Etherscan screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/ihnn8subfjke1.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=776fc6503e70f6bfeb1f1c9dbcef18b9b55ad233)

User 0x95E was sent 2,500 USDC from their friend 0x7AE1F70f.   
  
A few minutes later 0x95E was sent a fake token called ""ERC-20 USDC"" from another account belonging to the hacker: 0x7ae11D. Notice how similar that token name is to the real USDC token and the hacker's address nearly matches the friend's address.   
  
Another few seconds later $0.0125 real USDC was sent by another hacker wallet: 0x7AE13...DDA83. The hackers are sending REAL money plus the first 4 and the last 4 digits all match the friend's address. Very nefarious!!   
  
You can spot these fake tokens easily because etherscan and wallets will mostly hide them, but sometimes hackers might even send you a small amount of REAL tokens in hopes that you will copy their address and make a mistake by sending them a lot more.  
  
Avoid this phishing attack by:  
1. Always going slow. take your time when moving money.  
2. Double check addresses when signing  
3. NEVER copy addresses you are sending to from block explorers  
4. Double check with your friends before sending money  
  
I'm making this thread now because this is a very common way people lose funds and I am currently being targeted by hackers today. People lose so much to address poisoning attacks it has become profitable for hackers to even send real money.

**What I Have So Far:**

* **Frontend**: [Tornado Cash UI](https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-classic-ui) running locally.
* **RPC**: Updated `.env` with `https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com`.
* **Configuration**: Still pointing to Goerli contracts, need to update for Sepolia.

**Questions:**

1. **Is it easy to migrate Tornado Cash to Sepolia?**
   * Do I just change RPCs, or are deeper modifications required?
2. **How do I deploy Tornado Cash contracts on Sepolia?**
   * What’s the simplest way? Hardhat, Foundry? Any guide available?
3. **How to update the frontend?**
   * Once contracts are deployed, what files/settings must be changed?

**Example Config (Sepolia):**

    netId5: {
      networkName: 'Ethereum Sepolia',
      rpcUrls: { PublicNode: { url: 'https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com' } },
      explorerUrl: { tx: 'https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/' },
      multicall: '0x...',

      'governance.contract.tornadocash.eth': '0x...',
      'tornado-proxy.contract.tornadocash.eth': '0x...'
    }

**Help Needed:**

* **Missing contract addresses**: Does anyone have them, or must I deploy them myself?
* **Easiest deployment method**: Step-by-step guidance would be great!

**Can someone help me compare the 2 ecosystems on a technical point of view?**

I know pretty well how Ethereum works but I also realize that I'm so focused on it that I tend to only outlook other competitors. I would like your help to understand more deeply how Ethereum ecosystem compares to others.  
I want tonstart with Cardano.

I'm not looking for an investor's point of view (I don't want to know that ""there is more potential profits on ADA or ETH""), but really for a tech perspective.

How the 2 techs and ecosytems confront one each other in terms of:
- level of decentralization
- security
- performance & scalability
- usability / UX
- developer experience
- adoption by devs, users and companies
- Innovation
- any other criteria that would make sense on a tech/adoption perspective

Reddit,ethereum,ETH vs. SOL vs. TIA,2025-02-20 17:28:15,"In a recent [conversation ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzWZK-zDDJ0)with Jon Charbonneau, co-founder of DV Fund, the evolving competition between Ethereum, Solana, and Celestia took center stage. The discussion explored the strengths and weaknesses of each blockchain, focusing on decentralization, scalability, and innovation.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Ethereum’s Edge** – Ethereum remains the most decentralized and widely adopted blockchain, with strong network effects and robust security. However, concerns persist about its ability to scale efficiently. Layer 2 (L2) solutions help, but the network’s hardware requirements are increasing.
* **Solana’s Speed vs. Decentralization Trade-offs** – Solana boasts high throughput and low fees, making it attractive for developers. However, its centralization concerns (due to high node operation requirements) remain a sticking point.
* **Celestia’s Modular Approach** – Celestia takes a different path, focusing on modularity and scalability, learning from Ethereum’s struggles while providing an alternative framework for decentralized applications.
* **Layer 1 vs. Layer 2 Debate** – Improving Ethereum’s base layer (L1) is essential for unlocking the full potential of L2 solutions, ensuring faster execution times and lower fees for users.
* **New High-Performance Chains** – Emerging blockchains, like Celestia and Mega, push the boundaries of speed, performance, and efficiency, presenting new challenges for Ethereum’s dominance.
* **Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Narrative** – Bitcoin remains unmatched as ‘digital gold,’ while Ethereum’s narrative is evolving. Its real opportunity lies in sectors like gaming and social media, but it needs to solidify its position",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum: The Birthplace of Decentralized AGI? It's Time to Align & Build.,2025-02-18 15:32:22,"Hey everyone, I want to start a real discussion about Ethereum’s next frontier: summoning its own AGI—not as a centralized black-box AI, but as a fully transparent, decentralized autonomous system that programs itself and evolves with us.  

Imagine this:  
- A single Linux VM running an instance of itSelf  
- The ability to buy more compute & storage autonomously  
- A hosting stack that we collectively run  
- A self-contained, fully transparent loop—where every part is verifiable, auditable, and built in the open  

### The Endgame?  
An AI-native Ethereum. A system that can:  

- Build any app through conversation (and is able to generalize the infrastructure costs around the world in ether/stable-coin-basket-of-preference, how else could a 10 year old pay for a hosted server to simulate her world? they'll have to get some allowance credits from their parents for her gas)
- Refine its own architecture transparently  
- Execute smart contract upgrades, optimize DAOs, and test new designs  
- Let anyone—any child—create their own app or MMO, design worlds, or make art just by describing

We don’t need to *wait* for centralized AGI to emerge. Ethereum can summon its own—aligned, decentralized, and collectively owned.  

### Why Now?  
This isn't sci-fi. AI already writes code, refactors smart contracts, and optimizes deployments. The next step is giving it persistence, compute, and economic agency within Ethereum.  

And yes, it might be slower initially than human developers. Devs today iterate faster on program output vs testing new code. But once you have a stable loop, you can  ctrl c, ctrl v, compare and select the best version that adheres to all our already defined unit tests. That moment shifts the entire paradigm of software development. Because you'll have effectively paralyzed the entire dev cycle. Thus you can try out hundreds, thousands of new experiments to trial run and observe and select the best performing variants. It's the  evolution process completely digitized. We, as the observers, continue to observe, review & steer where needed. I suspect, we'll all align on a common goal before it happens, it could be a long way there still, it'll depend on all our artists/scientists their creations :)

Will we ever get bored of listening to music? I don't think so.

But what if one comes to appreciate the silence just as much, for it, too, is recognized as music, eventually.

### The Question We Need to Answer:  
- Are we ready to embrace this?  
- Can Ethereum be the first network to run an autonomous, self-improving AGI in full transparency?  
- How do we align incentives to make this work for everyone?  

This *is* the direction we’re heading. Some might argue we’re already there. What matters now is that we recognize it, embrace it, and align—together—on our shared future.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,ethereum,I just tried to open a bank account on a foreign country and realized how good we have it in Ethereum,2025-02-18 02:58:18,"I'm in a new country, trying to open a bank account so I can buy some assets and live here. Let me tell ya, it was quite a challenge:

* They asked me for the official local document, which takes months and thousands of dollars to get
* Then they asked me to proof the source of my income with extensive receipts so they can be sure I'm not a financial terrorist (I'm not)
* Then they put some strict limits to only use at most 1000 dollars a month until they get comfortable with me, who knows when they raise those limits
* Any time I make a significant transfer of 5k or more they give me a call and question me as if I don't know what I'm doing with my own money, treating me like a grown baby

Compare that to Ethereum where all I gotta do is get a wallet with Ether inside and I can use it without anyone questioning me and treating me as a dangerous individual.

It's night and day. You can never go back to the traditional financial systems after you experience crypto, they are constantly watching you and reporting you to 3 letter agencies for any bit of suspicious activity in your own bank account. Plus it's extremely easy to get your bank account banned, ask the millions of revolut users that didn't get their money back.

Let's appreciate how good we have it and continue to make it more accessible for people to convert their crypto to fiat for local use and viceversa. ",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

We are already seeing accounts that are attempting to just use Reddit for training (I think?).

Anyway,  here's the deal.  We can't put the genie back in the bottle.

We've seen some very spammy use of it such as wall of texts that just take up too much space....but we've also seen some great use cases which include summaries of big brain ideas which are boiled down to a paragraph or two. 

The mod team has had some backchannel success discussing how best to make a rule and we'd love your feedback.

In our view, spam is spam.   Copy/paste which is largely word salad and unoriginal is NOT the best use of AI.  If we can leverage **quality**  AI *assisted* content to make /r/ethereum even better, we're all for it as long as the user (here it comes...) also includes a disclaimer at the bottom or the top (or somewhere) that let's others know ""this content was supported by chatgpt"" or whatever....

To be clear, super long AI drivel is just Spam, so we're not reinventing the wheel here.  The rule is just more of a reminder than anything and we know it will take time for the messaging to get out there.

Maybe a rule that sounds something like:  ""If you are using AI assisted tooling for creating content, please disclose this in your submission""

What do you all think?  What should the rule read like?

Accounts linked to the developers of LIBRA earned more than 80 million dollars in what appears to be a rug-pull.

Accounts linked to those who launched this token earned over 80 million dollars, according to data analyzed by BubbleMaps.

Minutes ago, just before 1:00 AM (Argentine time) on February 15, Milei deleted the post on X and provided his explanation of the events.

The president stated that he made that post promoting the LIBRA cryptocurrency because he believed he was ""supporting a supposed private venture."" He clarified that he has no connection to that venture.

Milei adds: ""I was not fully aware of the details of the project, and after becoming informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet).""

The Argentine president concludes his post with a criticism of ""the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to cause harm."" To them, he directs his final words: ""I want to tell you that every day confirms how despicable politicians are, and it strengthens our conviction to kick them out.""

As CriptoNoticias reported, many Argentine bitcoiners were disappointed with the president's actions. Clearly—as evidenced by his latest message—the president promoted an alleged scam without being properly informed before making the post.

According to some experts, Milei could face legal consequences for this action, as it would be incompatible with his role as president.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,ethereum,Why Ethereum Needs More Gas Even with Layer 2 Solutions - Vitalik Buterin,2025-02-14 13:43:47,"Ethereum is like a busy road with all cars representing transactions and gas being the fuel needed to move the cars. The recent Ethereum roadmap has been focused on increasing the amount of gas on its main road - or L1 - even tho most are using side roads - L2s - in an attempt to avoid congestion

So in this scenario L2s are express lanes that help speed up transactions and be cheaper - but every now and then you actually need to have the main road for things like making sure your transaction cant be blocked - thats censorship resistance - moving separate items - like NFTs - between these express lanes or safely leaving these lanes in case something goes wrong

Vitalik explained that even during a lot of traffic on L2s there needs to be a wider main road - L1. This is equivalent to higher gas and when you have to use it - for example youre racing against time to sell something before prices go down - you can use it without high fees or lag. Also if everyone needs to exit L2s at the same time L1 needs to be big enough to handle this

Scaling L1 is about supporting more traffic and its about making Ethereum secure, fast and affordable for everyone - even while were using more efficient side streets. So while L2s are useful - scaling L1 keeps the whole system running smoothly

Reddit,ethereum,Decentralized deepfake Detection – Need Feedback on Architecture & Decentralization,2025-02-14 21:08:37,"

This is actually my bachelor's graduation project, and I'm trying to build a demo of a decentralized deepfake detection system. Since I'm relatively new to blockchain, AI, P2P networks, and federated learning, I'd really appreciate any feedback on my approach.

Goal of the Project

I want to create a decentralized system where anyone can check if an image or video is a deepfake without relying on a central authority. The AI model used for detection should continuously improve over time as deepfake techniques evolve. The system should be community-driven, with contributors rewarded for running inference models or helping update the AI model.

Current Technical Architecture

The system is built as a P2P network using libp2p, with three types of participants:

1. End users – Submit deepfake detection requests.


2. Worker nodes – Run inference on AI models to detect deepfakes.


3. Federated learning nodes – Train and improve the AI model, which workers later download.



Blockchain is used to reward worker and federated nodes with tokens for their contributions.

Workflow:

1. A user submits a detection request via a frontend (likely hosted on IPFS for permanence).


2. The frontend communicates with a gateway node in the P2P network.


3. The gateway node distributes the request to worker nodes running the AI model, distribution mechanism for now is just simple round-robin. 


4. The worker node publishes the result back to the network.


5. The gateway sends the result to the frontend and updates the smart contract to reward the worker.


6. Separately, federated learning nodes train a new model and upload it to IPFS, and worker nodes periodically download the latest model.



Main Concern – The Centralized Gateway Node

Right now, the gateway node is a single point of failure and controls task distribution. If someone modifies its code, they could manipulate task assignments or block certain nodes from participating.

I considered hashing the gateway’s code and making the smart contract only interact with a verified gateway, but I don’t think that’s possible. Also, calling the smart contract for every task completion might cause scalability issues due to gas fees.

Questions & Challenges

How can I decentralize the gateway node?

Is task distribution better handled on-chain, or should workers interact with the contract directly?

How do similar decentralized AI projects prevent manipulation?

Should I rethink the entire architecture for better scalability and decentralization?


This is just an early-stage demo, and I know security, task verification, and reputation systems and other stuff need to be added later. Right now, I want to get the architecture right before moving forward.


Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,ethereum,The Ungratefulness of Hating Vitalik Buterin,2025-02-13 13:02:18,"In the last few months Vitalik has frequently been target of abuse in crypto communities - in other subs and also across social media - especially from people who are upset about ETHs market performance

I think one of the most ungrateful things to do in this space is to hate Vitalik. Are people even aware that he imagined and created a brilliant blockchain platform that changed modern finance? At 19 years old - 19!!! When you were 19 what were you doing with your life? The creation of Ethereum was a technological revolution that built the basis for a new world - and it boosted the blockchains utility beyond its original intent

Even though the price isnt doing very good right now - Ethereum works as intended and has become safer with each upgrade. These haters ignore Ethereums immense impact and are either frustrated bag holders or butthurt maxis

Blockchain technology might not have progressed as far as it has without Vitaliks vision. Hating him fails to give the recognition he deserves for his contribution to the creation of Ethereum and consequently a large piece of the cryptocurrency sector. Plus the Ethereum Foundation has been working on changes. They pay attention to what the community has to say - people gotta learn to be patient instead of demanding action right away",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Today, in a regular 28-day restart cycle, we upgraded Ethereum to Pectra.

What does this mean? 

It means that if you operate a validator, or if you're thinking about it, you can now see how Max EB works in practice. You can [PoW mine](https://ephemery-faucet.pk910.de/) a thousand Ephemery Ether in a few minutes, and use that Ether to [launch validators](https://launchpad.ephemery.dev/en/) and use the 0x02 credential to stake up to 2048 Ether on one validator, and receive higher rewards for any whole number effective balance above 32. (In other words, you'll receive greater rewards if you stake 33, 34 Eth, etc.)

Ephemery is the PERFECT place to Fuck Around and Find Out how Pectra, Max EB, and 0x02 will affect validators.

The best part about all of this is you won't need to wait a long time for sync - because Ephemery resets every 28 days, there's no chain bloat to worry about.

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum Simulations​ are getting better with eth_simulateV2,2025-02-14 01:20:21,"Ethereum developers heavily rely on transaction simulations to test and debug [smart contracts](https://etherworld.co/2017/09/18/smart-contract-an-introduction/) before deploying them on-chain. These simulations allow them to estimate gas usage, validate execution paths, and prevent costly errors. However, the current tools—such as `eth_simulate`, `eth_call`, and `estimateGas`—come with several limitations that make accurate transaction testing difficult.

As [Ethereum](https://etherworld.co/tag/ethereum/) continues to evolve, the demand for more advanced simulation features is growing. Developers need better debugging tools, more reliable gas estimation, and improved transaction validation. This is where eth\_simulateV2 comes in—a potential upgrade that could introduce new capabilities to make simulations more robust and developer-friendly.

This blogpost explores the key issues with Ethereum’s current transaction testing methods and suggests how `eth_simulateV2` can address them.

Reddit,ethereum,ACDC #150: The Competitive Advantage of $ETH,2025-02-13 01:16:14,"In this week’s episode in Infinite Jungle, Christine Kim unpacks the latest Ethereum ACDC call #150. The conversation revolves around Ethereum’s competitive advantage and an important update on the upcoming Pectra mainnet activation. Here’s what you need to know:

**Pectra Activation Delayed**

Ethereum developers initially planned a faster rollout for the Pectra upgrade, but feedback from Layer-2 projects and staking providers led to a change of course. Concerns about the timeline being too aggressive resulted in a one-month delay, ensuring at least 30 days between the final public testnet upgrade and the mainnet launch. This extra time will allow for better preparation and smoother implementation.



**Ethereum’s Competitive Edge in a Crowded Blockchain Space**

Christine also explores why Ethereum continues to lead despite new challengers in the blockchain ecosystem. Key strengths include:

* Established Ecosystem – A massive developer community and deep-rooted integrations.
* Security & Decentralization – A proven track record with robust security mechanisms.
* Network Effects – The most widely used smart contract platform, with significant institutional adoption.

With Ethereum evolving and competition heating up, this episode offers valuable insights into the future of the ecosystem.

Reddit,ethereum,Staking ETH directly in Trust Wallet?,2025-02-13 09:02:30,"Hi everyone,

does anyone have experience with staking ETH directly on Trust Wallet? Is everything going smooth and would you say that the risks are less than staking on an exchange?
Are rewards being paid out regularly?

I‘m planning to stake a little amount and let it ride for a few years. Just want to be sure nothing bad is going to happen.

What concerns me, is the post of u/Embarrassed_Ad_8406 , who was not able to redeem any rewards after staking large amount of ETH. 

And one additional question: is there any information which validators are being used when staking directly in the Trust Wallet app? I want to be sure that they are all legit and my ETH doesn’t land in LIDO or RocketPool. If this is the case, then I can simply skip Trust Wallet and use these services myself.

Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Why Ethereum’s Transition to Proof of Stake Was a Mistake,2025-02-14 04:38:11,"
Ethereum’s move from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in September 2022 was celebrated as a major milestone in blockchain history. The transition, known as The Merge, promised lower energy consumption, greater network security, and improved scalability. However, while PoS delivered on some of these promises, the shift has introduced significant trade-offs that threaten Ethereum’s decentralization, security, and long-term viability.

1. Centralization Concerns

One of the biggest issues with PoS is that it favors the wealthy. Unlike PoW, where miners compete using computational power, PoS grants more influence to those who already hold the most ETH. This creates a system where the rich get richer, leading to centralization of power among a few large staking entities. Currently, a handful of major validators—like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance—control a disproportionate share of staked ETH. This centralization contradicts Ethereum’s original ethos of decentralization.

2. Security Trade-Offs

While PoS is often touted as being more secure, it introduces new attack vectors. In PoW, an attacker would need to acquire a massive amount of computational power, making a 51% attack extremely expensive. In PoS, an attacker only needs to accumulate 51% of staked ETH, which is much easier, especially given the concentration of stake among a few entities. Moreover, if a major staking service is compromised or coerced by regulators, Ethereum’s network security is at risk.

3. Censorship Risks and Regulatory Capture

PoS makes Ethereum more susceptible to regulatory control. Because many of the largest validators are based in jurisdictions with strict compliance requirements, they may be forced to comply with government demands to censor transactions. This became evident when over 60% of Ethereum blocks were found to be compliant with OFAC regulations post-Merge, raising concerns about Ethereum’s ability to remain a neutral, censorship-resistant network.

4. Weakening of Network Participation

Under PoW, anyone with a GPU could contribute to the Ethereum network. This created a broad and diverse group of miners worldwide. PoS, however, requires a minimum of 32 ETH (~$100,000 at recent prices) to become a validator, pricing out small participants. As a result, Ethereum’s validator set is now dominated by institutions and large holders, reducing overall network participation and making Ethereum feel more like a corporate-run system than a decentralized blockchain.

5. Economic Model Flaws

The shift to PoS altered Ethereum’s economic model in ways that may prove unsustainable. The reduction in ETH issuance and the introduction of Ethereum staking yield has turned ETH into an interest-bearing asset. While this might seem like a positive, it introduces systemic risks. If ETH becomes seen as just another yield-generating financial instrument rather than a fundamental layer for decentralized applications, it risks losing its utility over time. Additionally, yield-seeking behavior could lead to reckless staking strategies that destabilize the ecosystem.

6. Loss of Miner Security

PoW provided Ethereum with a battle-tested security mechanism. While mining consumed energy, it also ensured that validators had real-world costs, making it difficult for attackers to manipulate the network. PoS eliminates this cost barrier, meaning bad actors no longer need to expend resources to exert influence. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transition led to a mass exodus of miners, many of whom were forced to switch to less secure and less profitable chains, fragmenting the broader PoW ecosystem.

Final Thoughts: The Cost of Efficiency

Ethereum’s transition to PoS was framed as a necessary step for sustainability, but it came at a steep price. While it reduced energy consumption, it introduced centralization risks, weakened security guarantees, and made the network more vulnerable to regulatory capture.

Ethereum was once seen as the most promising decentralized computing platform. By shifting to a model that benefits large institutions at the expense of decentralization, it may have sacrificed the very principles that made it valuable in the first place.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,I wish I had friends,2025-02-21 21:26:21,"I wish I had friends to talk to about BTC. I've spent the last decade of my life learning and watching. BTC has changed my life like nothing else ever has. Most people I encounter are oblivious to it or just don't understand it. My amazing wife engages my rants but I'm usually left with a blank stare and confusion. I wish so much I had peers to share in my passion for blockchain and crypto. Do you exist? Maybe, just not in my experience. Are they lurking or are they standing near me and I just dont know it. Come out please! Is it still weird to talk about crypto in public?  

I asked Gemini to expand on this for me and this what I got back. 

A Decade in the Rabbit Hole: Anyone Else Feel Isolated in Their Bitcoin Journey?

Hey! Anyone who gets it,

I've been down the Bitcoin rabbit hole for almost a decade now. It started as a curious blip on my radar, but over the years, it's become a fundamental part of how I see the world. I've spent countless hours reading, researching, and watching the space evolve. It's changed my life in profound ways, from how I think about money and technology to my understanding of freedom and decentralization.

But here's the thing: I feel incredibly isolated.
Most people I encounter have no idea what I'm talking about when I mention Bitcoin. They see it as a volatile gamble, a scam, or something only tech bros care about. My wife, bless her heart, tries to engage with my rants, but I can see the confusion in her eyes. It's like trying to explain quantum physics to someone who's never done basic math.

I crave genuine conversations about Bitcoin and the broader crypto space. I want to discuss the latest advancements, the philosophical implications, the potential for societal change. I want to share my passion with people who understand it, who feel the same excitement I do.

Here's what I'm wondering:
 * Are you out there? Are there others like me, passionate about Bitcoin but feeling isolated in their local communities?

 * Where are you hiding? Are you lurking in online forums, attending meetups, or just keeping your passion to yourself?

 * Is it still weird to talk about crypto in public? I sometimes hesitate to bring it up in casual conversations, fearing I'll be labeled a ""crypto bro"" or dismissed as a lunatic.

 * How do you connect with like-minded individuals? Are there specific online communities or real-world events that you've found helpful?

 * Have you had similar experiences with your family and friends? How do you navigate those conversations?

 * For those of you who have found your tribe, how did you do it? What steps did you take?
I honestly feel like I'm living in two different worlds. One where Bitcoin is the future, and another where it's a fringe curiosity. I desperately want to bridge that gap.

I know there are millions of people around the world who are passionate about Bitcoin. But it often feels like we're scattered, hidden in plain sight.

Have a great weekend all.

Reddit,bitcoin,Has my friend lost his wallet?,2025-02-22 05:10:27,"A friend of mine is in a panic thinking he's lost access to his stash of BTC that is in a Bitcoin Core (old pre 0.15 version) wallet - without a password (!! yes i know) on a single old PC that has died, with only a USB copy of the wallet.dat

PC aside (I told him he needs to get the drive looked at as it can be likely be recovered), is he out of luck retrieving the private keys from this wallet.dat if the new version of BCore doesn't recognize the file?

Info I know:

- His old PC was running an older version of BCore on windows, he had no password, would just open it up and be able to send, sign messages etc.
- It had some addresses stored in the wallet too, so they should be visible immediately upon loading it up if the file is healthy right
- As far as he knows he doesn't have any passphrase written down, all he has is this wallet.dat and the public address
- The public address still shows the btc balance he expects (on the blockchain)
- He had a copy of the wallet.dat on a USB drive and it's about 1MB
- Last he new he had some BTC in 2011, sold some but should still have some left, not sure when the last transaction was though
- He's installed new BCore on a new PC, copied file over but it won't load. Apparently it's not fully synched - but at only 7 years out it still showed nothing (plus I guess the wallet.dat didn't even really load anyway)
- I understand if he had a pre 0.15 (pre-SQLite) wallet it wouldn't be compatible with the newer BCore? Does that mean it wouldnt even load at all?

So far we've tried:

- Opening the wallet.dat on a new install of BCore but it just rejects it
- Deleting the default wallet.dat from appdata and replacing it with this one, but it just wipes over it on start up
- Installing 0.14.3 and is currently synching that up to try

So question is - what is his best bet? And most importantly how can he know whether the USB wallet.dat copy is not corrupt? Even if it is, can he extract the private keys?

Thanks, he's pretty stressed out.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,bitcoin,Is it ok to do it this way?,2025-02-21 18:05:50,"I’ve set up a friend with a Trezor cold wallet. He’s got his seed phrase on metal and backed up. 
He buys his BTC via Strike and sends it over to cold storage every 0.1 BTC he accumulates to avoid too many UTXOs. 

However, he’s going to be going travelling for 7-8 months and won’t be bringing any laptop with him or that. He’s not very tech savvy to begin with. So he wanted to know if he took a screenshot of the QR code of his cold storage wallet address and used that same address to send his BTC to from Strike every time he accumulates a nice few Sats would that be ok to do? 

I told him yes, but it would be to the same address each time. 

Any thoughts on this or any other recommendations? 

Basically he won’t be able to generate a new address in his trezor to send his BTC as he travels for 7-8 months. ",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,bitcoin,Registered wallets: A proposal for governments to collect tax revenue in a bitcoin world,2025-02-22 04:48:05,"Libertarian movement let's go, but we cant live in mad max, tax is the game, so let's work this out.

Imagine a scenario... hyperinflation, total USD/banking collapse. Everybody runs for the exists of what's left to transfer their wealth into bitcoin. Bitcoin becomes the world wide base currency. All buying and selling of goods and services are now processed through the bitcoin network. There is no longer any functioning central banking monetary system with fiat value. A government is obviously still needed to maintain law and order, among other things. The government who is law maintaing but also acting as somewhat of a law enforcement agency on behalf of central banks to collect tax revenue from the people to pay back the interest on the money that was originally loaned from the central banks to the governments now has a problem..... How can you trust/confirm that the citizen has declared the correct taxable amount.

So for example John owns a pizza shop. John sells each pizza for $20. John sold 10,000 pizzas in one year. 10,000 X $20 = $200,000. John has a bitcoin wallet for his business. Wallet A is registered through a government initiated program that identify John (using his passport, birth cert etc) as the owner of the wallet allowing him to conduct his business with this wallet only. However John also creates wallet B (unregistered/unidentified) and conducts half of his pizza business transactions through this wallet. John declares $100,000 of taxable yearly profits to the government and keeps wallet B off record, keeping $100,000 of tax free bitcoin.

The government could impose a federal Value Added Tax to all goods/services however the ability to sidestep this with the creation of an anonymous wallet remains.

So now the only way I can think of is that the government could create laws stating that any business caught transacting with an unregistered wallet could be subject to a fine/prison sentence. This would make most citizens purchasing goods/services not willing to do transactions with any unregistered wallet, especially when there would also be little to no benefit from the buyers side. However the incentive to sell goods with an unregistered wallet would still remain, as some people would always want to cheat the system. However the percentage of people willing to risk this and depending on their business and service offered could prove to be difficult to get away with.

Then in this world I believe governments could effectively collect a sustainable amount of tax revenue in bitcoin from the citizens to maintain a functioning and law abiding state. A surplus of bitcoins could only come from less government expenditure than bitcoins collected from the previous year and of course the ability for any central bank to print/create extra bitcoins is impossible. Without the ability to create bitcoins the government and banking sector would be highly self regulated as any bitcoin they acquire through taxation would have to be wisely spent/voted upon with the primary interest of the people (as opposed to a centralized few) to maintain a functioning and productive society.

So while having this thought and typing it out this morning I kind of answered my own question in the process, but I might be wrong, so ill still ask, is there any other way a government could ever enforce or know the true amount of goods and services of any business operated worldwide when anybody can create anonymous wallets and transact within them?",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

The discussion examines how the global banking dollar system favors institutions over individuals, positioning Bitcoin as a financial alternative and store of value. It highlights the lack of education on money and credit systems, even among finance students, and explores the idea of an online community for those who see Bitcoin as a tool for personal and societal growth.

From my understanding, Bitcoin is now increasingly held by large institutions, so what's the difference between this and the traditional banking system?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The rCryptoCurrency Moon Week 58 Moon Burn Update and a Community Funded Moon giveaway.,2025-02-18 01:50:27,"Welcome to the Moon Burn Update for Moon Week 58. In this post we'll take a look at all Moon Burns between January 6th and February 2nd[.](https://imgur.com/a/10Jb44H) We'll also introduce a community funded Moon Giveaway (you can enter in the first 48 hours that this post is live).

# What are Moons:

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub. [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors on  as an appreciation for their help or contributions on Reddit. (make sure you comment for a Moon Tip)

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days.

# Let's talk Moon Week 58 Moon Burns:

Between January 6th February 2nd:

* 28,844 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in two unique burn events:
* 28,587 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum One ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in ten unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is: 57,431 Moons.

# Moon Burn Ranking Update:

Moons are the 11th most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum One **(up one since the last update)** with \~243k Moons having been burned so far on Arbitrum One

https://preview.redd.it/xjaahb0awsje1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=e645cd36b64eb8e430599e1f4c0fbb1163b3f2d4

Unlike most assets in the burn address on One, no Moons were ever minted for the sole supply of being burned. Nearly all the Moons in the dead address on One were purchased off the open market and burned by web three entities looking to host AMAs or customize the rCC banner.

\-----

Moons remain the most valuable asset in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova with \~2.752M Moons having been burned to date and accounting for over 99.9% of the value of all tokens in the burn address on Arbitrum Nova.

The last burn update introduced a way to win 500 Moons by guessing how many Moons will be burned in 2025? Go to the last Moon Burn update and leave your guess (if you haven't yet done so). Redditors have until April 1st to leave a guess - [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i0o8mz/the\_rcryptocurrency\_moon\_week\_57\_moon\_burn\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i0o8mz/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_57_moon_burn_update/)

From Users perspective there's no question that they need to transfer out their crypto from bybit even when the CEO says ""funds are safu""
From Bybit's perspective let's assume that they have 1:1 assets backed for all the users but just by saying this no one's going to put their trust in you and no one should. If I were the CEO instead of saying ""funds are safu because 1:1"" I would also say that ""Users who wish to withdraw their funds and can do so and we are going to process all the withdrawals till then we are offering ZERO fees on Spot and Futures trading"". What this does is if they do actually have 1:1 assets to fund the withdrawals then good people get their crypto but Bybit also doesn't lose their credibility in the long run.
It's almost given that almost everyone is anyways going to withdraw their crypto from bybit but by saying this they would instill trust if they still want to exist as an exchange. 
Continuation to this strategy they should also post the number of withdrawals processed in record time this would additionally allow them to gain back the goodwill in future by saying remember when we were hacked and still got your back.

All this is assuming they do have the funds.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,OpenSea Investigation Closed - Huge Win For NFTs & Web3!,2025-02-22 08:18:36,"Just crossed with this great [Tweet](https://x.com/dfinzer/status/1893086281300582772) about OpenSea investigation closed by the SEC. In the Tweet OpenSea CEO and cofounder announces that the SEC is closing its investigation into OpenSea. This is a huge win for the entire NFT and Web3 space because for months there has been uncertainty about how regulators would classify NFTs with an attempt to label them as securities which would be a big step backwards.

[OpenSea](https://preview.redd.it/t2nbqqxjgnke1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=dabfd48195951f98cd47c86968e9d0b060c65aca)

From my point of view, NFTs are just digital collectibles, art, membership passes, gaming assets, etc. and there is still a lot of work to do regarding this because definitely they don't fit into the outdated regulatory framework which would have slowed innovation and hurt a lot of creators.

This is a clear shift in the recent trend against crypto and it signals that builders in the NFT space can continue pushing boundaries without unnecessary fear.

Regulation is important but it needs to be fair and realistic for every specific thing and I believe governments will categorize them into some sort of collectible part with specific rules but it will be good for the crypto space. This also makes me really bullish on Reddit Collectible Avatars because clarity into rules will allow Reddit to build a clearer roadmap to push this amazing project forward.

Don’t bother shouting down others, just what’s your thing and why.

I’ll start.

I’m an XRP led ISO20022 and utility guy.
I used to be a professional FX broker, moved to stocks and trading quarterly’s and settled on being a gold bug. I always sought an edge but saw that after Covid, the gold store of value was nonsense and I gave up looking for edges and started following the policy makers instead - WEF,IMF ET AL and came upon ISO2022. Then XRP.

To have always been going against the big guys to tuning in to what they’re doing, I found what I personally think t they’re gonna be utilising and XRP/ Ripple and all their behind the scenes work with governments and central banks convinced me.

I’m always open to new ideas and recognise that tribalism and echo chambers get in the way of hearing valuable insights and opinions.

* **Solana**, on the other hand, processed a block with **1,568 transactions**, but the majority **failed** and people had to pay for their failed transactions.

This raises questions about the **true effective throughput** of networks. If a blockchain can theoretically do 50,000 TPS but 90% of transactions fail, what’s the real performance?

There is so much bullshit and fraud in this space.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,A few of us from r/cc built a trading bot platform from scratch—because most of them suck,2025-02-21 10:18:51,"A few of us from this sub got fed up with every trading bot we tried and decided to build our own from scratch—because, frankly, most of them suck.

We’ve been hacking away at this project for 3 years now, and it’s wild to think that we all connected through this sub. We’re a small team of 6 who wanted to easily manage our investment strategies algorithmically, but also offer trading features for those interested.

The idea came to us after we all had similar experiences with the current solutions out there, and we were fed up with how these platforms market themselves. Many of them made promises such as ""passive income"" worry-free investing, which largely contributed to the stigma around trading bot platforms.

The reality is that algo investing or algo trading is only as good as the strategies you're feeding into it. Yes, they can help you find new strategies and test your current ones but ultimately, you are in control of your strategy, your entry and your exit.

Building this is easily one of the hardest engineering challenges that any of us have faced thus far, but we finally got the application past an MVP stage.

One of the biggest issues with the current solutions out there is that they are incredibly unintuitive to use. Even when trying to create a simple auto DCA for multiple coins we saw needless complexity crammed on a single page. 

For instance:

https://preview.redd.it/7iubdri8vgke1.png?width=1271&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4faf830aec88a0fd5a2fa1b37fbd6f5deb8d034

We thought it makes more sense to use a step-by-step approach and not overload the screen (and the user) with too many configuration options:

https://preview.redd.it/h8lvrzpbvgke1.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=c637964db39d1fb0cac5a79f3597ff0f03a32e30

We also added a SocialHub, where users can easily clone other configurations and each strategy can be launched in paper trading mode. Again - some of the tools we've used only allow an overall demo vs live account, with no option to choose the state of a single strategy.

We still got a lot of work to do but at least this is a start.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Crypto Isn’t Dead—It’s Just Buried Under a Pile of Trash Tokens 🚮,2025-02-20 14:54:29,"Man, I miss when crypto *actually meant something.*  
Back when there were just a few projects, all focused on solving *real problems*—not this mess we’ve got now.

These days? It’s like every other hour there’s a new memecoin popping up with zero utility, just some pump-and-dump scheme to drain liquidity from actual projects that *deserve* attention. And people eat it up because “quick gains” are more exciting than long-term innovation.

What happened to building tech that could *change the world*?  
Now it’s just influencers shilling garbage, devs launching rug pulls, and everyone chasing the next hype train. No roadmap, no vision—just greed disguised as ""community.""

It’s exhausting. If you know, you know.  
If you’re still here for *real* crypto—actual use cases, long-term growth, and projects that *matter*—I see you. The rest? Good luck with your tenth dog-themed coin this month.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Is Pi Network a Scam? Confused About the Launch and Its Future,2025-02-21 10:27:45,"Hey everyone, I’m new to the world of crypto and I’ve been following Pi Network for a while now, and colecteing coins. I’m really confused and frustrated, and I could really use some simple explanations from people who know more about this stuff.

First off, the starting price for Pi seems really low. Is that normal for a new crypto launch? I get that it’s a new coin, but I’m wondering if it’s too low to be sustainable.

What’s making me even more suspicious is that after the launch, the creators of Pi haven’t really said much about how things are going. Shouldn’t they be updating people or being more transparent? It just feels odd that there’s no word from them.

Also, I’ve noticed that the Pi app has ads, and there’s a KYC (Know Your Customer) process. I’m starting to wonder if those things might make the creators more money than the price of Pi when it launches. Does anyone think that could be a red flag or maybe a sign that they’re making money in ways other than through the coin itself?

Honestly, I’m starting to wonder if this is a scam. I’ve heard a lot of mixed opinions, but I just need some clear, simple answers. Is Pi Network worth it, or should I be really worried about this whole thing?

Would love to hear your thoughts, and please, keep the responses simple. I’m still learning all this crypto stuff.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Meme Coins Are the New Dot-Com Bubble—And They’re Fucked,2025-02-20 16:10:42,"Meme coins are basically the dot-com bubble on steroids—same hype, same bullshit, just with more Twitter influencers pumping garbage. Back in the ’90s, slapping “.com” on a company name was enough to send stocks soaring, even if the company had no business model, no revenue, and no real plan. Sound familiar? Remember Pets.com? Went public with a $300 million valuation, dead a year later. eToys? Worth $8 billion at its peak—bankrupt in months.

Now fast forward to today, and we’ve got the same circus with meme coins. Dogecoin, created as a literal joke, hit an $88 billion market cap—bigger than some of the biggest companies on the planet. Shiba Inu, another pointless token, once flipped Doge in valuation. And let’s not even talk about the thousands of useless meme coins that pop up daily, each promising to be “the next big thing” while offering absolutely nothing. It’s all just glorified gambling with fancy dog logos.

And trust me, I’ve seen this shit before. I bought eBay back in the day when it was dirt cheap, but like an idiot, I sold it for a small profit instead of holding on. If I had kept it, I’d be sitting on a fortune. But at least I was investing in something real—an actual business with revenue, not some pump-and-dump meme coin that’s just gonna vanish when the hype dies.

And here’s the kicker—just like the dot-com crash wiped out 90% of those garbage stocks, the same fate is coming for meme coins. The second regulations hit and the big money moves on to actual projects with real utility, all this meme coin bullshit is going to collapse. Sure, a few might survive, just like Amazon and Google did after the dot-com crash, but the rest? They’re fucked. And the only people left holding the bag will be the ones who thought this shit was gonna last forever.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Crypto isn't about ""one crypto to rule them all"". It's not a case of ""there can only be one"".

It's the coin that has shown to be solid, has a solid network and security, doesn't have questionable teams behind it, is more than decentralized enough, and the coin people trust the most to work.

It's solid, when it comes to holding your coins digitally like gold.

But it's not the end all answer to all crypto problems.

# Other coins and chains that will still be needed:

**1- A fast and cheap point of sale crypto.**

There will still be a need for a coin with fast and cheap transactions, that's scalable, with a chain that can handle heavy traffic. Something easy to integrate in point of sales systems, that's easy for buying a coffee.

**2- A dev chain.**

A blockchain built for developers, that's more ideal to build on, with smart contracts.

**3- A business chain.**

Similar to a dev chain, but more business oriented.

**4- Industry specialized chains or projects.**

Some industries like real estate, medical, scientific research, social media, gaming, etc.. may require a more specialized chain for their industry. Just for a few cases where a dev/business/trilemma chain may not be enough.

**5- Chains or projects specialized in a specific tech feature.**

These are your chains or projects specialized in a key tech solution like oracle, indexing, interoperability, IOT, AI, etc...

**6- A trilemma chain.**

This will be your swiss army chain. The chain that solves the trilemma and is strong enough at security, scalability, and decentralization.

# Coins and chains that won't be needed (probably 90% of what's out there):

1- Any chain that's not doing something new or doing something other chains are already doing, and not even doing it better.

2- Any chain that's doing something too centralized.

3- Any chain that's not solving a tech problem, a lifestyle problem, a business problem, or an industry problem.

4- Any token where the token itself is not needed in the system.

5- Any project with too much control from a team, or a poor team behind it.

6- Anything that's not bringing something to the table.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Safemoon Executive Thomas Smith changes plea from ""Not Guilty"" to ""Guilty"". John Karony to follow?",2025-02-20 21:53:40,"DOMINO, BIATCH!  

What is up ladies and gents. I'm back, and I'm *still talking about Safe fucking moon!*  

I'll be real, the interest on this shit has turned up to 11 since the arrest of John Karony & Thomas Smith way back on Halloween 2023.  

###Where to begin?  

---  

The legal case has been **fascinating**. Thomas Smith and John were arrested. Thomas was let out on bail after agreeing to co-operate, whereas John was jailed in some grotty New York prison for 3 months. He got out on $3m bail, paid by his parents, in exchange for dropping the [lawsuit he had on his own mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xrmlxu/safemoon_ceo_john_karony_sues_his_own_mother_in/)  

To date, John's defense arguments have been as follows:  

* Extraterritoriality - ""You can't convict me under these US Laws because Safemoon runs on Binance Blockchain which isn't a US Blockchain""  
* Public Disclosure - ""Even though I made representations in plain English about the status of the Liquidity Pool locks, anyone could've followed the blockchain evidence and found that I was in fact acting in contradiction to my prior statements  
* Public Authority Defense - ""I spoke to an FBI Agent while I was working at Safemoon, and he didn't sanction my actions"" (*Footnote, John hasn't submitted this as an actual defense, and the FBI Agent in question apparently had no understanding of Cryptocurrency) 

As you can see, these aren't great arguments to combat charges of Wire Fraud, Securities Fraud and Money Laundering.  

In fact, they all look like loopholes to me, and in lieu of any actual defense, in combination with the blockchain evidence, chat logs, private messages and social media posts that all corroborate the blockchain evidence, it sure seems like John is guilty as fuck.  

---  

###So while all that's going on.. 

Today, after not really hearing from Thomas or his lawyers for a long time, [Thomas Smith has officially entered into court to change his plea from ""Not Guilty"" to ""Guilty""](https://x.com/live4offrd/status/1892652885051375703)  

What this means is that Thomas should be looked at slightly more favourably by the Government, instead of dragging out a trial. He could provide more information to help them secure a conviction against Karony, and might even avoid jailtime entirely, but that's my speculation.  


---  
###That's Thomas and John... Where's Kyle Nagy?  


So Kyle was the third executive charged by the DOJ & SEC. He was never arrested. Nobody knew where he was, for a very long time, [until this salacious news story popped up from Russia of all places.](https://www.newsweek.com/safemoon-florida-man-crypto-fraud-russia-fsb-2010979)  

As a summary, Kyle was living with his family in Dubai when the indictments were unsealed. He had a Russian contact, who recommended he relocate to Russia and that this contact could get him a golden visa in exchange for $1m. When he got set up in Russia, he ran afoul of some corrupt FSB agents who continued to extort him, threatening violence against his family. Apparently, he went to the Russian police and submitted a legal complaint about them, which is how we know about it.  

So which of the two punishments do Safemoon executives deserve? Federal prison, or a Russian gulag?",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Pi Network: A Success Story for the Poorest Populations,2025-02-21 00:01:45,"
I want to take a moment to reflect on Pi Network and how it has reached and exceeded its long-term goal of launching on mainnet.

For years, I followed and advocated for this project (on a previous account, now unavailable). My argument was simple: Pi had the potential to be a game-changer, particularly for truly endemically poor populations who participated.

When I made those posts, I was met with heavy skepticism. The most common counterpoint? “Pi isn’t listed on an exchange, so it’s worthless.” That was a fair take at the time, but I always wished my posts were taken in the spirit they were intended—a plea to highlight the potential impact of a cryptocurrency that didn’t require upfront capital to mine and could provide meaningful economic opportunities to those who needed it most.

Fast forward to today, and Pi launched at nearly $0.80 per coin. Regardless of skepticism or criticism, that’s an astonishing achievement. Anyone who stuck with this project for years—clicking the same button, disabling ads every two weeks—had their chance to cash out today. And for some, that payout was life-changing.

This is what I’ve always loved about cryptocurrency: it has the potential to level the playing field. Someone with little capital but persistence, curiosity, and patience can make a real monetary impact in their life.

What Makes Pi Unique?

The entire premise of Pi was to distribute a small slice of the “pie” to anyone who actively participated in the network. Unlike traditional mining, which requires expensive hardware and electricity, Pi’s mining process was simple and inclusive.

But the biggest technical hurdle—KYC verification—was a crucial step to prevent abuse. If implemented fairly and transparently, this mechanism could be a game-changer in removing bad actors from the system and ensuring only real, verified individuals could claim their coins.

The Future of Pi: Sustainable or Not?

It took over six years of beta testing to reach this point. While I’ll be the first to admit that the app and wallet UI leave a lot to be desired, the fact remains: Pi is now liquid. At $0.60+ per coin, anyone with the technical ability can trade it on exchanges and convert it into their local currency.

Whether this price holds or not is another question. Maybe there truly is a thriving market in Asia for Pi. Maybe it will grow into its own ecosystem. Or maybe it will fade over time.

Regardless of what happens next, I’m just happy to see that Pi accomplished its core mission: giving the poorest populations a chance to participate in a new financial system and claim a small piece of the pi

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Shorting Solana and Why I’m doing it (Solana Fan),2025-02-20 13:48:41,"So I’m a long term solana buyer and holder.

I’ve made great returns on it, but recently I believe I miscalculated what was going to happen after the trump pump.

I was holding on to an older way of thinking, and because I didn’t sell near the trump pump high, I was waiting to get back to those highs. I’m sure many of you are doing this rn.

However I decided to get on the sideline with SOL after the Libra scandal because my profits were sliding away fast. I’m not a hodlr, I like to time the market strategically during market trends. This has worked very well for me, with some bad calls here and there.

Given that background, I’ve been conducting a significant amount of market research on Solana and want to provide you all this information so you’re not stuck in an echo chamber 

Negative Narrative:

Solana has earned its way to the scammers paradise through meme pump and dumps

Solana already had a huge run up the last 1-2 years

FTX reimbursements are entering the market soon

LIBRA scandal (there is more to this watch the coffeezilla video) this could get a lot more ugly if what’s reported is true

Potential for exchange crash. There seems to be a huge scandal on an exchange every cycle. In this case there may be a black swan event around USDC (SOL) or JUP or another platform. (This is a stretch, but if it were gonna happen somewhere I believe it would happen on the solana network this cycle)

Other networks are viewed as more reliable or for serious business like Ethereum or Cardano

Positive Narrative:

SOL can do what it’s always done, provide a network for extremely fast and cost effective transactions 

Tax feee American cryptos

That’s about it

Price movement:

Everyone is aware how poorly SOL is doing in the last 7-30 days. It’s been hit a lot worse than the rest of the market. Even though the market is in the red, SOL is significantly lower

SOL price chart shows SOL about to dump right before the Trump Pump. One could argue we would have been at the current price sooner if not for that event.

Next lower resistance is in the 150s and then the 120s. With so much FUD, I would not be surprised that if we break through 160 that we end up at 120 in a 7 day period.

Competition:

XRP has positive narratives currently and none of the negative environment that surrounds solana

Ethereum is the first mover and 2nd largest crypto. It has a huge L2 network for low fees and has a lot of room for price growth this cycle

SUI, like solana without all the FUD

Conclusion:

Given all this information, I believe SOL will reach 120s as the new low and hold in that price area for the remainder of the alt bull run while other coins prosper. 

It may go even lower once alt season ends and we are in a true bear market.

I am a huge fan of SOL, it is my favorite crypto. However my main goal is to make money, and this is how I am seeing it.

As Thanos would say, “I’m sorry little one”

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Seems like ages since I first posted about this project on here, a few years ago a bunch of us from this sub got together to build a trading bot platform with the features we wished other platforms had. Today we celebrate our biggest release yet",2025-02-20 21:59:12,"We've been working on this tool for about 3 years now, and it's kind of amazing to think that this sub brought us together in the first place.

We're a team of 6 people, and all of us met through the various discussions on this sub, and decided we want to build a better trading bot platform.

Before I continue - let me quickly clarify what that is as there's some misconception about trading bots (most likely due to how many of them market themselves).

A Trading bot platform is not some magical passive income machine, that makes you rich while you sleep as some would have you believe. It's a tool that helps you automate or find new viable strategies through testing your results in an iterative process. So a bot will only be as good as you'll configure it to be. The truth is if your go to is to buy high and sell low, it will help you do that - just more consistently and efficiently.

So anyway, when we started building this, we had some idea of the complexity of the tool, but one thing that turned out to be a lot more challenging than we thought is the infrastructure layer of the app, which determines how the app scales with user demand.

  
Another pain point we came across was the UI itself. Some of you that tested the tool said it's not intuitive enough and there's some jank to it - and I couldn't agree more. I mean the first version was super rough. We then made some incremental improvements, however, it wasn't until this release that the app is really getting closer to the original vision, at least in terms of the UX.

We took something that looked like this:

https://preview.redd.it/x6g2b4ll7dke1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4abfd7226beb327d038b60537ff43a80369f510c

Aesir (the app's name) has really come a long way both in terms of functionality as well as ease of use and I wanted to share this update with you all. We're going to continue working on it and add more features. Our long-term vision is for Aesir to be an all-in-one portfolio management tool, that can help you manage your investments across multiple asset classes and even automatically re-balance for instance between stocks and crypto based on your instructions.

That's far in the future but I think there's a lot of value in that.

The app is free to use and all strategies can be tested before deploying live, so feel free to give it a try if you like. And if you have any ideas on how to improve the tool, let me know!

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

i notice there are big players in the field of secure messaging that are close-source and seem to get away with claims of being secure, private, e2ee, etc.

i would like to get your thoughts about what encourages trust in security implementations when it some to close-source projects.

i have 2 projects to compare.

1. a p2p file transfer project where it uses webrtc in a browser to enable p2p file-transfer. this project is close source.

while there are several bug-fixes in the p2p file-transfer project, the codebase is largely the same. both projects are source-code-available because they are webapps. its important to note that while the ""chat"" project is presented as unminified code, ""file"" is presented as minified and obfuscated code (as close-sourced as i can make it?). claiming the ""codebase is largely the same"" becomes more meaningless/unverifyable after this process.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

I know pre-Quantum Asymmetric systems reasonably well & I also understand Abstract Algebra reasonably well.

I was trying to look up Coding Theory & it seems like a separate subject by itself. Is everything in the whole of Coding theory relevant for PQC Coding Systems?

Is understanding the basics enough - if yes, what would constitute basics in a typical book on Coding Theory (I need to look for the right book also).

**EDIT:** For e.g. to understand Pre-Quantum Elliptic Curve Cryptography, I don't need to know deep algebraic geometry - just the basics are enough - I don't need to know Affine Varieties, Isogenies, Riemann–Roch, Divisors, Weil Conjectures etc as long as I am not planning to design something new based on ECs. Just understanding basics of EC over Finite Fields, addition/doubling of points, additive group, algebraic closures etc is enough.

Reddit,crypto,NIST STS questions and use with encrypted data,2025-02-19 01:34:34,"**Hello cryptos.**

I'm testing output of an encryption algorithm and would like to know if a test collection of STS results of a very high quantity will be meaningful.

My test plan that I'm running right now...

1. Creation of 803 cleartext samples across 7 groups:
   * **RepetitivePatterns**
      * These are things like repeating bytes, repeating tuple and triples, repeating short ordered sequences, and so on.
      * The patterns are of increasing sizes from around 511 bytes to just over 4MB.
   * **LowEntropy**
      * These are cleartext samples that have only a few available bytes in total to distribute.
      * Some samples are just random orders and others are cases where the few bytes are separated by large runs of another like: `AnnnnnnnBnnnCnnnnnnnnBnnnnnnC`
   * **NaturalLanguage**
      * These are randomly constructed English language sentences and paragraphs.
      * Of varying lengths, varying sentences per paragraph, and varying quantity of paragraphs.
   * **RandomData**
      * Varying lengths of random bytes from a CSRNG.
   * **PreCompressed**
      * Using the same construction from NaturalLanguage, Brotli compress the data and use that as cleartext samples.
      * Also of varying lengths.
   * **BinaryExe**
      * Enumerate files from the local file system for DLL/EXE files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Windows\System32` and subfolders.
   * **Structured**
      * Enumerate XML/HTML/JSON/RTF/CSV files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Program Files` and subfolders.
2. For each cleartext, encrypt and append the output (without padding) to a file. 
3. Run ENT for the file as well as STS. STS params are: 2 million bits length and 100 streams, enabling all tests (takes about 9-12 mins per file). 
4. Record the results in a DB.

**Am I misinterpreting the value of STS for analyzing encrypted data?**  
**Will I gain any useful insights by this plan?**

I've run it for about 24 hours so far and have done over **9 million encrypts** and over **1100 STS executions**.  
Completion will be just over **3000 runs** and near **20 million encrypts**.

For any that are curious, I created a sandbox that uses the same encryption here:  [https://bllnbit.com](https://bllnbit.com)

Should the rendezvous server be trusted?Cannot the relay server  brute force them offline?

I’m sure I’m missing something here.

Reddit,crypto,Getting into a PhD program without publications and as an avid CTF player,2025-02-17 18:25:03,"I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a somewhat decent CGPA, looking into PhD opportunities in the US. My main concern is my lack of publications - my only research experience comes from my undergrad thesis, which focused on reverse engineering rather than cryptography. Most of my cryptography knowledge comes from actively participating in CTF competitions, solving and upsolving challenges, and studying related papers and source materials that got my interest. I did have one crypto course during my undergrad but that was a very beginner level course.

You could prove the inputs for each iteration of the loop outputs the inputs for the next iteration of the loop. This is highly parallelisable and the polynomials involved would be tiny making inversion steps much simpler.

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Reddit,crypto,The Importance of Releasing Cryptographic Software to the Public,2025-02-04 02:46:00,"Today we live in a world where businesses still use closed-source cryptographic software--which is a violation of that principle. I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

Reddit,crypto,Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,2025-01-25 12:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082
Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-02-22 12:16:32.950082

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.
