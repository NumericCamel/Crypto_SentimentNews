With a remarkable rally surpassing $75,000, Bitcoin is experiencing considerable momentum, driven primarily by market sentiment surrounding the US elections. A crypto analyst who had accurately predicted Bitcoin’s rise to $75,000 has now set a new price target for the pioneer cryptocurrency, anticipating further bullish movement. Analyst Set $170,000 Price ATH For The Bitcoin Price TradingShot, a crypto analyst on TradingView, has released a brief Bitcoin analysis report, referencing historical trends to predict a new all-time high of $170,000 for Bitcoin. Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements from 2022 to the present, the analyst disclosed that on August 5, Bitcoin was testing the 1-week Moving Average (MA50), a level that has never been reached since March 12, 2003. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? In previous market cycles, this crucial level was the absolute supporting trendline that signaled a potential bull market. TradingShot revealed that after almost 20 years, the Bitcoin price was finally able to hold this key trendline not once but twice, leading to its last-week rally that saw its price testing the $73,800 mark.  The analyst also highlighted that this price surge was an incredibly bullish move, indicating a strong market for Bitcoin. Moreover, the $73,800 Bitcoin price increase occurred just two days before the US Presidential elections, a period historically known to trigger explosive rallies for Bitcoin. Market expert Crypto Rover on X (formerly Twitter) notes that Bitcoin has experienced a total average price pump of 1,563% following the previous US elections. In 2016, Bitcoin rallied 2,714%, exceeding $15,000 after the US Presidential elections. Similarly, in 2020, the cryptocurrency soared over 400%, surpassing $40,000 after the elections. Now, Bitcoin is clearly on a significant uptrend after the just-concluded US presidential elections on November 4.  Given the timing of these rallies, TradingShot has suggested that a similar pattern may be repeating, implying that Bitcoin could be entering a period of explosive growth. Based on chart analysis and Fibonacci levels, the analyst has projected a new target of $170,000 for Bitcoin, representing approximately 1.618 Fibonacci extensions from its current ATH.  With the Bitcoin price currently trading at $73,715, having given up some gains, a surge to $170,000 would represent a 130,55% increase.  BTC Finally Hits Anticipated Price Discovery With Bitcoin finally reaching a new ATH after months of speculation and anticipation, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has disclosed that this surge signals the cryptocurrency’s entry into its price discovery.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought A Bitcoin price discovery refers to how the market determines the current value or price based on supply and demand dynamics. Despite the new achievement, Martinez has revealed that investors are attempting to short Bitcoin by liquidating their holdings and cashing out profits.  As a result, the analyst predicts that if Bitcoin goes back to the $75,550 price high, $210 million could be liquidated from the market.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Not Dogecoin But This Altcoin Is the Best Pick Post-Trump Win, Says Crypto CEO",2024-11-06 23:00:57+00:00,"Andrew Kang, founder and CEO of Mechanism Capital, has shifted his bullish outlook from Dogecoin (DOGE) to First Neiro On Ethereum (NEIRO) following Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the US presidential election. In a series of posts on X on Wednesday, November 6, Kang asserted that NEIRO is poised for exponential growth in the coming months. Better Than Dogecoin? “With a Trump win, NEIRO as the natural successor to Doge is on a path to billions over the next few months,” Kang wrote. He further elaborated, “Hard to think of better coins to hold post a Trump/Elon win than NEIRO. As the natural successor to Doge, its path to a Doge/Shib like run and eventual flippening debates are pre-ordained. Doge is great, but new dogs are even better.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought Kang was among the first industry experts to designate Dogecoin as the premier “Trump trade” in the crypto market—a strategy for investors betting on a Trump victory. On October 15, he noted:  “One of the most interesting ways to express a ‘Trump Victory’ trade would probably be owning DOGE (and other memes). Not only do you have high odds of a Doge ETF but the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would be making headlines every week and be pushed forward by Trump.” This perspective gained traction among several crypto analysts who identified Dogecoin as the leading proxy for anticipating a Trump win. The association stems from Elon Musk’s proposal to lead a “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.) under a Trump administration to reduce the bloated US government spending. Since Kang’s initial post on October 15, the Dogecoin price has surged by over 70%, climbing from $0.1158 to above $0.20 at press time. In contrast, NEIRO experienced a significant downturn of approximately 22% during the same period. After reaching its all-time high of $0.002333 on October 15, NEIRO dipped but has recently shown signs of recovery, rising 42% in the last 48 hours to trade at $0.001786. Related Reading: Why Is Dogecoin Going Up Today? Key Drivers Of DOGE’s 10% Surge Kang’s endorsement of NEIRO has sparked a debate within the crypto community. Crypto analyst Crypto Stream (@CryptoStreamHub) questioned the trend of industry leaders promoting meme coins, commenting under Kang’s post: “When did it become normalized for the industry leaders to shill Memecoins, honest question? Raoul Pal started, yesterday I heard Arthur Hayes shill GOAT and now Kang is shilling NEIRO. Not wanna criticize that, I genuinely wonder when we made the pivot.” Another analyst, CryptoGugu (@Silivabrota), expressed skepticism about NEIRO’s potential and warned of an underlying market manipulation: “Guys please stop comparing NEIRO with DOGE. DOGE is the real deal NEIRO looking more like a liquidity grab scheme right now. Since the mm has been replaced chart looking awful. Mm only going up and down chasing liquidity, whales only dumping. Something needs to change asap or NEIRO will continue bleeding.” At press time, NEIRO traded at $0.001786. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

SOL has recently experienced a 14% increase, which has enabled it to surpass BNB. Related Reading: Why One Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy XRP—Before It Hits $14 This represents an emerging market momentum of Solana. According to Coingecko, the market capitalization of Solana has reached over $87 billion in comparison to that of Binance Coin at almost the $84 billion mark. Thus, this shows the emergence of Solana’s strong appeal to investors. Solana’s most recent ascent has brought it into the limelight, prompting crypto devotees and analysts to contemplate whether this represents a new era for the network. Despite a nearly 4% increase in BNB during the same period, Solana’s rapid recovery and robust community support have eclipsed its rival. Increasing User Engagement and Activity Apart from market size, active participation and complete information on-chain have raised Solana’s price. The network just noted a historic first: 123 million active monthly addresses in October, up 40% from September. According to the latest data, active addresses increased month by month displaying participation and confidence in the promise Solana presented. According to the real-time economic activity reports by Blockworks Research, transaction fees and MEV tips recently peaked at a new all-time-high figure of $11 million on October 24th. These values have remained much above past ones, even though they have fallen somewhat lately. Particularly from regular users and small-scale transactions, the higher use and engagement show the dynamic character of Solana’s ecosystem and its capacity to draw each daily players. Memecoins Add To The Frenzy The memecoin mania has taken off within its network, thereby amplifying trading volume and attracting more users, which has contributed to Solana’s rally. Pump.fun, a memecoin generator, and Raydium, a decentralized exchange, have received substantial attention. Pump.fun generated $30 million in revenue in October. On the other hand, Raydium’s trading volume exceeded $30 billion. Memecoins have been a significant factor in the recent growth of Solana, as a growing number of users are flocking to these platforms to trade or generate meme-based tokens. The emergence of these niche areas has heightened the enthusiasm surrounding Solana, illustrating its adaptability as a blockchain that accommodates both mainstream and unconventional projects.

This is a 25% increase from the previous quarter, which propelled Solana to the position of third largest network by TVL.

Interestingly, this spike has come amid reignited interest in the SHIB price. This surge in activity cuts across the wider industry as traders look to capitalize on the election dynamics.  Aside from Shiba Inu, Dogecoin has also witnessed a surge in trading activity and volume, and it is left to wonder if SHIB will rally alongside the Dogecoin price and reach new all-time highs. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars The burn rate of Shiba Inu is a measure of how much SHIB is permanently removed from circulation by sending it to inactive wallets. This controlled reduction of supply is intended to create scarcity, thereby potentially boosting SHIB’s price.  Related Reading: Analyst Reveals What The Gold Chart Says About The Possibility Of Bitcoin Price Reaching $100,000 According to data from Shibburn.com, SHIB’s burn rate jumped by over 3,674% as voters trooped to vote in the US, an unexpected surge that points to a coordinated effort by the SHIB community. Particularly, Shibburn highlighted that over 53.3 million SHIB tokens were burned in the past 24 hours alone. Interestingly, a further look into the data shows that over 28.8 million SHIB tokens were burned in a single transaction. This uptick in SHIB burns has paralleled a notable increase in its market value, with SHIB climbing as high as 10% in the past 24 hours. This allowed SHIB to go on successive breaks above the $0.000017, $0.000018, $0.000019, and $0.000020 in rapid succession. Despite the notable Shiba Inu price uptick, its meme coin counterpart, Dogecoin, has witnessed more gains. Particularly, Dogecoin is up by about 20% in the last 24 hours, having recently crossed above $0.2 again for the first time since April 2024.  Can SHIB Continue To Surge Alongside Dogecoin? Historically, both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have seen simultaneous price movements, particularly when interest in one coin flows into higher trading volumes for the other. SHIB’s recent burn rate spike adds fuel to the debate over which token might lead in upcoming rallies, especially with DOGE seeing a sustained rise in interest.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? However, as both SHIB and DOGE continue to experience heightened trading activity, both cryptocurrencies are expected to continue on the upswing for the rest of the month. As such, we could see SHIB creating a new 2024 high alongside Dogecoin in November, before both eventually go to challenge their all-time highs. Both SHIB and DOGE have seen slight pullbacks after their recent rallies, likely due to profit-taking as some holders lock in gains before the next possible upswing. At the time of writing, SHIB has found support at $0.0000183, currently trading around $0.0000188, while Dogecoin is holding steady at $0.197 Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

This milestone pushed Bitcoin into price discovery, igniting significant liquidations across trading platforms. Data from CryptoQuant reveals an unprecedented surge in short liquidations, surpassing $100 million within a single one-minute candle, marking a historic moment for BTC. This explosive price action was fueled by the surprise Trump win in the U.S. election, which appears to have sparked renewed enthusiasm for crypto assets as investors respond to the potential economic policies ahead. The election outcome has sent shockwaves through the market, with Bitcoin leading a fresh rally across the crypto space. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? Now in uncharted territory, Bitcoin’s move above $75,000 represents a powerful statement of investor confidence despite broader economic uncertainties. As BTC enters price discovery mode, traders and investors alike are bracing for further volatility, while many anticipate that this momentum could extend into even higher highs. The coming days will be critical as Bitcoin’s price action continues to drive liquidations and shape the outlook for the broader market. Bitcoin Bullish Phase Begins Bitcoin has officially entered a bullish phase, setting new all-time highs following Donald Trump’s election victory. As a known crypto supporter, Trump’s win has spurred market optimism, pushing BTC’s price above previous ATHs in a surge that began as election results favored his lead.  This bullish breakout was accompanied by a dramatic liquidation spike, signaling strong buying pressure as bearish bets were swiftly unwound. Data from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn shows that short liquidations exceeded $100 million in a single one-minute candle—an unprecedented event that underscores the power behind this rally and suggests that Bitcoin’s upward momentum is just beginning. In the coming days, volatility will remain high as global markets digest the election outcome and brace for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Thursday. Investors anticipate a dynamic market response, with possible ripple effects across traditional and crypto markets. Should the Fed keep rates steady or make any dovish adjustments, it could further bolster Bitcoin’s rally and strengthen the broader crypto market.

BTC Visits Uncharted Territory Bitcoin is trading at $73,800 after breaking its previous all-time highs and reaching a new peak of $75,300. This breakout has pushed BTC into uncharted territory, a phase that historically signals massive gains as bullish momentum builds.  The focus is whether Bitcoin can maintain its momentum above the previous ATH of $73,800, a critical support level that could propel it further into new highs if held successfully. However, the timing of this move aligns with a particularly volatile week, as the market anticipates the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting. The Fed’s decision on interest rates could introduce significant unpredictability, potentially tempering BTC’s rise or even sending it below the $70,000 mark if the outcome diverges from market expectations.

According to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, the election’s immediate aftermath has seen a “risk-on rotation” across derivatives, indicating a surge in investor confidence. Bitcoin Options Market Targets $80,000 By Late November On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the basis—the difference between the spot market price and futures contract prices—has risen sharply from 7% to over 15% in a single day, reflecting heightened interest from institutional investors.

Analysts Predict Strong ETF Inflows Post-Election Michael Safai, founding partner at quantitative trading firm Dexterity Capital, told Bloomberg that Trump’s administration promises decreased regulatory intervention in the US, a development many crypto investors have advocated during previous years of heightened scrutiny. While exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by Bitcoin experienced one of the largest outflows on Monday, Safai suggests that traders remain optimistic about a potential reversal.  Lunde also indicated that the European trading session had been relatively quiet. Still, Bitcoin appears to be finding support at its former all-time highs, a positive sign for continued upward momentum. Anticipating strong ETF inflows during US trading hours on Wednesday, the analyst expects the combination of rising CME premiums and post-election clarity to bolster Bitcoin’s performance. “The backdrop of burgeoning CME premiums presents carry opportunities that should support strong performance,” Lunde explained. However, amidst the positive outlook, some traders advise caution regarding potential price corrections. Related Reading: Uniswap Surges Toward $8.74 – Can UNI Push Through To New Heights?

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Uniswap Surges Toward $8.74 – Can UNI Push Through To New Heights?,2024-11-06 17:30:43+00:00,"Uniswap (UNI) is riding a wave of renewed bullish momentum, with its price inching closer to the critical $8.74 resistance level. This surge has captured the attention of investors eager to see if UNI can overcome this hurdle and unlock fresh upside potential. As the market sentiment shifts more positively, the $8.74 level is a pivotal strength test for Uniswap’s rally.  This article uncovers the dynamics behind Uniswap’s climb toward $8.74, evaluating if this resistance level could be the gateway to further gains. We’ll examine the key technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential challenges to determine if UNI’s bullish momentum can sustain a breakout, positioning it for a move to higher levels. What’s Driving The Recent Uniswap Surge? After rebounding from the $6.742 support level, UNI has displayed robust bullish momentum, pushing decisively above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. The move indicates a strong shift in sentiment as buyers regain control, propelling Uniswap toward the critical $8.748 resistance mark. Now approaching this resistance, UNI is testing the resilience of its upward strength, with a breakthrough possibly paving the way for additional gains and establishing a new higher trading range. Also, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis highlights renewed upside potential, with the RSI climbing from the oversold zone to above the 50% threshold. Now sitting at 85%, this upward movement suggests a strong increase in buying pressure, signaling a shift from the previous bearish phase toward a more neutral and potentially optimistic outlook. Related Reading: Uniswap Rallies In Bearish Conditions, Can UNI Break New Grounds? Additionally, the daily chart shows Uniswap is on a solid upward trajectory, underscored by a strong bullish candlestick that reflects sustained buying pressure. UNI’s position above the 100-day SMA further supports this positive price action, reinforcing the likelihood of continued gains. Trading consistently above this key SMA signals strengthening positive sentiment, as buyers maintain control and push the price toward higher levels, possibly setting the stage for a test of upcoming resistance zones. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart has risen to 67%, recovering from a previous dip to 37%. If the RSI continues to climb, it could indicate growing strength in UNI’s price action. Additionally, staying above the 60% level would significantly boost the chances of sustained bullish momentum and potential breakouts, further reinforcing the asset’s positive sentiment. Resistance Or Launchpad? What $8.74 Means For UNI’s Future The $8.74 level for Uniswap represents a critical point of resistance determining the next phase of its price movement. If UNI can break through this barrier, it could act as a launchpad for further gains, with the $10 mark and beyond becoming attainable targets as the upbeat pressure accelerates. Related Reading: UNI Price Bounces Back 13% Above $5.6, Can Bulls Maintain Control?

Donald Trump will get a second term, defeating Kamala Harris. In the midst of election night, the Bitcoin price rose to a new all-time high of $75,407 on Binance. The euphoria is driven by Trump’s big election promises. He wants to establish Bitcoin as a national strategic stockpile, fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler and generally enforce a crypto-friendly policy. While a Harris victory would have meant a short-term setback for Bitcoin according to most experts, the predictions by the majority of experts are extremely bullish thanks to the Trump victory. However, renowned economist Henrik Zeberg offers a cautionary perspective. Zeberg warns that Trump’s proposed economic policies could precipitate a US recession, leading to a “blow-off top” scenario for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Central to his argument is Trump’s plan to replace certain taxes with tariffs to stimulate domestic economic growth. Is A Bitcoin Blow-Off Top Scenario Looming? Drawing parallels with historical events, Zeberg suggests that Trump’s tariff strategy could echo the economic missteps of the 1920s and 1930s.

US Tariffs implemented into a Recession—reinforcing the downturn and popping the Greatest Bubble ever.” Related Reading: Analyst Reveals What The Gold Chart Says About The Possibility Of Bitcoin Price Reaching $100,000 The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act is widely regarded as a catalyst that deepened the Great Depression. By substantially increasing US tariffs on imported goods, the act prompted retaliatory tariffs from other nations, leading to a severe contraction in international trade. This protectionist spiral exacerbated global economic decline, resulting in heightened unemployment and prolonged hardship worldwide. Amid these economic concerns, Zeberg has projected a significant, yet potentially short-lived, surge in Bitcoin’s price. “Making it Simple! BTC target 115-123K,” he asserted via X a few days ago. His analysis is grounded in Fibonacci extension levels—a technical analysis tool used to predict future price movements based on historical price patterns. Related Reading: Institutional Traders Bet On Bitcoin Exceeding $79,300 By End Of November According to Zeberg’s analysis, the critical level to monitor is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, calculated at $114,916.16. He suggests that this level is “very likely the top,” indicating that Bitcoin could reach this price point before experiencing a significant reversal. The analysis also notes other key Fibonacci levels that may serve as resistance points during Bitcoin’s ascent. The 0.382 level at $77,437.88 marks a significant initial resistance following the breakout from the previous all-time high. The 0.618 level at $85,205.47 could act as minor resistance as the price climbs. Additionally, the 1.0 level at $107,435.71 represents a crucial psychological and technical threshold, while the 1.27 level at $123,148.19 indicates a possible overshoot beyond the primary target zone. An annotation on Zeberg’s chart poses the question, “58% in less than 3 months into the top?” This suggests he anticipates a rapid price increase within a relatively short time frame, consistent with historical patterns. At press time, BTC traded at $73,742. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Grab Ethereum Now? Expert Says Next Stop Could Be $10,000 After ‘Final Drop’",2024-11-06 15:00:29+00:00,"Ethereum analysts are keeping a close look at the altcoin, which is stuck in a long downtrend. Some call for major upward breakout and others keep a cautious stance, warning to expect this downtrend will continue. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, is optimistic about the coin’s price trajectory, stating Ether would hit $10,000 in the coming bull run. Related Reading: Six Months, $1 Billion: TON Network’s Explosive USDT Adoption Milestone Martinez, whose research often links ETH with more general market movements, has compared Ethereum’s rise with that of the S&P 500, suggesting that a similar breakout might be just ahead. Nevertheless, not all individuals are satisfied with this optimistic outlook. Peter Brandt, another crypto expert, maintains an alternative perspective. Brandt, who is renowned for his technical expertise and precise predictions, has issued a cautionary note regarding a robust bearish pattern on the daily chart of ETH. In his most recent analysis, he emphasizes a “bearish flag”—a descending channel—that he believes indicates potential additional downside risk. The Stock Market Connection Martinez has grounded his case on the historical relationship between Ethereum and the S&P 500 (SPX). Examining ETH in tandem with SPX Martinez noted that both assets had a bottom in late 2022 and kept an increasing trend until 2023. #Ethereum $ETH has been mimicking the S&P500, and this could be the last dip before it triples and hits $10,000! pic.twitter.com/BgpbZQXM6I — Ali (@ali_charts) November 4, 2024 Based on the S&P 500 performance recently, he believes this alignment indicates ETH is preparing for a similar breakout. Martinez believes ETH might follow a similar trajectory, perhaps reaching the elusive $10,000 mark as the S&P 500 somewhat sank after its breakthrough to roughly $5,900. If such a trend is to follow through, then Ethereum needs a push to around 310% higher than the market price today. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $2,618, up 8% in the last 24 hours. Martinez is cheerful about it, especially taking into account the development coming into the broader market perspective, although the objective has a very steep curve; however, Brandt’s warning is that ETH journey might not be as facile as envisioned, especially at the emergence of bearish signals. A Blend Of Signals The on-chain data from IntoTheBlock indicates that Ethereum holders have a divided sentiment. At present, nearly 23% of active addresses that hold ETH are in advantageous positions, which indicates that these holders are “in the money.” Although this implies that there is support at a certain level, the break-even level of 60% of the portfolios implies that the market remains uncertain. The holding by these individuals will determine how to buy more units or sell them in case of either a rise or drop in the price of Ethereum during the next weeks. More Losses Ahead? Veteran trader Peter Brandt warns that ETH’s bearish trend is severe and improbable to turn around. Brandt lately saw ETH’s daily chart’s negative predominance and projected more losses. Interesting to note that there was not a buy signal in $ETH In fact, chart remains bearish with unmet target at 1551 pic.twitter.com/sjkXyTQXU2 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 31, 2024 October 31 saw seasoned analyst Brandt, known for his accurate forecasts, draw attention to Ethereum’s bearish trend on X (formerly Twitter). ETH’s one-day chart starting in August has indicated a declining trend. This “bearish flag” indicates that the fall will keep on. Brandt saw no Ethereum purchase signals or momentum changes. His negative view contradicts with the rally forecasts of speculators. Since the chart shows no reversal, Brandt thinks ETH’s price may fall below current support levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Costs Spike To Nearly $50K As Miners Look To AI For Survival A Differing Perspective Although both are highly contradictory in terms of their opinions, the analysis by Martinez and Brandt of what is likely to happen in the subsequent phases of Ethereum has revealed such unpredictability. Ether is seen to continue its rise upward like that of S&P 500 toward $10,000. On the other hand, a similar cautionary tale given out by Brandt suggests that even in the future, difficulties may lie ahead due to the continuous presence of downward forces.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price Touches $75,000 ATH: Analyst Says This Is What You Should Expect Next",2024-11-06 14:00:29+00:00,"The Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high (ATH) as it surged past $73,700 and rose to as high as $75,000 on November 6. Following this development, crypto analyst Tony Severino has revealed what to expect next from the flagship crypto.  Bitcoin Price Ready For “Fireworks” After New ATH In an X post, Tony Severino indicated that the Bitcoin price is ready to experience a parabolic rally, as he told market participants to expect fireworks above $75,000. The crypto analyst also revealed that Bitcoin was approaching the 2-week upper Bollinger Band while the bands are the tightest in history according to the BBWidth.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? The accompanying chart, which the crypto analyst shared, showed that the Bitcoin price could rise to as high as $140,000, with the flagship crypto reaching a potential market top in 2025. Tony Severino had previously mentioned that Bitcoin was approaching the strongest part of the bull run and explained how, based on historical trends, BTC could rise to as high as $133,000.  Indeed, the Bitcoin price looks to be entering the strongest part of the bull run following its rise to a new all-time high. This recent price rally to a new ATH is thanks to Donald Trump, who has been elected to become the next US president. This provides a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market since the US president-elect has publicly declared his support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Besides Trump coasting to victory, it is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin price has historically never been below the levels it was at on US presidential election days. Therefore, this is likely the lowest range the flagship crypto might trade at before it records the next parabolic leg of this bull run.  A Fed Rate Cut Is Also On The Way In addition to Donald Trump’s victory, some other catalysts are lined up to spark the next leg of the Bitcoin bull run. One is a possible Fed rate cut that is expected to come on November 7, which is bullish for the Bitcoin price. The US Federal Reserve begins its FOMC meeting today and will decide on a rate cut by tomorrow.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought CME Fedwatch data shows a 97.6% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps). This provides a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price as more capital is set to flow into its ecosystem. Institutional investors are also on the sidelines as they will likely invest more money in the Spot Bitcoin ETFs after the US elections and a Fed rate cut.  At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $74,500, up over 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,solana,Took the biggest bet and Lost - Hardest lesson,2024-11-07 00:46:00,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my story here. It’s been a rough year, and maybe my mistakes will help others avoid similar pitfalls.

I’ve been in crypto since 2015, starting with ETH at $150 and Solana at $9, riding out every high and low. Earlier this year, I decided to allocate my personal SOL holdings to various meme projects, just to see where it could take me. I knew the risks, but I thought I could handle it after years of experience.

Later on, end of September, I took out a $50k consumer loan, determined to make some safer, more stable plays. I put that money into what I genuinely believe are safe meme tokens: $FWOG, $HEHE, $XD, and $WAWA. I was confident in these choices and felt that the loan would be worth it with time.

But then leverage trading caught my attention. I started small, allocating $2,500 to experiment, but I quickly lost that amount. Rather than stepping back, I went all-in, convincing myself that I could handle the risk. I spent hours analyzing indexes, and soon I began pulling funds out of my “safe” meme token investments and into leveraged positions, believing I’d timed the bottom perfectly.

For a moment, it looked like I’d made it – my positions barely avoided liquidation, and I managed to close with around $100k. I moved most of it back into stable meme holdings, feeling a huge sense of relief. I had $77k secured  in my private and another $40k set aside in the loan account.

But that high was temporary. The allure of leverage called me back. And this time, the market wasn’t forgiving. My positions didn’t dodge liquidation. I lost it all – the biggest hit I’ve ever taken, over $115k gone, evaporated.

And all this happened within a single month. I got so caught up chasing numbers, completely losing perspective. I became delusional, almost numb to how much I was risking and how easily I was discarding money. In the frenzy, I forgot to step back and see the bigger picture because everything felt like it needed to happen fast.

Looking back, I realize I let my confidence and impulse get the best of me. If I’d stuck to my safer plays, I’d be in a very different position. I’m sharing this here as a reminder – sometimes the safest bet is staying disciplined and simply doing nothing but hold",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Back in Jan - Feb I looked at JUP and RAY and was sold on everything I read and watched about JUP being the new superior tech. The uniswap of Solana.   I watched them both rally in March until they ultimately crashed back down.  

Reading the community sentiment, I continued stacking JUP.  But where has that lead me haha.  Aside from the great tokenomics of the supposedly ‘clunky old tech’ that is supposed to be RAY,  will Jupiter get its moment in the sun? Because the election green candles have only brought us back to sweet fuck all while I’m watching RAY go almost 4x from a couple months ago.  ",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into Solana, and I’m really enjoying the learning process—there’s a lot of great material out there! I’ve also briefly checked out a few job listings to get a sense of the market. 

I'm curious to learn more about the current state of Solana development:  
\- What types of projects are most common?  
\- What salary range should I expect as a Solana developer?  
\- Is the job market competitive right now?  
\- How are funding opportunities looking for new projects?

Reddit,solana,Confused about dApp computing fees,2024-11-06 15:58:33,"Hey guyz. Im new in blockchain development and just sitting on my taughts how should i do my website. I know there are transaction fees and other fees, but not sure for me how actually its working. I wont make a lottery but i saw a good app development video about it and we can use as an example. 

So if i call the main program (start a lottery event to people can join) i pay fee for it. An external wallet calls the program. 
Than people pay the entry price plus the fee for being accounted to the lottery event. 
At the end there is a fee for payout transaction (we can declare if it payed by the pool or program account or by user via request). Thats ok. 

What is up with the calculation? For example there are 100 people who joined to the event and i wont calculate the winner on my backend but i let it do to a blockchain function. How much fee will it generate? 100x the accounts datas?

Or another example. I see this fps games connected to the blockchain because of high computing speed. How much the computing costs? How it worth for the devs? Because if onchain computing costs nothing because the program and the computable datas also on the blockchain im happy, but it seems unrelistic for me.

Thanks guyz",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034
Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-11-06 09:50:52,"

📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,solana,📉 Traders to Avoid When Copy Trading on Solana:,2024-11-05 07:21:35,"
1. Scalper Traders: Their trades typically last less than a minute, making it unprofitable to copy them with free copy trading bots due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)

2. Traders with Numerous Buys: If a trader makes more than 4-5 buys, it becomes challenging to manage money effectively. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your deposit per trade and the trader makes 7-9 buys of a scam token, you could lose 70-90% of your assets.

3. Mixed Token Traders: These traders receive tokens from other wallets and also purchase tokens themselves. Their profit and loss (PnL) on trades may be higher than yours due to tokens received from external sources.

4. Token snipers: These traders buy tokens at the start of their market appearance (first candle). Using free copy trading bots with them can lead to losses due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,solana,Realization or epiphany of my expectations for profits,2024-11-04 09:35:44,"Hey folks, so, random thought, but after losing a little bit of money this past week trying to trade memecoins for massive gains, I realized, I'm setting my expectations too high.

I make $20/hr at the farm I work on, that works out to $0.333333333333333 a minute. 

So if I start using a something like bonkbot, watching the one second chart, and sniping the spikes and drops, so long as I'm making $0.33/$0.34 a minute, I'm making as much as I do at my job. 

Instead of watching my small plays go up by even just $2-$10, then not executing my sales because I'm wanting more, that I'm being silly. 

So long as I'm covering priority fees, accounting for slippage as well as price impact, I should just be using a bot to take any profits at all. If I'm making anything over $0.33/$0.34 a minute, and put in a few hours a day, that's still bringing in money I didn't have, and will leave me better off than waiting for a moonshot, and missing my sell targets, ending up taking losses.

Anyways, that's my random 5:30AM epiphany. 

Call me a ""brokie"", which would be accurate, but I think sticking with lower expectations, making lots of small trades with a bot, will be much better for me than hoping to catch a moonshot, and ending up losing on a bunch of trades.

Hope this helps someone else with their strategy as well who's in a position like mine.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-11-04 04:39:49,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,solana,Educational Post - Wallet security - Solclaim scam possibilities. - MUST READ FOR ALL,2024-11-03 15:14:49,"Hey everyone,

I want to make an **important post** regarding the recent hype around services like *""solclaim""* and similar offerings.

Today, I received a message from a random user on Telegram. They sent me a referral link to a Telegram bot claiming that you could enter your private keys and get **""free"" Solana**. *Here’s how to think about this:*

>***Imagine giving your house key to someone who can unlock every door in your home. You have no way of locking them out and wouldn’t even know if they were inside your house. Now, imagine the whole neighborhood giving this same person access, just because some received a few dollars in return. Would you really hand over your keys? Sounds crazy, right?***

Let me break down what’s happening here, as many investors **trust too easily** in this space.

**First of all, the Solana you are claiming was yours all along.** Every NFT or token you’ve traded incurs a small rent fee in SOL. You can reclaim this rent, which is typically around 20-40 cents per token. *Reclaiming this rent is easy and convenient*, especially since we don’t hold onto every token we’ve ever traded.

**The problem arises when people trust Telegram bots or shady websites with their private keys.** As someone with experience in developing Telegram bots, I can tell you that these bots are **99.99% likely** to log your private keys in a database.

You might be thinking, *“Who would actually trust this? Who would hand over their private key just to get some free SOL?”* The answer is: **more than 10,000 people**. Aggressive marketing tactics are everywhere. While I won’t outright say they’re stealing private keys and draining wallets, even if they do this to just one large wallet a week, it’s a **huge problem**—and trust me, it’s *incredibly easy* for them to do.

**Once your private key is compromised, it doesn’t matter how long it’s been.** You might forget that you handed it over months ago. Then, after making some big trades and seeing success, you wake up one day to find your funds are gone.

**And here’s the kicker: You can’t prove it was these services.** They have plenty of ways to deflect blame:

* Claim a hacker accessed your phone or PC.
* Suggest you connected your wallet to a malicious site in the past.
* Insist you made the transaction yourself, because on the blockchain, it will look that way.
* Assert that they would never steal your private keys and show off certifications (*it only takes three lines of code to log everything sent to a Telegram bot*).
* Accuse you of being a hater trying to tarnish their reputation.

**TL;DR:**  
*Never, ever share your private keys with anyone.* If you send them out, even once, it’s risky to trust anyone with such sensitive information, especially if you still use those wallets. While these services may not be mass-scamming (*which would be too obvious*), even targeting just a few large wallets is enough to cause significant harm.

There are safe options for reclaiming your SOL rent—**always use wallet connections for this**. Stay vigilant and protect your assets.

Please, be careful, and **never share your private keys. Ever.**

*Have a great rest of your day!*

Reddit,solana,🚀 Wen Bull Run? I Built a One-Stop Dashboard for Degen Market Research,2024-11-02 11:48:26,"Hey anon degens, I got tired of jumping between 69 different sites and pages to check the market vibes, so I built a fun little site called [wenbullrun.com](https://wenbullrun.com/) as a side project – a no-bs dashboard that tells you if we're still eating ramen or if lambos are back on the menu.

Essentially, I've carefully picked some of the most reliable bull run indicators and put them all in one place. Every metric on here serves one purpose: helping you figure out if the bulls are finally back or if we're still hibernating with the bears.

What you get:

* Price action for BTC/ETH/SOL with historical comparisons (7d, 30d, 90d)
* Market dominance tracking (is BTC still king or are the alts gaining ground?)
* Quarterly Crypto VC data showing total deals and investment volume (is it crypto funding winter or summer?)
* Google Trends data (are normies searching ""bitcoin"" again?)
* Coinbase app ranking (tracking retail FOMO in real-time)
* Fear & Greed index with key values and historical averages (because emotions rule over degens)

Everything is automated except the VC investment data (which I update manually because degens need fresh hopium).

No signup required, and no ads, just charts and vibes where you can focus purely on the trend.

📈 Coming Soon:

* M2 Money Supply tracking (money printer go brrr?)
* More suggestions from you degenerates

This is just v1, and I'd love your feedback. What other features or metrics would help you ape more intelligently? What features would make this your go-to dashboard?

Build in public, learn in public.

Reddit,ethereum,Exploring Custom/OpenSource Hardware Wallets,2024-11-05 03:36:14,"Hey! I am looking for any useful information on creating a custom hardware wallet. The idea is to get something like a programmable USB stick with two buttons and a screen (imagine a Ledger), but where I will be able to customize the code. The goal is fairly simple: to make it possible for anyone to have full control of their hardware wallets. Lots of beneficial products could come from this; for example, in gaming arcades, hardware wallets could provide you with identity.

One of the problems with Ledger is that they are closed source, and as we found out not long ago—not really ""our"" keys, as they can export them (no thank you).

If anyone has any knowledge on this, I'd really appreciate it, and if anyone wants to work on this with me to achieve such hardware, that would be amazing too! I run a Web3 company and am a developer myself, and can provide funding as well.

Reddit,ethereum,Some of the Ethereum-related content I've found interesting last week,2024-11-04 17:53:44,"hey, I've been curating an [Ethereum-focused newsletter](https://paragraph.xyz/@kiwi-weekly/kiwi-news-recap-69) for over a year now, and I thought I'd share here the most interesting reads of the week.

Reddit,ethereum,Market risk of a 51% attack on Polymarket,2024-11-02 22:18:06,"Over the past few days, I did a deep dive into Polymarket's implementation and the current state of the market. Here’s what I’ve found:

UMA is a cryptocurrency protocol that created a system to verify statement accuracy (e.g., 'Trump won the 2024 election'), which they call their 'Optimistic Oracle'. An 'Asserter' can post (assert) this information to the network, staking some cryptocurrency (any approved ERC20 token) alongside the assertion. Anyone who wants to dispute it (the 'Disputer') may do so, typically by matching the Asserter's stake. If a dispute happens, the process escalates to the 'Data Verification Mechanism' (DVM). When it reaches DVM, the tokenholders of UMA decide by vote how the assertion should resolve (i.e., ultimately whether the Asserter or the Disputer receives the staked currencies). They do this with one vote per UMA token.

Polymarket operates as a separate contract on the blockchain that interacts with UMA. The API allows users to create betting markets, bet on them, and perform various tasks. The Polymarket API also allows users to propose and dispute the outcomes of the betting markets when they end, costing about $750 to assert, and then another $750 to dispute. If there is a dispute, it gets escalated to UMA's DVM system. Disputes rarely happen because the DVM works. Typically, nobody has any incentive to lose their $750. This clever solution allows them to run a completely decentralized betting market that cannot be shut down.

However, the market cap of UMA is only about $200m as of writing this post. A 51% attacker would need to own approximately $100m worth of it. It is my understanding that any single person and/or collaborative group of people with such a quantity of UMA could then purchase and dispute one side of every contract on Polymarket, vote in favor of themselves during the DVM for each of them, and win every bet. Doing this would destroy their $100m of UMA, but they'll potentially make more from the bets.

A quick browse of Polymarket shows an order book with quite a few contracts readily available for purchase, many of them priced at 0.1 cents which can pay out $1 to an attacker (1000x). It's difficult to determine exactly how much an attacker could make on Polymarket because it depends on a lot of factors and a moving market. But a 51% attacker might attempt something like this on the ""Presidential Election Winner 2024"" market ( https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024 ):

* Buy ""Yes"" on Chris Christie. $0.001. Buy 72 million shares right now for $72k.
* Buy ""No"" on Trump over a few weeks or months. $0.42. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $42m
* Buy ""No"" on Kamala over a few weeks or months. $0.58. Maybe accumulate 100 million shares for $58m
* Accept the loss of $100m worth of UMA due to the price collapsing

**This would cost roughly $200m and make $272m.** They could make a bit more on the smaller betting markets as well. There's only about $670m of USDC on the Polygon network in total, which puts a hard limit on how much money exists in these contracts.

At the moment, at least, someone on these markets betting that Chris Christie is 99.9% likely to lose is not correctly pricing in the risk of a 51% attack on UMA.

There is a different play for someone with a lot more money and power to 51% attack UMA, and that would be to gain favor with Trump by using their 51% to decide Trump wins on the betting markets. It could be used to help the publicity battle that Trump will fight if he doesn't clearly win the election.

I would guess there's not quite enough money to be made just yet to justify a risky, expensive attempt to do a 51% attack on UMA, in large part because acquiring the 51% over the last few years would have cost the attacker a lot more than $100m (see historic prices). If anyone already did this, they're probably planning to hold on for something bigger. I'd put a small non-zero chance on a malicious actor already having acquired 51%.

So, in conclusion, the current market seems to be teetering on the edge. If UMA's market cap doesn't rise as fast as Polymarket's betting markets, Polymarket may need to switch to a voting network that they have 51% control over, or some other system that can't be readily abused.

Reddit,ethereum,I would like to make my final year university project related to Ethereum but I'm struggling to think of ideas,2024-11-02 16:58:29,"Specifically, my supervisor has instructed me that my project has to be related to the theme of cryptoeconomics and ""to analyse and extract information about the strategic behaviour of users and miners to help with the design of more efficient market-regulating mechanisms"". More specifically, it was suggested that I could do a project on PBS but this is a suggestion more than a rule.

That being said, past year's projects have related to credit ratings, fraud detection and someone else this year is doing a project on the correlation of cryptocurrency prices to traditional finance indicies (I was thinking of proposing this but it appeard too simple).

I had proposed the building of a basic MEV bot but I'm not sure if this would be too complex an undertaking over 2 semesters (6 months) and my supervisor didn't have a lot to say as this was an area that he wasn't too familiar with. Furthermore, while the project isn't prohibited and I won't lose marks or anything, there was the idea that the project would be a bit more research oriented and this is more on the developer side. One thing my supervisor mentioned is that novelty isn't a requirement and if I were to proceed with this project, I don't need a crazy original strategy.

I have a few other ideas too: Something to do with climate i.e. comparing emissions of various currencies or investigating the environmental effect of the Ethereum merge.

I hope that makes sense, I'd appreciate any feedback on the feasibility of the above ideas and if you guys had any suggestions of your own.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,ethereum,18 days activation queue on Holesky?! Something big is brewing in ETH staking 🤔,2024-11-01 13:56:14,"https://preview.redd.it/kwfa1wk1payd1.png?width=2824&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf194f89d8043bde3deb46912a04e4eb4cbbaffb

Okay, this is weird. I just tried to set up a validator on Holesky testnet and noticed I'd have to wait 18 DAYS for activation. Double-checked the queue - there are [32,033 validators ](https://holesky.beaconcha.in)waiting. On a testnet! Something's definitely cooking...

What's even more interesting is that this massive queue started forming right after EIP-7002 (the beacon state root in the EVM proposal) hit the testnet. For those not familiar, this proposal essentially enables smart contracts to verify beacon chain state, which is crucial for many staking innovations.

Looking through some GitHub discussions and Discord channels, I've noticed a lot of activity around:

* DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) implementations
* Restaking protocols
* Liquid staking solutions
* New staking pool mechanisms

I'm particularly intrigued by the DVT testing activities because of the recent Lido simpleDVT and CSM discussions about implementing validator splitting into DVT solutions. Seeing projects like SSV and others actively testing on Holesky makes me wonder if we're closer to seeing production-ready DVT implementations than we think.

Anyone else noticed this unusual testnet activity? What do you think is being tested at such scale?",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034
Reddit,ethereum,Aggregation & atomization: dependency funding round dynamics,2024-11-01 18:28:23,"New article: Aggregation & atomization: dependency funding round dynamics

**>>>>>>>> read the** [**full piece**](https://trent.mirror.xyz/ia1sSXWw6Q_0gseWhPDpt0WbsOadCfQ-23yAxNn4sXA), summary below  
  
The term “public goods” has been diluted - “dependency” might be better. Round-based funding mechanisms incentivize atomization - how can we avoid this?

We have failed to develop standards of rigor for the use of the ""public goods"" term. When it applies to everything, it describes nothing. “Dependency” is better for the Ethereum software ecosystem: crucial bits of infrastructure not directly maintained by an actor.

Recurring Funding Rounds come with tradeoffs  
  
\- attention games  
\- eligibility scoping  
\- high expectations of evaluators  
\- atomization incentive

Reflecting on OP Retro Round 5  
  
\- incentivizing atomization  
\- Legibility is not impact  
\- Stewardship is less legible - for good reason

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum won't reach real adoption until we solve the mobile wallets problem.,2024-10-31 14:25:40,"# Here’s a quick story “from the trenches”. 

**First a bit of context:**

I guess most people here use crypto primarily via desktop wallets (like MetaMask). So you don’t use crypto the way you’d use Cash App or Revolut for everyday payments or 10 small txs per day.

But the truth is that people spend most of their non-work time on mobiles, scrolling YouTube, Instagram, or WhatsApp. So, if we want Ethereum to reach significant consumer adoption, our mobile experiences must be great because this is what people are used to, and troubleshooting stuff on mobile is very irritating. Plus most people in Asia and Africa are mobile-first. 

**Why do I even talk about it?**

So we've been building Kiwi for like 1.5 yrs. Our idea has been to stay open and Ethereum-aligned. This means that we haven’t set up “Sign in with Google” or embedded wallets powered by Privy, Capsule, and others. We haven’t even built an Android or Apple app - we have a PWA app so that everyone can use it.

Since our app is primarily focused on people reading and discussing Ethereum-related content, the mobile experience is very important for us. But unfortunately, mobile wallets just don’t work.

I've been flying around the world to attend conferences - from Istanbul to LA and saw people getting onboarded to our app. They used Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Metamask and many other wallets. 

Metamask basically doesn't work most of the time. Rainbow sometimes breaks down, too. Coinbase wallet used to be the best, but now they redirect people to create a passkey wallet, which is confusing.

And it’s not only Kiwi - many users have similar problems on established apps like Zora. Some just say: “Ah yeah, it’s normal. I will figure it out once I get in front of my laptop”. Can you imagine trying to onboard users to your app in these circumstances?

Last year, my co-founder even made a viral thread about testing different mobile wallets, and since then, not a lot has changed: [https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753](https://x.com/timdaub/status/1673591390687690753)

And it’s not that the Ethereum community doesn’t care about the UX. Vitalik even said at one of his talks: “We should be as decentralized and open as Linux and Android, and at the same time have as consistent a user experience as Apple.”

But if Steve Jobs were still alive and saw what the hell is going on with our mobile wallet connections, he'd just ban crypto wallets from AppStore forever.

Wallets are something that needs to work 99.9999% of the time. You can't build consumer crypto apps - and have real adoption - when wallets work 80% of the time. But this is the sad reality that’s making the adoption much harder.

And the reason everyone is so excited about embedded wallets is because they go around these obvious bugs. But it's not a solution either because the dapp gets the vendor locked in, and the user has to create and send money to a new wallet without his identity and onchain history. And the whole idea is to have your ENS and onchain history in one place, in your hot wallet. 

The question is, why does it keep happening? Maybe because it's just complex - people use different browsers - from Firefox, through Chrome up to Opera - and wallets must be compatible with all of them. But then, how do the desktop wallets work 99.99% of the time?

If we had solved the Merge, I imagine we would have found a way to connect mobile wallets reliably. But it’s been 1.5 years now, and this mobile wallet connectivity problem is still omnipresent.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,ethereum,Best practices for Anonymous Crypto Payment System With User Tracking and Minimal Gas Fee,2024-10-31 08:42:02,"Hello! I'm looking to implement a crypto payment system where users can deposit funds without logging in—ideally through a simple QR code scan or by pasting a wallet address. However, I still need a way to track each user and monitor their total deposits. 
The main requirements are: 
1. Users deposit anonymously without requiring login. 
2. The system needs to associate each deposit with a specific user ID for tracking purposes. 
3. I want to know how much each user has deposited over time. 
4. Ideally, I’d like to minimize gas fees and avoid dust deposits. 

Questions: 
1. Has anyone implemented a similar system or found ways to make anonymous deposits work while tracking users reliably? 
2. When scanning the QR code in MetaMask, the metadata field appears empty. Has anyone encountered this issue, and is there a workaround to pass data reliably with the QR code?
3. Would using smart contracts be feasible in this context? If so, how could I reduce gas fees and avoid creating dust amounts?

Insanely high gas fees for a single transaction using Trust Wallet,2024-10-30 17:23:51,"Yesterday I tried to make a payment, so I bought some USDC on Ethereum network and sent it to my Trust Wallet. I moved $650$ worth of USDC and paid about $4-5 in gas fee for the transaction. No biggie.

I decided to not make the payment after all, and now I want to send back the USDC so I can sell them, but TrustWallet wants over $130 of gas fees. (UPDATE: IT'S OVER 270 NOW.)

How is this possible? Am I doing something wrong? How could the transaction cost about $4 yesterday and over $130 today? 

Btw I checked multiple times during the day and the cost was always insanely high.

I mean I understand gas fees are dependant on congestion of ETH network but $130 for a single transaction?

How can I get my money back to Revolut without losing almost $140 just for sending it back and forth? This is insanity.

On Trust Wallet there are multiple options of selling my USDC directly but I don't know if they are trustworthy(MoonPay or Ramp).

EDIT:
The fee is about $270 now. 😂😂 
Seriously, is Trust Wallet a scam? Am I overlooking something?

Even Swapping my USDC to ETH costs about $270. How could it cost 5$ yesterday, same ETH network, and today 270?

If someone has any idea how to help me get my money back without paying these insane fees, I will send him/her like $20 or so. Thank you.

Reddit,ethereum,Zerion Wallet SWAP Redirected My Funds to an Unknown Address – Intentional Scam or Security Flaw?,2024-10-29 14:52:09,"I’m posting this because **Zerion** wallet just cost me funds in what looks like either a major UI failure or worse: an intentional setup to siphon funds. After following **Zerion**’s instructions step-by-step, my swap transaction directed my assets to a **mystery address** without delivering any of the tokens I was supposed to receive. Here’s the rundown – and I’m curious if anyone else has seen their funds vanish this way.

# What Happened:

I attempted to **swap 160 SPX6900 for SOL** using **Zerion**, which recommended **1inch** as the swap provider. I followed the process exactly, hitting the **big SWAP button** multiple times until finally clicking **Sign and Send after the transaction had been verified safe by Zerion.** But instead of completing the swap, my funds were sent to an unknown address, leaving me with nothing in return.

# My Attempts to Resolve This:

* **The Support Deflection**: I sent **Zerion** the transaction hashes, multiple screenshots showing I used “**SWAP**” at each step, and even a full screen recording of the process. Their response? **“It looks like you accidentally chose ‘Send’ instead.”** Ridiculous. **Zerion** then claimed they couldn’t locate the transaction in their system, but that doesn’t explain why their UI sent my funds somewhere else.
* **External Verification**: After contacting **1inch**, they confirmed the swap was never initiated on their end, suggesting the issue is entirely with **Zerion**. **Zerion**’s UI directly led my assets to an unknown address, which they now disavow.

# My Concerns:

* **Is This Intentional?** The support deflection has me wondering if this is part of a deliberate strategy by **Zerion**. Directing funds to a side wallet that gathers small, seemingly “lost” amounts could easily go unnoticed or be written off by most users who don’t want the hassle. It feels like a setup, especially given the vague responses and deflection tactics I’m seeing.
* **Security Issue or Scam?** If **Zerion**’s swap function can so easily redirect funds without fulfilling the swap, how many other users have been unknowingly impacted? And what accountability is **Zerion** planning to take here? So far its been none. The burden of proof has fallen on me, the user, and even with providing ample evidence they remain willfully obtuse.
* **Passing the Burden**: When I pushed for answers, **Zerion** suggested I **risk more funds** to “reproduce the issue.” As if losing more money would magically solve this? This is a clear attempt to dodge responsibility instead of addressing the serious flaw (or scam) in their system.

If this is a UI bug, a security vulnerability, or worse an intentional scam **Zerion** needs to be held accountable, not sidestep responsibility and accountability. We’re trusting platforms like **Zerion** with our assets, and they have a duty to ensure their UI isn’t leading users straight into financial loss.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

I made an ETH transfer to my Trezor, but I made a mistake by choosing the BEP-20 (BSC) network, which is not supported by Trezor. The transfer should have been made via the Ethereum (ERC-20) network.

To try to recover the funds, I set up a wallet in MetaMask connected to the BNB Chain. In BscScan, the transaction appears as confirmed, and the balance is correct and at the address.

I then transferred BNB to the same address to cover the transaction fees. I also added the BNB Chain network to MetaMask and imported the Binance-Peg ETH token using the contract

After restarting the application and checking the network, the assets still do not appear in MetaMask.

Reddit,ethereum,Liberation from the taboo on price discussions,2024-10-29 06:07:30,"The Ethereum community still seems to ignore or taboo discussions on price.

Even after the transition to POS, the equation of 'price = security' has been established for Ethereum.

In the debate with Bitcoin maximalists, the Ethereum community, including Vitalik, argued that the burning mechanism is better for increasing value than the fixed issuance amount.

This is also why Justin Drake's 'Ultra Sound Money' meme was born.

I think we need to discuss more seriously how to gradually increase the price of Ethereum. This is not just about making money. The goal is to make Ethereum the network with the strongest security and censorship resistance.

What Bitcoin has gained strong supporters for now is the guarantee of scarcity. The belief in the immutable issuance rules. In the case of Ethereum, the policy on the total issuance amount seems too vague. I think this is Ethereum's worst selling point.

I thought about several monetary policies.

1. Increase the burn fee when the target total issuance exceeds 100 million, and reduce the burn fee when it falls below, maintaining 100 million.

2. Burn all fees including MEV to create endless deflation. When the total issuance decreases to 50 million, split the coin in half. Then, the number of Ethers will be 50 million -> 100 million -> 50 million -> 100 million repeatedly. People get excited when companies like Tesla and Nvidia do Stocksplit.

3. Set the total issuance to 100 million, and stakers only get the fees.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,ethereum,"Basic Income and Ethereum: Different Paths, Shared Vision",2024-10-26 11:41:15,"I’ve been thinking about how much /r/basicincome and /r/ethereum actually have in common. On the surface, they may seem like separate communities—one focusing on universal financial security and the other on blockchain technology—but at their core, they’re both pushing for something much bigger: a new, fairer way to organize society.

Both UBI and Ethereum are fundamentally about global cooperation through systems that are reliable, transparent, and accessible to everyone. They’re about creating a world where we don’t have to rely on centralized powers to uphold fairness; instead, we’re looking to decentralized, credibly neutral systems that we can all trust. It’s about reimagining how resources, influence, and value circulate across borders, using technology to realign incentives toward a more just and resilient society.

Money, when you think about it, is political. Every transaction, every dollar, every token is an influence, a ripple that spreads through society to sway opinions, move wallets, and ultimately shape reality. In a world where social media feels like an echo chamber, and where consent is constantly manufactured, the conversation about these ideas needs to go deeper—into the structures that uphold our shared reality.

For those interested in diving further into this vision, here’s a bit of inspiration from popular culture:

- **Arrival** – A film that shows how language, perception, and time itself can shift when we learn to see reality through a new lens.
- **Outlander** – A story of navigating history and power dynamics, reminding us that the structures of the past shape us today.
- **Mad Men** – A look at the influences and narratives crafted in the present day, showing how reality can be shaped by media and perception.
- **Devs** – A glimpse into a near-future where technology and consciousness intertwine, raising questions about determinism and the nature of reality itself.

These themes highlight that the way we organize, influence, and experience reality is constantly evolving. Basic Income and Ethereum represent two pathways that ultimately converge on the same goal: creating a more equitable and decentralized future.

Reddit,ethereum,I can't understand L2 networks no matter what,2024-10-21 12:27:28,"So my current understanding about roll-ups is that since eth gas fees are like really high per transaction, so it would be much better if the transactions are bundled and submitted as a single transaction , but like how does this work? say if we take optimism for example , like a lot of nodes are running for that particular L2 right and if I make a transaction to that network , it will be bundled with other transactions and submitted as a single transaction to the main network? is it like that? 


If say bob sends 1 eth to Alice , like how does this work on roll-ups , first the optimism nodes do the work on verifying stuffs like the balance and other and what do they do ? submit it to the main network? 


And how do they submit, like via rpc to a contract or smtn?


please help, I can't find a source that goes into technical details of this other than than blog posts saying what are L2s and how they fix the eth scaling issues.



---




Edit: It finally clicked for me , huge thanks to u/DepartedQuantity for helping me out.


So here's my understanding:

Till so far in my mind was that the rolling up is for the L1 transactions, since transaction fees are higher so send the transaction to a separate network and let them batch up multiple users transaction together with mine and submit it to the L1 as a single transaction with some proofs. And some smart contract does some magic and everything is good but it doesn't make any sense because someone either way has to pay to change the state on the main chain which is going to be really expensive. 


But the thing is that the L2 is a network own it's own with an evm and state changes and etc etc. Connected to the main chain with bridges so an equivalent on chain can be given in the other. And all the transactions happening out there is independent own its own and what it submits to the main network    are transactions details(or whatever) in L2 so if something ever happens to it , it can be recovered.


And not L1 transactions that are verified off-chain and submitted as a batch to the main chain.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

If I’d known my yield had fallen by half, I would’ve switched to another Aave pool with higher yield or to another lending platform, like Moonwell or Maple.

I’ve recently noticed a lot of people posting about this same problem on other defi subreddits, so I wanted to share how setting up email alerts when my lending APY drops by a certain threshold has helped me better optimize my USDC and save time.

I’ve made a tool called [Jarvis](https://glowing-pitch-559179.framer.app/en/) for my friends and me. I thought I would share it here as well so it can be helpful for others facing the same issue. Feel free to join the waitlist on the site, and I’ll email you within the next few days when it’s completely ready to use.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,ethereum, Ethereum builder centralization and your contribution,2024-10-18 22:13:25,"In recent weeks, more than 90% of Ethereum blocks have been built by just two block builders: beaverbuild.org and titanbuilder.xyz. This trend is growing, and it’s likely these two will dominate nearly all block production soon, profiting massively from users transactions MEV. [https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d](https://www.relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=7d)

The driving force behind this centralization is XOF (private orderflow), as explained by Toni Wahrstätter on X: [https://x.com/nero\_eth/status/1846786871998759141](https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1846786871998759141)

So, where does this private orderflow originate?

For [titanbuilder.xyz](http://titanbuilder.xyz), it partly comes from BananaGunBot (https://x.com/BananaGunBot), as seen in blocks like this one: [https://etherscan.io/block/20959121](https://etherscan.io/block/20959121)

For [beaverbuild.org](http://beaverbuild.org), it comes from platforms like [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (https://cow.fi/mev-blocker). Their FAQ states they submit to all major builders:

>MEV Blocker submits to all major block builders, including Builder0x69, f1b, Flashbots, rsync builder, Titan Builder, Gambit Labs, and Beaver Build.

But there is a catch: who created MEV Blocker? according to their FAQ:

>MEV Blocker is jointly formulated and maintained by CoW Protocol, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build. It is open to all searchers and block builders.

The last part seems questionable. With control over the order flow, who would rationally share most profitable or important transactions with competitors?

It gets worse: a bot operated by beaverbuild uses the same calldata as the notorious jaredfromsubway MEV bot (https://x.com/MevRefund/status/1835666845547815067), suggesting beaverbuild likely operates the jared bot. jaredfromsubway is known for sandwiching pretty much everything and everyone (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f2f10d1c40777ae1da742455c65828ff36df387).

So, what’s my point? Avoid trading shitcoins, especially with BananaGun. And don’t use [mevblocker.io](http://mevblocker.io) (rather make sure you have set your slippage tolerance correctly), which appears to be little more than a hypocritical frontend for beaverbuild.

Cheers from someone who got sandwiched by jared.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Reddit,bitcoin,Shout out to all the hardened HODLers,2024-11-06 12:55:21,"Around this time 2 years ago (edited!) bitcoin was trading at about $16k. Did you make it?

I'm a relative newbie; school of late 2021 and got in just before that year's ATH. I bought all the way down the slope for the next two years and even aquired some filthy shitcoins along the way.

It was pretty tough to keep finding the conviction to DCA more cash when every month bitcoin would drop again. I'd go in my garage, pump iron and [listen to some more Saylor](https://www.youtube.com/@Cryptomemeinspiration) on my headphones (and usually end up  smash-buying some more!)

I read 'The Bitcoin Standard' again, I understood it better.

I converted my shitcoins to bitcoin fairly early on and I'm so glad I took a bit of a hit on them back then.

I read Vijay Boyapati's '[The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-part-1-of-4-94087a70d9e8)' again I understood it better.

I read Yan Pritzker's 'Inventing Bitcoin', I understood it better.

I read Gigi's '[21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/)', I understood it better.

I read a load of older stuff including 'The Fourth Turning', 'The Creature from Jekyll Island', 'The Soverign Individual' and 'Atlas Shrugged'.

Yeah, I went full regard and clearly there's a lot of bias here in my choices but something in each of these books was resonating with me and solidifying my view on how money works. The more I read the more I felt I was definitely on the right road. This knowledge has become my own personal proof-of-work. The bear market, far from being bad gave me time to learn from some really great authors.

If you're a long term HODLer, dude, I take my hat off to you. It's a lonely time and not easy. But those dark days in the garage lifting weights and being down 70% punched me in the face and taught me the true meaning of what a long time preference really is.

Next challenge: HODLing through the bull market. Good luck.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

I took a very responsible approach and told myself “I’m not going to allocate more than 5-6% of my net worth for this”.

So the cash I got was around 6% of my Bitcoin networth and I finally bought and assembled a PC.

Which wallets can have multiple bitcoin addresses?

Blockchain.com can do it but is there similar out? With cheap sending fee from all that addresses?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The rCryptoCurrency Moon Week 53 Moon Burn Update.,2024-11-06 17:37:29,"Welcome to the  Moon Burn Update for Moon Week 53. In this post we'll take a look at all Moon Burns between August 20th and September 16th.

For the uninitiated Moons are a community and governance token for rCryptoCurrency. They serve many unique purposes such as:

* Earning Moons for participation on the sub. [(Yes distributions are back)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ex4s44/moon_week_52/)
* [Voting on Community governance for the sub](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth).
* [Burning Moons for a special membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cyvqam/special_memberships_are_now_live_on_rcc/).
* Approved entities can burn Moons to engage on the sub in the form of [events/amas/others.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1c7b10j/cc_ecosystem_buyers_guide_overview/)
* Off-chain earned Moons can be tipped to other Redditors on  as an appreciation for their help or contributions.

One of the best ways to keep an eye out for updates about Moons on the sub is to look for Moon Week posts which happen once every 28 days, with the next one scheduled in \~1 week.

# Let's talk Moon Burns!

Now that Moons are on both Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, Moons are burned on both chains.

Between September 16th and October 14th:

* 2,607 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum Nova](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) in three unique burn events:
* 1,716 Moons were [burned on Arbitrum One ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)in nine unique burn events:
* The total number of Moons burned between both chains over the 28 day period is: 4,323 Moons.

The Week 54 Update will be soonish and will include more information on Total Moons burned!

Yes I know we get to keep old tier benefits if we don’t make any changes. But why don’t they even care to remember while we locked up for the old levels, CRO has similar value for the new Level Up lockups they are asking for. 

They just don’t care about existing customers. They want new customers and soon they’ll backstab them too. I know many are on the same boat as me, and lost so much from the day you locked up for old card levels. Please don’t even think of locking for new levels and lose value.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Trip Report: Struggles of a new crypto user,2024-11-06 04:34:11,"Hi all, just want to give an idea of what it’s like for a new user of cryptocurrency.

Prior to this past month, I have never used crypto before. I however wanted to buy a knife on a game called CSGO in a third party market, so I decided to try out crypto to make my purchase.

I first research where to buy crypto, and find that one of the few available exchanges to me is Gemini.

I make an account, and submit my information and ID to verify. It verifies in 6 hours, which wasn’t a fun wait but whatever I guess.

I get back on my Gemini account and use my debit card to deposit. Deposit fails about 5 times, and after calling back my bank they finally let me purchase. That process took about an hour to figure out as a newbie. 

I then finally have balance in my Gemini account of $300, and make a purchase of Litecoin as my research told me this has some of the cheapest fees on its network when sending to another Litecoin wallet. 

It tries to only first give me like $280 worth using their autobuy feature, but then I realized you can go on the actual market itself within Gemini and I was able to get $300 for like $295ish. Kind of a trap if I really didnt look any deeper so bad taste in my mouth already from that

I then try to withdraw my Litecoin to the csgo market and I get a warning that my crypto is locked on the platform for ***10 DAYS*** and I cannot withdraw it. 

What the FUCK. At no point leading up to this was it ever mentioned I had to wait this long just to get my own crypto off the exchange.

Thankfully, the value of my Litecoin has gone up a bit since then but if it had fallen I would not have enough money to actually buy what I wanted.

I wait 10 full days and I finally get the chance to send it off to the csgo market and by that point the specific knife pattern I wanted was already gone. 

What a pleasant experience this was. I consider myself relatively tech savvy but this seemed quite complicated of a process with a lot of traps to avoid.

I’m unsure how the average public would even be able to use this, because my first experience honestly fucking sucked ***when I reallyyyy wanted to enjoy it***

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,We've gotta talk about Republicans and crypto,2024-11-05 00:48:05,"Tl;dr: Don't vote based on your bags. Republicans aren't the crypto boosters everyone makes them out to be, and the way Trump has used crypto as a grift to make money just reinforces existing stereotypes about crypto being scammy.

I know, I know. We're all saturated with politics and election crap right now and we're tired of it. Me too. But I hear the idea that ""Republicans are the pro-crypto party"" all the time and it's just not true.

https://preview.redd.it/e9aor4poqyyd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d39dea07e453748665ef5d8328094120fbb031

First, Republicans aren't uniformly supportive of crypto and Democrats aren't uniformly against it. My no-talent ass clown of a Senator (Roger Marshall) is a hardcore MAGA Republican but wildly anti-crypto. He called crypto a [""threat to our national security""](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-cryptocurrency-is-a-threat-to-our-national-security/) and co-sponsored a bill with Elizabeth Warren to make stricter AML/KYC regulations. During the FTX debacle he even suggested that the SEC [shut down all crypto transactions in the US](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2022/roger-marshall-kansas). Saying that Democrats aren't supportive of crypto isn't true either. When you look at the list of [congressional candidates endorsed by Stand With Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/endorsed), half of them (19/39) are Democrats. Not to mention that Democrats incorporated some crypto-supportive events into the [DNC convention](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/how-democrats-have-shifted-on-crypto/) and [Anthony Scaramucci has reportedly been working with Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/anthony-scaramucci-kamala-harris-campaigns-digital-asset-policies-.html) to develop pro-crypto policies. Saying Republicans are the more crypto-supportive party may have been true 5 years ago, but that has changed.

Secondly, we've got to talk about Trump. Saying that Trump is pro-crypto is like saying a bank robber is pro-unmarked bills. [His recent ""pro-crypto"" turn](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts) is at best a flip-flop and at worst a grift. In 2019 he said that [Bitcoin was ""based on thin air""](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en) and as recently as [December of 2021](https://decrypt.co/89108/donald-trump-calls-crypto-dangerous-even-as-melania-launches-nft), he called crypto ""dangerous"" and a ""scam."" ([And he would know!](https://apnews.com/article/17e975d3ccba4a92a9b023dff8437b21)) But recently crypto has been very kind to him. [One of his wallets](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) has almost $6 million in it.

Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist, but It ***really seems like*** after Melania Trump made an [unspecified (large) amount of money on a bunch of NFT projects in 2021 and 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/melanias-latest-nft-is-selling-for-180000-at-last-one-of-the-trumps-is-showing-entrepreneurial-spirit), Donald [suddenly changed his tune on crypto and started issuing a bunch of NFTs](https://decrypt.co/249755/trump-credits-nfts-change-of-heart-bitcoin-crypto) himself. When the NFT market dried up, he pivoted and was [collecting 2% of every transaction on shitcoins called things like ""Trump Bucks"" and ""Save America""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-donald-trump-made-nft-213019678.html) netting him at least a half million dollars. And of course don't forget about his newest ~~scam~~ DeFi project World Liberty Financial, [where 75% of all protocol revenue goes to the Trump family](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g69fob/trump_family_gets_75_of_crypto_coin_revenue_has/) (who also has no liability) and who [couldn't keep their own website running](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/trump-familys-world-liberty-finance-token-sale-appears-to-go-live-selling-220m-wlfi-in-minutes/) during the rollout even though there wasn't much interest in the project.

I'm sure it's clear how I feel about him, and if you want to vote for him, be my guest. But don't do it because you think he's ""pro-crypto"" and will pump your bags if he's elected.

https://preview.redd.it/sxtxfrmk8zyd1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=51868abee8cbcf201081e38fb3ce5761066636a1

It seems pretty clear that he has no idea what crypto is or how it works. He [can't work a crypto wallet well enough to buy a burger with it](https://youtube.com/shorts/HIv4cwkz16U?si=2zjUCdPTnYVN9l_q), tweeted that he'll make sure Bitcoin is ""[made in the USA](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1852033244729860397)"" and stumbled through a [recent interview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/donald-trump-struggles-and-seems-confused-in-painful-crypto-interview-while-trying-to-change-topic/ar-AA1qGv5X), saying:

>""It's so important. It's crypto. It's AI. It's so many other things. AI needs tremendous electricity capabilities beyond anything I ever heard.""

At the very best, he doesn't give a shit and will forget about and ignore it once it stops making him money, which effectively gives other countries the ability to set crypto regulation and reinforces the stereotype that crypto is super scammy. This point has been made over and over, but if we want the industry to grow sustainably for the long-term, [we need clear, effective regulation](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/22/tether-ceo-ardoino-says-he-expects-us-will-catch-up-in-crypto-regulation/), not benign neglect.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,A new political and financial system. Thoughts?,2024-11-06 15:42:14,"Manifesto of the Decentralized Dream

They say we’re a flawed species, stumbling through the darkness, clutching at power like it’s the last bottle on a sinking ship. Look around: empires rise and fall, currencies inflate and deflate like a cosmic joke, and the common voice gets drowned in the cacophony of ambition. Communism tried to level the field, capitalism tipped the scales, and here we are—caught in the crossfire of ideals and realities.

But what if we could flip the script? Tear down the puppeteer’s stage and hand the strings over to the crowd? Not chaos, not anarchy—a symphony where every note counts, where the melody is crafted by us all.

Enter the Decentralized Democracy—a system where power doesn’t trickle down from gilded towers but surges up from the streets, the cafés, the buzzing digital forums. Here, everyone gets a say—a real one—not just a token gesture every election cycle.

The Blueprint

Imagine a world where every vote matters, etched permanently onto a blockchain—a ledger that doesn’t bend to whims or wallets. No more shadowy backroom deals, no more laws slipping through the cracks of bloated bureaucracy. Legislation is proposed, debated, and decided by the collective. Transparent. Unchangeable.

But let’s be real. Not everyone’s an expert on climate science or economic policy, and that’s okay. In this system, votes are weighted—not by wealth or status, but by knowledge and expertise. You earn your stripes through education, experience, contribution. A scientist’s vote on environmental policy carries more weight than that of a layman, but both are heard.

The Edge

This isn’t just some utopian daydream. It’s a calculated risk—a gamble on ourselves. The benefits are as clear as they are profound:
	•	True Representation: No more proxies or middlemen. Your voice is your own, echoing in the halls of digital governance.
	•	Informed Decisions: Policies shaped by those who know them best, steering the ship with a steady hand.
	•	Transparency and Trust: With blockchain, every transaction, every vote, is a matter of public record. No smoke. No mirrors.

The Shadows

But every light casts a shadow:
	•	The Populist Trap: Give the crowd too much sway, and you risk the tyranny of the majority. Waves of emotion can capsize the ship of reason.
	•	Access and Inequality: Not everyone has equal access to technology or education. We risk widening the gap we seek to close.
	•	The Data Dilemma: A system so reliant on digital infrastructure is a ripe target for those who’d love to see it fail.

The Safeguards

We’re not naive. We’ve built in checks, balances—circuit breakers for when the system overheats:
	•	Expert Panels: Before a vote hits the public, it passes through a gauntlet of scrutiny by verified experts, filtering out the noise.
	•	Constitutional Backbone: An immutable set of rights and principles that no majority can overturn—the bedrock of our society.
	•	Education Initiatives: Uplift the many by providing access to learning, narrowing the chasm of inequality.

The Road Ahead

This won’t be easy. The old guard won’t relinquish power without a fight. There will be hurdles, missteps, maybe even failures. But progress isn’t a straight line; it’s a rugged climb.

This manifesto isn’t just a proclamation—it’s an invitation. To those tired of the same old song and dance, who feel the weight of decisions made in rooms they’ll never see. It’s time to take a stand, to mold the future with our own hands.

We are flawed, yes. But within those imperfections lies the spark of innovation, the drive to be better than we were yesterday.

Let’s rewrite the story, one block at a time.

Breaking the Chains: A New Democracy Forged on the Blockchain

Abstract

We’re standing at the crossroads of history, where the old systems are crumbling under the weight of their own contradictions. This isn’t just another white paper—it’s a manifesto for a new era. We’re proposing a radical shift: a political and monetary system that doesn’t just tip its hat to democracy but lives and breathes it. By leveraging blockchain technology, we’re putting power back where it belongs—in the hands of the people. No more middlemen, no more illusions. Just a transparent, secure, and inclusive system where every voice matters, and expertise guides the way.

1. Introduction

For too long, we’ve been caught in the tug-of-war between capitalism and communism, each promising utopia but delivering something far less. These systems, riddled with centralized power and human flaws, have left us disillusioned. Let’s face it—we’re imperfect beings prone to bias and error. But what if we could design a system that rises above our imperfections? A system that maximizes participation and fairness while minimizing the pitfalls of human nature. It’s time to reimagine democracy, to make it more than a lofty ideal.

2. The New Blueprint

2.1. Direct Democracy via Blockchain

Say goodbye to the days of handing over your voice to someone else. In this new order, you are the policymaker.
	•	Blockchain Backbone: Every vote you cast is etched into an unchangeable ledger. No tampering, no manipulation—just pure, unadulterated democracy.
	•	Algorithmic Governance: Smart contracts take the reins, executing decisions without human error or bias. The law becomes code, and the code is law.

2.2. Weighted Voting Based on Expertise

Let’s be honest—not all opinions are created equal when it comes to complex issues. That’s why your vote carries more weight where your expertise shines.
	•	Earn Your Influence: Credentials, experience, proven knowledge—these aren’t just trophies; they’re your ticket to greater influence on issues that matter.
	•	Dynamic Influence: As you grow, so does your impact. Your voting weight adjusts with your evolving expertise.

3. Making It Happen

3.1. Establishing Expertise
	•	Verification on the Chain: Your qualifications are validated and recorded on the blockchain. No more fakes slipping through the cracks.
	•	Lifelong Learning: Knowledge is power, literally. Educational platforms let you expand your influence by expanding your mind.

3.2. The Voting Mechanism
	•	Rock-Solid Security: Biometric data and cryptographic keys ensure your vote is yours and yours alone.
	•	Transparent Yet Private: Votes are open for auditing, but your identity stays under wraps. Participate without sacrificing privacy.
	•	Accessible to All: User-friendly interfaces mean you don’t need a tech degree to have your say.

4. The Hurdles We Face

4.1. Populism and Mob Rule
	•	The Risk: Without checks, direct democracy can spiral into chaos, driven by fleeting emotions and misinformation.

4.2. Disinformation and Manipulation
	•	The Risk: False information can poison the well, skewing public opinion and derailing sound decision-making.

4.3. Technological Barriers
	•	The Risk: If not everyone can access the tech, we risk creating a new class of voiceless citizens.

5. Building the Safeguards

5.1. Councils of Expertise
	•	The Gatekeepers: Panels of experts review proposed legislation to ensure it’s feasible and rights-compliant before it hits the public floor.
	•	Rotating Membership: No entrenched power here. Experts are rotated regularly to keep the system fresh and unbiased.

5.2. An Unshakable Ethical Core
	•	Foundational Principles: A constitution that enshrines fundamental rights and ethics, untouchable by fleeting majorities.
	•	Judicial Oversight: An independent judiciary, maybe even with algorithmic assistance, keeps new laws in check with our core values.

5.3. Battling Misinformation
	•	Truth Hubs: Integrated platforms deliver verified facts and deep analyses on the issues at hand.
	•	Educate to Empower: Media literacy programs arm citizens with the skills to sift truth from lies.

5.4. Tech for the People
	•	Bridging the Divide: Massive investment in tech infrastructure ensures everyone can plug into the system.
	•	Guiding Hands: Support services help citizens navigate this new landscape with confidence.

5.5. Emergency Measures
	•	Swift Action Protocols: When immediate intervention is needed, predefined processes allow for temporary measures, always accountable to the people.

6. Rewriting the Economic Playbook

6.1. A Decentralized Economy
	•	Digital Currency: A blockchain-based currency makes transactions transparent and cuts corruption off at the knees.
	•	Economic Voices: You get a say in how taxes are levied and spent. The economy serves the public interest, not the other way around.

7. Why This Matters
	•	True Empowerment: This isn’t just about having a voice—it’s about that voice making a real difference.
	•	Smart Governance: Decisions influenced by those who know best, leading to policies that actually work.
	•	Built on Trust: Transparency isn’t a feature; it’s the foundation. Trust isn’t demanded; it’s earned.
	•	Future-Proof: This system isn’t set in stone. It evolves, adapts, and grows along with society.

8. Conclusion

We’re not just proposing a new system—we’re igniting a revolution of participation, transparency, and fairness. It’s a bold move, no doubt. There will be challenges, naysayers, and obstacles we can’t yet foresee. But the status quo isn’t just broken; it’s shattered. It’s time to build something better, something that truly reflects the will and wisdom of the people.

Next Steps
	•	Pilot the Vision: Launch small-scale trials to work out the kinks and prove the concept.
	•	Engage the Masses: Open dialogues across diverse communities to refine and strengthen the system.
	•	Invest in the Future: Pour resources into the tech and infrastructure that will make this vision a reality.

Unveiling the Illusion: A Stark Comparison of Governance

You see, the world’s a stage filled with puppets masquerading as leaders, pulling strings that aren’t theirs to pull. Let’s cut through the facade and lay it bare. We’ll compare this new, unshackled system to the so-called powerhouses of governance: the USA, Russia, Austria, the UK, and Norway. Time to hold a mirror to their flaws and virtues.

1. United States of America (USA)

Government Type: A federal constitutional republic that parades as a representative democracy.

Pros of Our Proposed System Over the USA:
	•	Direct Control: No more waiting for election cycles that offer choices between the lesser of two evils. You vote on the laws that shape your life.
	•	Brains Over Bluster: Weighted votes ensure decisions aren’t left to the whims of the uninformed. Expertise drives policy, not popularity contests.
	•	Transparency Unleashed: Blockchain doesn’t play favorites. Every transaction, every vote—out in the open for all to see.

Cons Compared to the USA:
	•	Breaking the Mold: Dismantling a centuries-old system isn’t for the faint of heart. The transition would be a labyrinth of legal and societal hurdles.
	•	The Left Behind: Weighted voting could sideline those without fancy degrees or titles. Equality takes a hit when expertise is the gatekeeper.
	•	Digital Divide: Not everyone’s plugged into the matrix. Tech gaps could leave voices unheard, widening the chasm we aim to close.

2. Russia

Government Type: A federal semi-presidential republic with power clenched tightly at the center.

Pros Over Russia:
	•	Power to the People: Dismantles the top-down control, handing the reins to the citizens who’ve been kept at arm’s length.
	•	Corruption Exposed: Blockchain drags corruption into the light, kicking and screaming. No more shadows to hide in.
	•	Decentralized Authority: Authority isn’t a baton passed among elites but a collective symphony of voices.

Cons Compared to Russia:
	•	The Iron Grip: Those in power won’t go quietly. Expect resistance that’s more than just political—it could get messy.
	•	Shock to the System: You can’t turn a ship that size on a dime without causing some waves. Cultural whiplash is a real risk.
	•	Digital Warfare: Cybersecurity isn’t a game here. The system must be bulletproof against attacks from foes, foreign and domestic.

3. Austria

Government Type: A federal parliamentary republic that enjoys its afternoon coffee with a side of stability.

Pros Over Austria:
	•	Elevated Engagement: Invites citizens from their cafés into the chambers of power. Civic duty becomes more than a checkbox.
	•	Expert-Driven Policies: Let’s face it—complex issues need more than common sense. Specialists steer the ship through tricky waters.

Cons Compared to Austria:
	•	Why Fix What’s Not Broken?: Austria’s got a good thing going. Rocking the boat might tip it over.
	•	Elitism in Disguise: Weighted votes could be seen as a new aristocracy—knowledge as the new nobility, leaving others in the dust.
	•	Price Tag of Change: Revolution doesn’t come cheap. The financial and social costs could outweigh the gains.

4. United Kingdom (UK)

Government Type: A unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy draped in tradition and tea.

Pros Over the UK:
	•	Cutting the Strings: Replaces lords and ladies with the voices of the people. No more birthright politics.
	•	Law by the Masses: Puts legislation into the hands of those it affects most—the citizens.
	•	Digital Renaissance: Drags a centuries-old system into the 21st century, kicking and screaming.

Cons Compared to the UK:
	•	Tradition Runs Deep: The monarchy isn’t just a system; it’s a symbol. Uprooting it could tear at the national fabric.
	•	Legal Quagmire: An uncodified constitution means changing the rules is like nailing jelly to a wall.
	•	Winds of Populism: Even with safeguards, the tides of public opinion can be as fickle as British weather.

5. Norway

Government Type: A unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a social welfare system that’s the envy of many.

Pros Over Norway:
	•	Amplifying Voices: Builds on Norway’s strong civic foundations, taking participation to the next level.
	•	Transparency Maxed Out: If you thought their system was open, wait until every decision is on the blockchain.

Cons Compared to Norway:
	•	Gold Standard Governance: When you’re at the top, drastic change is a risk, not a reward.
	•	Don’t Rock the Boat: Introducing radical shifts could disturb the delicate balance they’ve perfected.
	•	Resource Reallocation: Diverting funds to overhaul the system might drain resources from programs that already work like a charm.

The Big Picture Pros:
	•	Seizing the Reins: Empowers individuals to not just dream of change but to enact it.
	•	Smart Policy Making: Harnesses the sharpest minds where they matter most.
	•	Cleaning House: Shines a light so bright, corruption scatters like roaches.

The Caveats:
	•	Equality vs. Equity: Weighted voting walks a fine line between fair and unfair.
	•	Tech Dependency: A system is only as strong as its weakest link, and technology can be a fickle friend.
	•	The Cogs Slow Down: Direct democracy can be a sluggish beast; too many cooks can spoil the broth.

Conclusion

Our proposed system isn’t just a new page—it’s a whole new book. For places where power hoards and corruption festers, it’s a beacon slicing through the fog. In lands where democracy hums along, it’s a bold step into the future, with risks that may or may not be worth the leap.

Change on this scale isn’t a tweak; it’s a metamorphosis. It demands courage, debate, and a willingness to step into uncharted territory. So ask yourself: Are you content with the illusion of control, or do you dare to seize the wheel?

It’s time to choose—maintain the status quo or disrupt the narrative. The stage is set, the spotlight is on, and the next move is yours.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Can somebody explain leverage to me?,2024-11-06 10:09:55,"So, I'm just going to ignore all the condescending comments saying not to do it, it's not for you etc. But go ahead and make them.

I've been playing around with the demo feature on Bitget where you can play at futures with $3000. I've made a few extra hundred so far. 

I'm just trying to understand all the features, the things like mark price liquidation price etc, but also just how it works in general. 

Just looking for someone who actually understands this stuff to explain a few things to me, namely where and what the risks are.

I watched a tutorial video that said it's safer to use isolated rather than cross at the start. So I'm doing that. 

I guess it's been easier lately because things are generally going up, but even so, I kind of can't work out how it can go so badly wrong for people. I don't mean that in an arrogant ""I'm so smart"" kind of way, I mean I just don't understand the maths.

So let's say I open a long on BTC with $1000 at 20x. I put a stop loss at maybe -5%, so I stand to lose $50 max (I'm not sure if that the case if I'm using leverage, but let me know. Also there was a post on here recently from someone who said that they opened it with only 1x and then increased it later, which makes even less sense tbh). Then when the price increases a bit, say by 7% , I move my stop loss maybe 5% above my entry price, so there's then no risk. Then after that whatever gains made are increased by 20x?

I mean, I just don't see how that can be true, so I think I'm not understanding something. It's like you buy something for $1000 and it goes up by $100 and you say to the exchange, nah but I want 20x the profit, and they say ok. I don't understand where the corresponding risk is. I guess it's something to do with liquidation price, but if the stop loss is set above that point, then how can you ever lose (unless obviously you pick every single trade badly and keep triggering small stop losses).

Or is it that, if I put $1000 on at 20x leverage then I'm only actually trading with $50, but I still stand to lose $1000.

Honestly, I know I probably sound stupid, but i just don't get it.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,A muted response from crypto may suggest long-term market manipulation more than any point in history. ,2024-11-06 11:02:22,"The crypto bull market of 2017 and 2021 did appear more grass rooted compared to today. Commentary and speculation from everyday people on crypto was rife. Engagement on sub-reddits such as r/cc was through the roof. The markets back then definitely seem to be more reactionary to news. 

The vibe of this bullrun of 2024 feels distinctly different. Less noise, less visible engagement. Many could point at a shift to more institutional investment particularly in the advent of ETFs however the tapering of wider crypto engagement does seem a little odd. 

Love him or hate him, towards the end Trumps pro-crypto narrative has been the strongest yet out of any US presidential candidate in political history. When you couple that with the fact that the US is the world's largest economy and financial epicentre, many could argue that the crypto market should be going parabolic on his shock victory. However as I write market movements are fairly muted in crypto volatility terms with BTC +6% and ETH +8%. In past cycles this news against the odds would have sent markets skywards 🚀 

It could be that this observation is premature and that's still to come. It could be that people don't believe that trump will really follow through on his pro-crypto narrative. It could be that people just don't care. However in the past reactionary news has tend to be one of the biggest drivers of price. Having a pro-crypto us president is arguably one of the biggest results for crypto in its history. As someone that's become increasingly cynical of the involvement of stablecoins within the crypto industry, if the upside move doesn't transpire I'd lean more towards the possibility that is more evidence of long-term market manipulation in this cycle than previous cycles.

**TL;DR**

In the grassroots hype cycles of the 2017 & 2021 bullruns news of pro-US president would have sent the markets to the moon. If this doesn't transpire it could be further evidence of long-term market manipulation, possibly via stablecoins. The questionable backing of many dollar pegged stablecoims could very well be FTX on steroids for genuine decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency projects and think it's important to differentiate/ disassociate from them until they are.

More or less every month, I have asked for an update and been told that the technical team is working on it and to be patient.

Today I asked for a further update. Initially, I was given the usual story, be patient, the technical team is working on it. Then after a couple of exchanges where I said five months was more than long enough to fix the issue, I was told that it had been fixed and to check my account! Needless to say the Flare was not in my account.

I was then given a new reference number since they accepted that the problem hadn’t been fixed.

But it is clear to me that nothing had been done in 5 months and I don’t expect anything to be done going forward.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Be wary of retrospective/backwards-looking analyses because they're easily very manipulated when there are too few data points/cycles,2024-11-04 18:47:58,"**TL;DR**:

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Correlation does not imply causation

Most crypto predictions are retroactive studies that are cherry-picked to look good with past data but have no accuracy in predicting the future. They're complete guesswork and have a high chance of eventually failing in future cycles.

-------------------------

**Retrospective study**: A backwards-looking study that considers past data

**Prospective study**: A forwards-looking study that establishes a hypothesis first and then checks whether future data supports the hypothesis.

####**The problem with retrospective studies**

In general, prospective studies are always considered to be more trustworthy than retrospective studies of similar sample sizes. They are heavily affected by selection bias. There are exceptions for large-scale retroactive studies that have 10000+ data points that span decades.

In addition, many retrospective studies (especially in crypto) are completely manipulated because are **not properly set up with a hypothesis ahead of time**. Instead, they look for interesting patterns in past data until they find one. And then they establish a hypothesis AFTERWARDS to match that data. This is a huge taboo in statistics, and yet it happens all the time in crypto investing.

Using retrospective data to explain correlation without having a strong hypothesis created at the start of the study ends up looking like this XKCD comic:

https://xkcd.com/882/

Only the results that have an interesting narrative are published while the uninteresting ones are quietly discarded.

####**Too few crypto cycles for data points**

**Correlation does not imply causation, and past performance is no guarantee of future results.**

We really only have 3 past price cycles (since the 1st epoch didn't have stable markets):

* Epoch 2: 2012-2016
* Epoch 3: 2016-2020
* Epoch 4: 2020-2024
* Epoch 5: 2024-

A line can fit any 2 data points perfectly while a curve can fit any 3 data points perfectly.

That means any logarithmic, exponential, or 2nd-degree polynomial can perfectly-fit 3 crypto cycles. It's so easy to fit any chart type because there are so few crypto cycles for data points.

####**Prior notable predictions that failed**

* Rainbow Chart was plotted to perfect-fit previous cycles, and then it immediately failed before it lasted a full cycle and had to be revised.
* CBBI to perfect-fit previous cycles, and then it failed to last a single cycle because it didn't predict a double-peak
* It was said that no one who held BTC for over 4 years would have a loss. And then it was moved to 5 years, and then 6 years when each of those narratives failed in subsequent cycles.
* Bitcoin bull run starts 6 months BEFORE the halving is a false narrative that never happened
* Bitcoin bull run starts 6 months AFTER the halving is a false narrative that that only happened in Epoch 2
* Cycle dates are unpredictable:
  * BTC price hits a new ATH 5 days (Epoch 2), 145 days (Epoch 3), 85 days (Epoch 4) after the halving
  * BTC price hits a cycle peak 365 days (Epoch 2), 525 days (Epoch 3), 341/524 days (Epoch 4) after the halving
  * BTC large bull run starts -270 days and 225 days (Epoch 2, there are 2 pumps), -400 days (Epoch 3), 150 days (Epoch 4) after the halving

Just like before, many narratives will fail, and some will succeed. It's mostly just pure luck and guesses.

If you really want to establish a strong study, create **a prospective study with a strong hypothesis**, and then test it over 5+ epochs. Retroactive studies with few data points are just not trustworthy.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,How to apply Pohlig Hellman using a very limited set of auxiliary inputs in that case ?,2024-11-04 15:25:21,"So I was reading about [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1321). The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034
Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,crypto,Going from KEM to Signatures,2024-10-13 12:46:29,"Is there a known efficient way to generically convert a secure KEM into a signature scheme? I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme.  
I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

And kinda related question, would me saying that ""in the race between encryptors and cryptanalysts/hackers, the cryptanalysts/hackers are winning"", be objectively false?",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034
Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,crypto,Falcon vs. Dilithium vs. SPHINCS+,2024-08-30 17:39:49,"What do you believe is the best choice.

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

This is more of a Falcon vs. Dilithium post as they seem to be the more commonly used.

Why should I prefer Dilithium over Falcon? Any opinions?",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034
Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-11-07 00:51:21.668034

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times
