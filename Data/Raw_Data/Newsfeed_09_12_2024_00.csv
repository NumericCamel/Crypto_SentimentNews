However, this substantial concentration of Bitcoin within a single entity has raised important questions about the potential risks associated with such centralization.  The Fallout Of A Potential Coinbase Disaster Per the report, critics argue that a significant concentration of assets can lead to systemic risks, particularly if the exchange were to face security issues, legal pressures, or other crises.  Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In A ‘Healthier’ Place Now, Here’s Why Jameson Lopp, CTO of multi-sig custodian Casa, points out that while Coinbase is considered more stable than many exchanges, it remains vulnerable to pressures from nation-states and could face scenarios akin to the US government’s historical seizure of gold during the 1930s. The implications of a Coinbase disaster—such as a hack resulting in the loss of customer funds—could reverberate throughout the cryptocurrency market. Such an event would not only undermine public confidence in crypto but could also lead to a significant downturn in market prices, potentially triggering a prolonged bear market.  The report notes that the fear is compounded by the fact that more than 73 million Americans hold accounts on the platform, meaning the fallout could affect a vast number of retail investors. Could A Bitcoin Fork Be On The Horizon?  While some experts, like Steven Lubka from Swan Private, believe a catastrophic loss is unlikely due to Coinbase’s “advanced security measures,” the risk of custodial centralization remains a concern.  The idea of a Bitcoin fork to recover lost assets—similar to the Ethereum situation following the DAO hack in 2016—has been suggested. However, experts believe that while influential stakeholders might push for a rollback to “recover” their funds, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s network would likely reject such proposals. Lisa Neigut, founder of Base58, explains that Bitcoin’s unique Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model creates a buffer against centralized risks. In this model, if a bug affects a particular entity’s keys, it only impacts that entity, preserving the overall integrity of the network.  This separation of concerns is crucial for maintaining the health of the Bitcoin protocol, especially in the face of potential centralization threats. Yet, concerns persist about how large custodians like Coinbase could influence the broader ecosystem.  Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest Armin Sabouri, CTO of Botanix Labs, warns that significant holders could coerce the community by threatening to dump their assets, potentially crashing the market price and forcing the network to ossify in response to their demands. This scenario poses a direct challenge to Bitcoin’s foundational ethos of decentralization. In sum, the sense of risk regarding the increased amount of holdings that the exchange poses remains a topic for debate in the future of the market. In addition, with the increased amount of methods to potentially hack or attempt to hack exchanges like Coinbase, it would be imperative to monitor and prevent these types of scenarios to avoid another Mt. Gox catastrophe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $57,650, having failed to break above the $58,000 resistance level for two days in a row.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Uniswap Overcome Recent Challenges As Surges and Investors Flock To Mpeppe,2024-09-11 23:17:58+00:00,"Uniswap (UNI), one of the most prominent decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the crypto space, is currently making headlines for its potential 139% price breakout. As regulatory discussions unfold in the U.S. Congress, investors are eyeing both Uniswap and the up-and-coming Mpeppe (MPEPE) token for substantial gains. With Uniswap facing heightened scrutiny but showing signs of a bullish reversal, many are diversifying into Mpeppe, which has been forecasted to surge alongside the broader market. Uniswap and the Impact of DeFi Regulations Uniswap (UNI) finds itself at the center of a critical moment in DeFi history as the U.S. Congress kicks off its first-ever hearing on decentralized finance. Titled “Decoding DeFi: Breaking Down the Future for Decentralized Finance,” the hearing aims to explore regulatory approaches to DeFi in the United States. Uniswap, being one of the leading platforms in the DeFi ecosystem, stands to benefit significantly from these discussions, especially if favorable policies are introduced. With Uniswap (UNI)’s price currently hovering around $6.55, analysts are watching for a bullish breakout. The platform has already garnered significant interest from U.S.-based users, according to Statista data, making it a potential winner from any positive policy outcomes. Uniswap Price Set for 139% Surge? Despite regulatory uncertainty, Uniswap (UNI)’s technical chart reveals a bullish reversal pattern. The price is forming a falling wedge, a structure often associated with upward momentum. With the apex of the wedge nearing, traders are preparing for a significant breakout, which could propel Uniswap (UNI)’s price to $16, marking a 139% increase from current levels. This optimistic scenario hinges on the price breaking through key resistance levels around $9 and moving towards $16. A bullish breakout is becoming increasingly likely as market participants anticipate the results of the congressional hearings, which could shape the future of DeFi in the United States. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gathers Momentum While Uniswap (UNI) has been in the spotlight due to regulatory scrutiny, another token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is quietly building momentum. With its unique gambling and gaming ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted attention from both retail and institutional investors. As Uniswap (UNI) whales and other big players look to diversify their portfolios, many are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its high-growth potential. Market experts have predicted that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see a 150% surge in the coming weeks, making it a hot target for traders seeking rapid returns. This token, which offers a mix of utility in decentralized gambling and community-driven incentives, is quickly gaining traction and becoming a serious contender in the crypto market. How Uniswap and Mpeppe Could Complement Each Other The simultaneous rise of Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) shows how the DeFi ecosystem is maturing. While Uniswap (UNI) provides the infrastructure for decentralized trading, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an innovative platform that blends DeFi with gaming and gambling, a combination that is proving to be highly attractive to users. As Uniswap (UNI) continues to attract large trading volumes, particularly from U.S. users, many traders are using their profits from Uniswap (UNI) to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE), anticipating significant gains. With Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s expected price surge and Uniswap (UNI)’s potential breakout, both tokens represent a new wave of opportunity for crypto investors. Uniswap’s Price at a Critical Junction The next few days will be crucial for Uniswap (UNI). If the price successfully breaks out of the falling wedge pattern, we could see a rally towards $16, cementing Uniswap (UNI)’s position as a leading DEX. On the other hand, if the breakout fails, the price could drop as low as $4, or even $2, invalidating the current bullish sentiment. Investors are keenly watching the outcome of the congressional hearings and regulatory discussions, as these will likely dictate Uniswap (UNI)’s short-term trajectory. If DeFi regulations turn out to be favorable, we could witness a significant boost not only for Uniswap (UNI) but for the entire DeFi sector. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Uniswap and Mpeppe While Uniswap (UNI) is poised for a major breakout, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as the next big thing in the crypto market. With Uniswap (UNI) gaining from potential regulatory clarity and Mpeppe (MPEPE) capturing the attention of investors with its 150% growth forecast, both tokens are set to thrive. As the crypto space continues to evolve, Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer two distinct yet complementary investment opportunities. Uniswap (UNI) provides a robust platform for decentralized trading, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the gambling and gaming sectors. Together, they are paving the way for the next generation of DeFi innovations, offering investors substantial gains in the process.

Even though POL prices are still struggling, on-chain data points to a robust ecosystem that could support prices in the medium to long term. Over $214 Billion In DEX Volume Processed Via Polygon Aggregating data from DeFiLlama, an analytic platform, and the Aggegration Layer, a core hub for Polygon, the sidechain said it has deep liquidity and maintains a strong alignment with Ethereum. This alignment instills confidence in the platform’s interoperability, positioning Polygon as a preferred choice for developers launching dapps in a low-fee, scalable environment. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes 7% Dogecoin Jump—Will It Smash The $0.15 Barrier? Since the start of the year, Polygon has been growing rapidly. To put in the numbers, the platform has processed over $214 billion in decentralized exchange volume. At the same time, it has enabled the addition of $102 billion worth of assets through centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and others. These impressive figures show that the platform is popular despite the availability of layer-2 alternatives, and it can also easily handle large-scale transactions securely. Besides the huge transaction count processed by Polygon, going by trends, it is highly likely that the Aggregation Layer, better known as the AggLayer, will boost liquidity and general utility.   The AggLayer will be central to Polygon’s mission to scale Ethereum further while connecting all layer-2s technology built using its technology. In this design, the goal will be to ensure that POL has more utility while all layer-2s connecting access instant liquidity. Polygon Tech Finding Adoption: Why Is POL Down? With the upgrade from MATIC to POL on September 4, the new token means holders play a heavier role. For example, besides POL being used to reward validators who stake, it will be used to secure other platforms linked via the AggLayer. These added functionalities will help prop up bulls as the sidechain progresses in its goal of scaling. Related Reading: Bullish Signals Emerge For Ethereum: Price Rises Above Downward Trendline And Key MA Levels That Polygon is eager to scale without comprising security could explain the rising adoption levels. Recently, the Italian government issued a €25 million digital bond on Polygon PoS. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton, Ondo, and Spiko all leverage Polygon technology as they tokenize United States Treasuries, according to RWA.xyz data. Even as impressive as Polygon has been growing, POL is still struggling. After the highly anticipated migration, the token edged lower, finding support at $0.35.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Why Bitcoin Retesting $57,000 Is Good For The Price",2024-09-11 22:00:20+00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) is finally making a comeback, with recent price spikes signaling a potential start of the long-awaited market bull run. As the cryptocurrency retests the $57,000 level, this renewed momentum could ignite a positive price rally, potentially driving more gains for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Retests New Levels At $57,000 On Tuesday, September 10, Santiment, a market intelligence platform, disclosed a new positive change in Bitcoin’s price movements. The platform revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin’s market value has experienced a notable uptick, skyrocketing to $57,600 this week.  Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Rise 3,600% To $3.7, Here’s When Notably, Bitcoin’s price surged more than 4.8% on Monday, September 8, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency, which has been recording persistent price declines over the past few months. Earlier in August, the price of Bitcoin crashed below the $50,000 level, reflecting a decline of more than 20%.  This massive price decline was triggered by various factors including large scale liquidations from the German government and the increased sell off fears and market uncertainty fueled by Mt.Gox’s Bitcoin distribution plan. As the market digested the price crash, Bitcoin fought its way back from previous lows to hit its current price above $56,000.  Currently, the cryptocurrency is retesting new support levels around $57,000. A push above this price mark could potentially signal the onset of an even larger rally. Santiment has disclosed that Bitcoin’s recent price increase has come amidst short-selling activities ongoing on major crypto exchanges such as Binance and Bitmex since September 7.  Based on the current market sentiment, the market intelligence platform suggests that the prevailing Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) amongst investors in the crypto market could contribute to an even higher price surge for Bitcoin.  This bullish sentiment is also shared by Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto analyst, who has reported that Bitcoin is presently holding a price range between $58,000 and $56,000. Poppe indicated that the cryptocurrency is showing strong price fundamentals, while many altcoins are gaining momentum.  The analyst expressed surprise that Bitcoin was able to invalidate his previous bearish set up to break above $56,000. As such, Poppe expects more positive inflows into the market if Bitcoin can have a retest above $55,000. He believes that if the cryptocurrency can break through this level, its price could surge to new levels between $60,000 to $61,000 in the coming weeks.   Historical Patterns Suggests Imminent BTC Break Out A crypto analyst, identified as ‘Rekt Capital’ on X has made a bullish projection for Bitcoin, anticipating a major price breakout for the cryptocurrency soon. Historical patterns currently suggest that Bitcoin could potentially experience a significant price rally and push out of bearish trends in the next two weeks.  Related Reading: Ethereum In 3 Months: Legendary Analyst Reveals Prediction For December Rekt Capital has disclosed that the month of September is typically a bearish period with limited monthly returns for Bitcoin. However, chances are that by October, Bitcoin’s price could surge considerably, extending this positive momentum into November and December.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest,2024-09-11 20:30:39+00:00,"Chainlink is in a consolidation phase after weeks of volatility and selling pressure. The price currently holds above a support level of $10, a crucial liquidity level. The altcoin attracts the attention of analysts and investors who anticipate higher prices soon.  Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges Past $130 Resistance As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Data from Santiment reveals rising open interest, which signals sustained demand for Chainlink. As more traders and investors build positions, this increase in open interest suggests that a price rally could be on the horizon. This stabilization around the $10 mark has given some confidence to those who believe LINK may be poised for a breakout. Many analysts see this as a potential turning point for Chainlink, with its current price action reflecting growing optimism for future gains. If the consolidation holds and momentum builds, LINK could potentially push past its recent resistance and aim for higher levels. Chainlink Investors Showing Confidence  Chainlink is testing key supply at its current levels, and top traders and investors are confident in a potential rise for LINK in the coming weeks. One significant indicator signaling strength is the rising Open Interest (OI), as revealed by Santiment. OI tracks the number of active contracts tied to a cryptocurrency, serving as a reflection of market engagement. When OI increases, it signals growing liquidity and interest in the market, while a decrease in OI typically points to reduced exposure. From a price analysis perspective, a rise in OI combined with a price dip often confirms a continuing downtrend. On the other hand, if OI decreases while the price rises, it may signal a bearish reversal. In Chainlink’s case, both OI and price are increasing, which suggests that the current uptrend could persist. As investors monitor the market, many are waiting for price confirmation above current levels to keep the momentum going and shift the overall negative sentiment that has clouded Chainlink in recent weeks. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rally Brewing? On-Chain Metrics Suggest Investors Optimism LINK’s breakout could fuel a bullish run, as traders expect a more bullish trajectory in the short term. The rising OI serves as a strong indicator that market participants are increasingly confident in LINK’s potential for further gains. LINK Price Testing Supply At $10.8 Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $10.40 after testing local resistance at $10.83, positioning for a potential breakout toward higher prices. The price is struggling to clear the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $10.71, a key indicator that has acted as a resistance since late August. For bulls to maintain momentum, LINK must reclaim the 4H 200 MA and target the next resistance at $12.70. Breaking past this level would signal a reversal and could lead to a more sustained uptrend, offering investors hope for further gains. However, if LINK fails to break through the 4H 200 MA, the altcoin will likely face a pullback, with support anticipated at lower demand levels around $9.30. A failure to hold this support could result in even lower prices, reinforcing the downside risk for traders.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Analysts Predict XRP ‘Mega Pump’ And ‘Perpetual Cycle’ – Details,2024-09-11 19:00:01+00:00,"Crypto analysts have XRP under the lens, as the altcoin has been consolidating for over 500 days. Well-known XRP figure Edward Farina recently predicted that the coin will be on a “perpetual cycle.” Farina had this to say during the Istanbul Blockchain Week, with many believing XRP will enter into its biggest bull cycle despite the currently unstable market conditions. He has called on investors to enjoy the current situation while prices are low. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Addresses See 5% Holding Boost – What’s Driving The Accumulation? Another crypto analyst, Egrag, shares his technical examination of XRP’s price movement in support of Farina’s optimism: The token’s recent resurgence within a key support and resistance levels, particularly $0.3931, signifies a very robust support zone. This particular movement of XRP has consolidated for over one and half years, which he thinks could be considered the accumulation that must be formed prior to a massive breakout. Egrag’s chart reveals that the bullish targets could be located at $0.739, $0.924, and may even be as high as $1.469. #XRP 540 Days Ranging Since March 13th, 2024! 🔥 If you’re getting shaken by these tiny moves, you don’t deserve the MASSIVE MEGA PUMPS that are coming!#XRPArmy STAY STEADY pic.twitter.com/ErNrvkO4F3 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 7, 2024 ‘Mega Pump’ On The Horizon? From Egrag’s analysis, holders of XRP are about to get what he terms a “Mega Pump.” While he maintains that those who held onto their tokens during this quiet phase may be rewarded in big proportions, he put forth a contrary belief that individuals who sold their XRP don’t deserve the massive mega pumps ahead. While XRP remains in this range, other cryptocurrencies climb. Bitcoin peaked in June 2024; Binance Coin peaked this year in April 2024. Even meme currencies like Shiba Inu and FLOKI soared, although given the volatility of the crypto market these were not sustained for long. Despite the laggard performance, however, some long-term investors of XRP are pretty confident that the long accumulation phase will be followed by a breakout. ‘Perpetual Cycle’ Incoming? Farina’s strategy is dollar-cost averaging: a practice wherein investors gradually buy an asset, particularly when it’s down from the peak. He said it was an excellent candidate for long-term accumulation since XRP remains 80% below its $3.84 record price back in 2018. $XRP won’t experience a bull run, it will be a perpetual cycle. In a few years, we’ll look back at today’s prices, it will feel absolutely unbelievable. EAK TV interview at @IstanbulBlockWk #IBW2024 pic.twitter.com/wS30CFTAHI — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) September 8, 2024 Further, he noted that this may put investors in a position to reap extraordinary gains once the market eventually reverses upward. Farina is not in a vacuum with his optimism. Other analysts have mirrored his view, saying XRP could go up as much as $50, or even up to $100, in the not-so-distant future. Related Reading: BNB Weekly Active Addresses Surge Over 6% – Is A Rally On The Way? Will XRP Break Out? XRP is still affordable, trading around $0.527 at the time of writing.

Whether or not the “mega pump” occurs, the extended consolidation phase for XRP could be a preparatory move for something big.

September 2024: ICP Struggles Amidst Market Uncertainty The Internet Computer (ICP) has had a challenging year. Despite its innovative goals and potential to decentralize the web, ICP has seen a bearish trend throughout 2024. The current price of ICP is hovering around $7.28, a significant drop from its all-time high of $750.73 back in May 2021. Market analysis suggests that ICP is facing resistance at the $7.41 level and struggling to break out of its downward trajectory. However, not all is bleak Internet Computer (ICP). As developers continue to build on the platform and decentralized applications (dApps) grow in number, there is potential for a bullish turnaround. Analysts predict that if Internet Computer (ICP) can regain momentum and break through its resistance levels, it could see a price increase toward $9.03 by the end of 2024. GoodEgg (GEGG): An Emerging Contender in the Social-Fi Space While Internet Computer (ICP) faces challenges, GoodEgg (GEGG) is thriving. Currently in the final stages of its presale, with 80% of Stage 1 already completed, GoodEgg (GEGG) is building the world’s first AI-powered digital dating platform. This Social-Fi crypto project is unique in its approach, combining meme coin appeal with real-world utility by creating a platform that rewards users for social interactions and dating activities. The digital dating platform offered by GoodEgg (GEGG) allows users to earn tokens by participating in dating-related tasks, with the added appeal of unlocking exclusive NFTs and gaining access to higher levels of engagement. With a current price of $0.00015, early investors are jumping on the opportunity, seeing GoodEgg (GEGG) as a project with both short-term hype and long-term potential. October 2024: ICP Facing Resistance, GoodEgg Gaining Traction As we head into October, Internet Computer (ICP) is expected to continue battling against bearish market sentiment. The on-chain metrics for Internet Computer (ICP) show resistance at key levels, with support barely holding at $7.04. If ICP cannot push through the $7.41 resistance, analysts believe the token could dip further, potentially testing lower levels in the $6 range. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG)) is expected to gain more traction as its presale nears completion. The project’s digital dating platform is generating buzz in the crypto community, especially with its AI-driven features and social scoring system that rewards users for engaging in the platform. As more users join the ecosystem, GoodEgg (GEGG) could see a significant price increase in the coming months, attracting both retail and institutional investors. November 2024: ICP Forecast and GoodEgg’s Continued Rise By November, the outlook for Internet Computer (ICP) remains uncertain. Some analysts predict that ICP could experience a slight rebound if it manages to hold above its $7.04 support level and see increased adoption from developers. However, the overall market sentiment remains bearish for ICP, with a price recovery to $9.03 dependent on a significant shift in market conditions and investor confidence. In contrast, GoodEgg (GEGG) is expected to continue its upward trajectory. With 80% of its presale already completed and growing interest from the crypto community, GoodEgg (GEGG) is set to become a leader in the Social-Fi space. Its innovative digital dating platform, combined with its strong community-driven approach, makes GoodEgg (GEGG) a project to watch in the final quarter of 2024. In Essence A Tale of Two Cryptos While Internet Computer (ICP) faces ongoing challenges in the market, GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to grow as an innovative and exciting project. With the completion of its presale and the launch of its digital dating platform on the horizon, GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to dominate the Social-Fi space. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios may want to consider GoodEgg (GEGG) as a strong contender for future growth, while ICP remains a more uncertain investment, requiring a market shift to realize its full potential.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Here’s Why Bitcoin Recovery Will 10x Popcat and GoodEgg, Whales Fill Bag at Price $0.00015",2024-09-11 18:00:55+00:00,"As the cryptocurrency market heats up, two meme coins are catching the attention of major investors: GoodEgg (GEGG) and Popcat (POPCAT). With Bitcoin’s recent recovery, the buzz around these two tokens has intensified, leading to speculation that their prices could soar. Whales are making significant moves, with one whale recently snapping up $50K worth of Popcat and another eyeing GoodEgg (GEGG), which is currently priced at $0.00015. GoodEgg (GEGG) – Gamifing Dating While Popcat (POPCAT) has been a dominant force, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a serious contender, offering something different with its Play-2-Date platform. As a meme coin that integrates A.I. and gamification, GoodEgg (GEGG) is attracting attention for its innovative features and growth potential. GoodEgg’s unique value proposition comes from its ability to combine meme culture with a practical use case, making it more than just another speculative token. The Play-2-Date platform allows users to earn rewards while interacting in a fun and engaging way, and the upcoming social scoring A.I. app has generated even more excitement. Priced at just $0.00015, GoodEgg is gaining traction among meme coin enthusiasts, with whales showing growing interest. How Popcat’s Recent Performance Affected it’s Price Movement Popcat (POPCAT) has been on a tear recently, surging by 3.2% in the last 24 hours and reaching $0.6216. This rapid growth came after the price found solid support at $0.4826, allowing buyers to push the token into a bullish momentum. Popcat’s rounding bottom pattern, combined with its strong performance above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), confirms a robust upward trend. According to data from GeckoTerminal, Popcat’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting at 66, approaching the overbought region of 70, indicating strong buying pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also in positive territory, signaling that the bulls are in control and pushing Popcat’s price upward. However, despite this momentum, a death cross has formed at $0.5617, a potential warning sign for the market. If conditions turn bearish, Popcat’s price could see a correction down to $0.5697, the 50-day SMA support level. Whale’s Fuelling Meme Rallying Speculation Whales, the deep-pocketed investors who can move markets, are getting in on the action. A whale recently purchased $50K worth of GoodEgg and Popcat, boosting the token’s trading volume and market cap. Meanwhile, other investors are turning their attention to GoodEgg, seeing it as the next big opportunity in the meme coin space. The combination of Bitcoin’s recovery, growing interest from whales, and the unique value propositions offered by GoodEgg and Popcat make both tokens attractive investments. However, GoodEgg’s integration of A.I. and social features sets it apart from the competition, positioning it as a potential market leader in the meme coin space. Last Thought As Popcat (POPCAT) and GoodEgg (GEGG) continue to rise, fueled by whale interest and Bitcoin’s recovery, both tokens are showing strong potential for significant gains. However, with GoodEgg’s innovative Play-2-Date platform and social scoring A.I. app, it could soon overshadow Popcat, offering investors a unique and exciting opportunity for growth. Whales are already filling their bags, and the market is watching closely as these meme coins battle it out for dominance.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bullish On Internet Computer: ICP Falls Short to New Contender GoodEgg After Announces AI Play to Date Meme Coin,2024-09-11 18:00:50+00:00,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to fierce competition, especially in the ever-evolving realms of artificial intelligence (AI) and meme coins. While Internet Computer (ICP) continues to be a prominent player in the AI blockchain space, the emergence of GoodEgg (GEGG)—an innovative AI-driven Play-to-Date meme coin—has drawn significant attention and could signal a shift in investor preferences. Internet Computer (ICP): A Stalwart in the AI Crypto Space Internet Computer (ICP) has long been regarded as one of the most advanced blockchain projects, with a focus on decentralizing the internet. With a current market capitalization of $3.72 billion, Internet Computer (ICP) has maintained its position as the second-largest AI coin. The project recently saw a 5% increase in value over the last 24 hours, indicating strong interest from investors. This growth aligns with the broader trend in AI cryptocurrencies, where coins like NEAR Protocol and Render have also seen significant upward movement in the same time frame. The AI sector is heating up as more blockchain projects integrate artificial intelligence into their ecosystems. Internet Computer’s (ICP) cutting-edge technology allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) without relying on centralized cloud services, a major selling point in today’s market. Despite these advantages, Internet Computer (ICP) faces growing competition from emerging projects like GoodEgg (GEGG), which is blending AI innovation with a fun, meme-inspired twist that could challenge Internet Computer’s (ICP) dominance. GoodEgg (GEGG): The AI Play-to-Date Meme Coin making a difference Enter GoodEgg (GEGG), a new contender in the AI-driven crypto space. What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from the competition is its unique combination of artificial intelligence and the social aspects of dating. With its “Play-to-Date” model, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers users a gamified dating experience, allowing them to earn rewards in the form of GEGG tokens as they engage in social interactions on the platform. This playful yet innovative approach is already capturing the imagination of investors. The presale for GoodEgg (GEGG) is seeing strong demand, with the AI-powered dating coin gaining traction in the crowded meme coin space. Its integration of AI allows for personalized matchmaking, enhancing user experience while providing real-world utility in the digital dating realm. The addition of AI to a meme coin adds credibility to GoodEgg (GEGG), allowing it to appeal to both the speculative meme coin community and the more utility-driven investors interested in artificial intelligence. By positioning itself as a hybrid between meme culture and technological innovation, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers something truly unique, giving it the potential to attract a broad audience. Why GoodEgg (GEGG) May Outperform ICP While Internet Computer (ICP) has a well-established presence in the AI blockchain world, GoodEgg (GEGG) is leveraging its innovative, fun, and rewarding ecosystem to position itself as a serious contender. Several factors contribute to the belief that GoodEgg (GEGG) could outperform Internet Computer (ICP) in the coming months: Engaging Use Case: The gamification of dating through a Play-to-Date model offers a fresh and engaging use case that attracts users and investors alike. Unlike Internet Computer’s (ICP) more technical applications, GoodEgg (GEGG) makes blockchain and AI accessible to everyday users looking for social interaction and entertainment. Meme Coin Appeal: The success of meme coins in recent years has shown that virality and community engagement can lead to massive gains. GoodEgg (GEGG) taps into this trend while adding utility through its AI-driven platform, making it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the meme coin hype. AI Integration: With artificial intelligence becoming a key focus in many industries, GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions. By incorporating AI into its matchmaking process, GoodEgg (GEGG) adds a layer of sophistication that sets it apart from other meme coins and makes it more appealing to a wider range of investors. Strong Presale Momentum: GoodEgg (GEGG)has seen significant interest during its presale phase, signalling strong investor confidence in the project. With more than 80% of the presale completed, the momentum behind GoodEgg (GEGG) is undeniable. Delivering Entertainment and Utility The insurgence of GoodEgg (GEGG) highlights a growing trend in the crypto space: the fusion of AI and meme coins. Investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer both entertainment value and real-world utility, and GoodEgg (GEGG) delivers on both fronts. While Internet Computer (ICP) continues to perform well in the AI crypto market, its more serious approach may limit its appeal to mainstream investors, especially those drawn to the viral nature of meme coins. As GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to gain traction, it has the potential to redefine what it means to be a meme coin in the age of AI. With its innovative platform, strong community backing, and investor interest, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to become a major player in the AI and meme coin spaces. ICP Forges On as Playful Meme Gains Speed While Internet Computer (ICP) remains a dominant force in the AI crypto sector, the emergence of GoodEgg (GEGG) as a playful yet innovative AI-driven meme coin is shaking things up. GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique proposition with its Play-to-Date model, combining the best of both worlds—AI and meme coin culture. As more investors take note, GoodEgg (GEGG) could very well surpass Internet Computer (ICP) and other AI coins, making it a project to watch in 2024.

One of the latest disruptors in the space is GoodEgg (GEGG), a hybrid AI and Social-Fi project that is quickly gaining traction. With 80% of its Stage 1 presale completed, GoodEgg (GEGG) is setting its sights on dominating the AI crypto sphere, drawing attention away from major players like Internet Computer (ICP) and Decide AI (DCD). GoodEgg’s (GEGG) Emerging as a Dominant Force GoodEgg (GEGG) combines artificial intelligence with a unique social scoring system, creating a one-of-a-kind platform that rewards users for their social interactions. This innovative approach has attracted a diverse group of investors, including whales that traditionally favored projects like ICP. The rapid growth of GoodEgg (GEGG), currently priced at $0.00015, is proving that its appeal stretches far beyond the typical meme coin hype. The success of GoodEgg (GEGG) has been driven by its AI-powered social features and the platform’s focus on user engagement. With AI capabilities integrated into its system, GoodEgg (GEGG) provides users with a seamless experience that rewards them for their participation, setting it apart from traditional meme coins. ICP Whales Shift Focus to GoodEgg (GEGG) and Other Projects In a recent shake-up, Internet Computer (ICP) whales have started diversifying their portfolios by investing in GoodEgg (GEGG), as well as other rising stars like Decide AI (DCD) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These whales, known for making long-term strategic investments, are increasingly drawn to GoodEgg’s innovative use of AI and blockchain technology. This shift in focus comes as ICP struggles to maintain its momentum. Despite its ambitious goal of decentralizing the internet, Internet Computer (ICP) has faced difficulties in reversing its downward price trend. According to recent analysis, Internet Computer (ICP) has seen resistance at the $7.41 level, with support lingering around $7.04. This ongoing bearish sentiment has caused some investors to seek alternatives, with GoodEgg (GEGG) emerging as a top choice. Investors choose Decide AI (DCD), GoodEgg (GEGG) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) for quick returns In addition to GoodEgg (GEGG), Internet Computer (ICP) whales have also turned their attention to Decide AI (DCD) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Decide AI has made significant strides in the AI blockchain space, recently deploying OpenAI’s GPT-2 model on-chain using ICP technology. This breakthrough has solidified Decide AI’s position as a leader in decentralized AI, attracting the attention of deep-pocketed investors. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has capitalized on its meme coin status, attracting both retail and whale investors. Its integration with GambleFi—a sector that merges blockchain technology with online gaming—has made it a favorite for those looking for quick returns. With its presale rapidly nearing completion, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already sold 67% of its tokens and is positioned for substantial growth. GoodEgg (GEGG) Storming Ahead with 80% of Stage 1 sold While Decide AI (DCD) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique value propositions, it is GoodEgg (GEGG) that has captured the attention of investors looking for a combination of AI innovation and community engagement. As GoodEgg (GEGG) approaches the completion of its Stage 1 presale, the platform’s growth potential is becoming increasingly apparent. The platform’s AI-driven social scoring system allows users to earn rewards through interactions, making it a compelling option for investors who see the value in blending AI with real-world applications. With more than 80% of its presale tokens sold, GoodEgg (GEGG) is on track to deliver significant returns for early investors. Additionally, as Internet Computer (ICP) struggles with market challenges, more ICP whales are turning their attention to GoodEgg (GEGG).  This shift signals that Internet Computer (ICP), while still relevant, may be facing increasing competition from innovative projects like GoodEgg. As a result, Internet Computer (ICP) investors are diversifying, seeing GoodEgg (GEGG) as a promising alternative in the AI crypto space. The Future of GoodEgg (GEGG) and the AI Crypto Space The growing interest from Internet Computer (ICP) whales and the broader crypto community signals that GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to challenge established AI and blockchain projects. As the platform continues to expand, it is likely to attract even more investors looking for a project that combines innovation, user engagement, and AI technology. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a rapidly growing project. With its innovative use of AI, strong community support, and the backing of major crypto investors, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to become a dominant force in the AI cryptocurrency space. As more whales and retail investors flock to GoodEgg (GEGG), the stage is set for the platform to disrupt the status quo and solidify its position as a leader in the AI-driven crypto world.

Reddit,solana,Urgent: Malicious Extension Targeting Solana Reddit,2024-08-19 20:35:42,"Hey everyone, Meow from Jupiter here.

Wanted to bring to everyone's urgent attention a chrome extension that has appears to be targeting Reddit users called ""**Bull Checker**"". If you have this installed, please uninstall this right away.

This software has drained quite a few people already:

[https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830](https://x.com/JupiterExchange/status/1825600323320434830)

Users with this extension would interact with the dApps as per normal, **have the simulation show up as normal**, but have the possibility of their tokens being maliciously transferred to another wallet upon transaction completion.

For full technical details, refer to my post here:

[https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/identification-of-malicious-extension/21584)

We believe that many reddit users might have gotten exposure to this extension because of a few postings by u/solana_og got a ton of visibility (tho he appears to have edited away mention of this extension)

[https:\/\/x.com\/SlorgoftheSlugs\/status\/1825617566489817182](https://preview.redd.it/lrmjelrwcojd1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7923fb2662d2dff88add75e3f87877585523ae)

The same user has been promoting Bull Checker many many times on reddit over past 2 weeks, so we fear that many users would have seen it by now.

Extensions are especially tricky because they have access to read/write data across anything you visit, so please do not install anything you don't 100% trust.

https://preview.redd.it/zmpp7gg1kojd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6891dfdd0e7c72a498f7ee570c0bd13ffb05a88a

Besides this, I am very sure that there are other extensions out there, it is just that this one is probably the most prominent now till to the effective marketing.

It breaks our hearts to have some users have a large amount of their hard earned savings from years of hard degening get drained, so **please please please stay safe**!",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Reddit,solana,Txn confirmation takes 19+ seconds despite swap executing in 2-4 seconds? Wut?,2024-09-11 21:30:19,"It's simple as that. I'm C# dev, making module to perform swaps, using [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) swap API (v6) + dedicated free RPC.

Everything seems to be just fine, txn's get in quite fast from what I see in charts, but in code actual ""confirmation"" takes 19+ seconds, always, despite me seeing new 1 second candle on chart in first 3-5 seconds after code enters in ""SendAndConfirmTransactionAsync"". Commitmment is used ""Finalized"".  
Line is:

    RequestResult<string> result = await rpcClient.SendAndConfirmTransactionAsync(
      preswapInfo.SignedTransaction, skipPreflight: true);

So, why is that?

This is NOT rpc/internet/pc whatever problem. This seems to be something with actual code and methodology with how txn's are confirmed and perhaps commitment thing.

In [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI after executing txn I literally see ""Your transaction was confirmed"" in same time as 1 second candle is displayed on chart, so, it confirms in same time.  
Why my solution is not working? Is [jup.ag](http://jup.ag) UI using other commitment for confirmations?  
Can anyone who KNOWS answer has ideas guide me on this one?

Reddit,solana,"I made a Solana memecoin tracking bot, and here's what I learned",2024-09-11 18:13:04,"Hey Solana fam! 👋

A while back, I shared a bot I made for tracking PumpFun graduates. Well, I've been working on it non-stop since then, and I wanted to share what I've learned along the way.

# The Journey

What started as a simple alert system has grown into a full-fledged trading companion. Here's what I discovered:

1. **Pump monitoring isn't enough.** Sure, it's exciting to catch new listings, but there's so much more to consider.
2. **Volume tells a story.** I added a volume analyzer and was shocked at how it revealed hidden gems across different market caps.
3. **Whales matter.** Tracking large trades (over $100k) has been eye-opening. It's fascinating to see how these moves can influence the market.
4. **One size doesn't fit all.** Everyone has their own trading style, so I made the alerts customizable.

# What I Built

Without turning this into an ad, here's what the bot can do now:

* Alert on new Raydium listings
* Provide daily and weekly rankings
* Analyze volume-to-FDV ratios
* Track whale movements
* Let users customize their notifications

# The Biggest Lesson

The most important thing I've learned? **On-chain data is king.** No paid promos, no shilling, just pure data. It's been a game-changer for my own trading.

# What's Next?

I'm constantly tweaking and improving based on feedback. If you're interested in checking it out or have ideas for new features, let me know! The bot's called MemeToolsAlertBot on Telegram.

Has anyone else built tools for trading? What insights have you gained? Let's share knowledge and elevate the whole community!

P.S. Obligatory reminder: Always DYOR. No bot or tool can replace your own judgment. Stay safe out there, folks! 🛡️",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Reddit,solana,📉 Traders to Avoid When Copy Trading on Solana:,2024-09-11 18:22:17,"
1. Scalper Traders: Their trades typically last less than a minute, making it unprofitable to copy them with free copy trading bots due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)

2. Traders with Numerous Buys: If a trader makes more than 4-5 buys, it becomes challenging to manage money effectively. For instance, if you allocate 10% of your deposit per trade and the trader makes 7-9 buys of a scam token, you could lose 70-90% of your assets.

3. Mixed Token Traders: These traders receive tokens from other wallets and also purchase tokens themselves. Their profit and loss (PnL) on trades may be higher than yours due to tokens received from external sources.

4. Token snipers: These traders buy tokens at the start of their market appearance (first candle). Using free copy trading bots with them can lead to losses due to delays. (Recommended to copy only with private copy trading bots.)",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

* Messari
* Arkham

# Technical analysis techniques:

* **Fundamental analysis**: Evaluate a project's technology (if any), the team's historic performance, and its adoption roadmap to understand its potential.
* **Technical analysis**: Using indicators and chart patterns to predict price movements and trends in the crypto market.
* **Sentimental analysis**: By analyzing social media and news outlets, this gives a sense of the market sentiment for some insights.

**More:**

* **Social media monitoring:** Platforms like Twitter and Reddit offer a glimpse into public sentiment. Tools like Cointelegraph Markets Pro analyze these conversations.
* **News analysis:** Reviewing news articles helps traders understand how recent events impact market sentiment.
* **Fear and greed index:** This tool scores market sentiment from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), serving to give guidance for the market mood.
* **Whale monitoring:** Observing large transactions can provide hints about the shifts in market sentiment.

So a user can join a ""list"" (by some sort of cmd) and he then gets an address where he can send money to. Each user has his own address, this is to keep track of everything and keep it organized. Now, the problem I had when sending transactions on the devnet is, that these new empty accounts need to have some funds at first so they can accept new funds from the user. As far as I understood this is for the rent.

>Transaction results in an account (1) with insufficient funds for rent

But why can't this rent be taken from the first transaction the user makes to that address? Why does it need funds prior to that? I fixed it by using an airdrop, but since I'm only on the devnet I'm unsure if this will even work on the mainnet.

1. Why are zero indexes of pre and post Balances different, but any other are rather not, are they not filled?



2. Where can I find addresses of wallets, that are sending transactions, in given block, together with the amounts and addresses, they are sending the transactions to?

But I can't able to buy it with my fiat currency. But made purchase of USDT in binance worth of 20 dollars.and exchanged it to solana.

But why is it though I can't buy it with my fiat money in binance unlike coinbase. And what's with usdt/sol exchange can't we buy sol directly?",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Don't get me wrong, but spending 0.002 SOL per wallet it's expensive af for making a huge airdrop.

For sure it's useful in terms of marketing, but why wouldn't you make a claim site, it's much cheaper and efficient?

Even more, it's also cheap, you can hire a dev or do it without coding with no-code platforms like Smithii.

Reddit,solana,Lock SPL or LP token on Solana,2024-09-10 19:06:19,"Now anybody can lock SPL token or lock LP tokens on smithii tools.

Also apply a vesting period to an amount of your Solana token supply and set a receiver wallet.

The tool is [Solana Token Vesting](https://tools.smithii.io/token-vesting/solana)

What would you use it for? Is there a vesting strategy to improve a token project success? 

Also, it is good choise to lock a LP token instead of burn it?

Reddit,solana,Crypto Solana portfolio management: balancing risk and reward,2024-09-10 23:24:15,"Managing a Solana portfolio requires a careful balance between risk and reward (profits you want and losses you can afford). Many investors struggle with maintaining this balance, often due to a lack of risk management strategies and knowledge.

Here are key pointers for effective cryptocurrency portfolio management:

1. **Diversification across cryptos:** While major players like Solana, Ethereum and Bitcoin are common, consider including promising altcoins/memecoins to spread risk or even to optimize upsides.
2. **Market volatility and regulations:** Staying informed about market trends and regulations is relatively easy considering a small change can heavily impact your portfolio performance, you don’t want to be late on the big news when they happen.
3. **Setting clear goals:** You need short-term and long-term plans. Focus on strategic growth and keep track of your gains with a real possible plan to get there. Betting on luck is not enough to stay aligned with your investment objectives.
4. **Rebalancing your portfolio:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain the level of risk and reward you think is okay.
5. **Risk strategy**: Have a good risk strategy to compensate for high fluctuations and unexpected events, as crypto is mostly about those two types of events. Successful traders excel at predicting the unpredictable, which is different from traditional stock investing.
6. **Take profits and cut losses:** Don’t stay too long in a position when you’ve hit your target or your limit, remember the long-term game!
7. **Market caps variety**: Invest in a mix of large, mid, and small-cap cryptocurrencies depending on your strategy and expectations. Consulting successful traders can guide you towards what kind of market caps you should look at based on your objectives.
8. **Asset variety**: NFTs and DeFi staking can be considered for Solana traders to diversify your portfolio, yet consider how the macro trends impact the volume and performance of NFTs versus tokens.

Reddit,solana,🌟 Optimal wallet traits and tips for copy trading on Solana,2024-09-10 14:08:52,"📊 Solid ROI:
Aim for wallets with a ROI above 100%. This increases a change of success even with some percentages lost due to copy trade bots delays.

🏆 High WinRate:
Look for a win rate over 60%. This indicates a trader with consistent profitable trades. Combine ROI and WinRate for a clear picture of profitability.

🛒 Low Buys Amount:
It is easier to manage traders with average buys per trade less than 3.
Copy trade bots usually have 2 settings for buys:
1 - fixed amount in sol
2 - percent of trader's buy
In both cases you’ll get a high level of spread between your positions from trade to trade if you choose a wallet which makes a lot of buy transactions per trade.

⏱️ Longer Trade Durations:
Trades held for more than a minute are easier to copy because of less dependence on micro-scale price changes.

🌐 Realistic Expectations:
Copying trades doesn’t guarantee identical results. Factors like bot speed, blockchain congestion, market cap, and original trader’s buy size can affect the outcome.


💡 Final Tips:
🟢Start small and test. If results are positive, gradually increase your position size.
🟢Use different Telegram accounts to have clear statistics on each trader you copy.
🟢Track your journey on the paper or use Excel/Google Sheets.",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

Reddit,solana,Spot breakout patterns: a guide for Solana crypto smart traders,2024-09-10 15:33:58,"Trading crypto on Solana is complex, so understanding breakout patterns can be valuable info for smart traders. A breakout occurs when a crypto’s price moves beyond a defined support or resistance level, it can be a potential shift in the market trends.

Here are some key breakout patterns that can assist crypto traders:

* **Avoid weak breakouts:** Weak breakouts may lack the volume necessary to sustain momentum, leading to false signals. Always ensure that a breakout is supported by significant trading volume to confirm its strength.
* **Continuation breakouts:** These occur when the price breaks in the direction of the prevailing trend. They are useful for confirming a trend change. Continuation breakouts often signal that the current trend will persist, providing opportunities for traders to enter or exit positions strategically.
* **Reversal breakouts:** Reversal breakouts happen when a price trend changes direction, either from an uptrend to a downtrend or vice versa. It's crucial to analyze the current trends and determine which are reaching their peak or bottom levels to identify potential reversal points.

Using tools like trading signals can further help in taking fast decisions to find and time these breakouts more easily.",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Reddit,solana,Technical analysis for smart Solana crypto trading,2024-09-09 22:13:28,"Here are the essential knowledge about effective TA and indicators to improve your strategies on Solana:

# Price charts and candlesticks

Get familiar with price charts and candlestick patterns to start understanding how successful traders read price action. It’s essential for identifying the latest trends and potential reversals in the price actions. Candlestick patterns offer some level of insights.

# Support and resistance levels

Good entry and exit strategies can come from understanding how support and resistance works. Support levels indicate where a cryptocurrency's price might find a “floor”, while resistance levels show where upward price movements “could” stall. Breakouts can be faked, and they can tell that something big is coming too.

# Basic key indicators for smart trading

* **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Spot changes in market direction over time.
* **Volume Analysis:** Track trading volumes to confirm trends and trading signals. High trading volumes can indicate strong interest in a particular direction, but pay caution as these can be manipulated by scammers.

Remember, while these indicators can guide your decisions, they do not guarantee success. Adapt fast to what works best!",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Including all the token names and transaction date/times?   The info appears clearly in the transaction hash details.  Does Solflare have a usable download button?  I only see the history page with no DL option.  Printing the PDF of that page failed.

I've downloaded the SOL and the SPL files from Solscan but they are not something you can follow easily and they don't include time or token names.  The individual transx hash have all the info, so it seems it should be easy to extract a summary for each transx. of all time without doing it manually.

I'm trying to do taxes and reconcile 1,000+ Solana transactions which were done using Solflare+ Ledger together.  99% are scam airdrops.  Ledger is useless as most transactions don't show in it's transaction history.

I'm using Cointracking..info  Solana address upload, which makes it pretty easy to sift through, but you're still left with a bunch of ""transfers"" which must be converted to swaps to establish cost basis. I want to make sure everything is done correctly.

Any suggestions on how to do this?   Generally, you would take any transactions with the same time stamp and merge them, but with all that info in Solscan I don't know why I'm doing it manually.   My next step was going to be to download the Cointracking transaction file and merge the dep/withdraws of same time stamp into ""trades"".  I'm hoping there is a shortcut.

Reddit,solana,Why auto downloads are risky on Solana,2024-09-09 01:53:55,"No wallet, no way to interact with the blockchain or with an exchange (CEX or DEX). Imagine if simply downloading an image can drain your crypto wallet?

Automatic downloads on messaging apps can compromise your private keys and drain your crypto wallets if they contain malicious code. They can also expose your device to malware. By avoiding auto-downloads, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access and hackers.

Phishing attacks pose another threat to your crypto journey. Cybercriminals create fake sites and apps that mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Auto-downloads can install these malicious apps, compromising your wallet. Verify the authenticity of any site or app before downloading and disable auto-downloads on all devices.

# How to protect your crypto wallet

1. **Disable auto-downloads on all devices and applications:** Do not skip this step!
2. **Use a hardware wallet:** For optimal security, store your private keys offline with a hardware wallet. A small step to protect a bit more against online threats.
3. **Choose reputable crypto exchanges:** Research every platform before selecting an exchange (both CEX and DEX) that you like, some have a bigger history of losing customer funds than others.
4. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):** Improve your crypto wallet security with 2FA or MFA whenever its possible, why not?

What do you think?

He said we are bridging from Fantom (where I supposedly had some wbtc). I would need to deposit solana and i'd get this ETH on Solana. 

Red flags:

- I don't see the bridge (I don't understand much though)

- the transfers of this address are weird.. much of my SOL goes to [this ](https://solscan.io/account/AwQAxJVJx3KVe567FgX6reUa6BEgcyrWFd7gcTRh8xpy)address where it seems to be spent on crap. (play flip gg wtf?)

Reddit,solana,Is anyone here an admin/mod of a Discord community on Solana?,2024-09-08 12:33:57,"Hey everyone,  
I tend to see a lot of Discord communities emerge for projects on Solana. I have personally also been involved with Discord crypto communities since a long time ago and I also have some experience building Discord bots.

As part of the recent [Blinkathon](https://blinkathon.fun) hackathon I have built the [Blinkord](https://blinkord.com) platform - Solana Blinks meet Discord. It's a platform where Discord server owners can create their own shareable link and enable their community members to gain access to paid/exclusive content in only a few clicks and through Solana's Blinks, which can be done from anywhere.

The point of Blinkord is to replace the need for using centralized platforms to offer premium content on Discord and make it very easy for the community members to obtain exclusive roles which grant them access, highly increasing the conversion rate for the purchases.

It is currently in the MVP phase and I am trying to get as much feedback as possible to validate my idea and also to see if there is enough demand from Discord server admins or mods to use such a tool to offer premium content to their community members.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback and would love to hear your thoughts, thanks!!

Reddit,solana,URL previews and verifying links before clicking for Solana crypto safety,2024-09-07 14:17:56,"Solana trading is already risky enough as our asset class is very speculative and high in movement, the worst would be to also fall victim to scams due to a lack of attention to security. 

A simple way to avoid getting scammed is to be very cautious about the links you click. The basis of scams in crypto is often designed to exploit your desire for a quick buck and carelessness.

To avoid significant financial losses, pay attention for a few minutes and keep your wallet intact by being vigilant and taking proactive steps.



Here's a guide to help you protect yourself with unknown links:

**Unknown links are not your friends**

Your favorite and other known trading crypto bots are often impersonated by fake bots. If you don’t double-check the right link/username for a trading bot, you’re likely to send your funds somewhere that doesn’t belong to you, or at least with the capacity to return these assets back to yourself. 

Avoid clicking on every link you come across, as doing so could lead to your personal information being compromised or even your computer being infiltrated with malware. With one click, a ton can happen. Do not underestimate the impact of one click. Prioritize security to protect your investments above all.



**Using token scanners and explorers**

To verify the legitimacy of a token and its official links, use tools like token sniffers and blockchain explorers to preview the legit URLs, allowing you to trade the right smart contract and follow the right social media profiles.



**CEXs and DEXs can be impersonated too**

Even if you have used a platform a thousand times, make sure to bookmark the legit URLs of the platforms you use to avoid ever giving your login information to a fake website pretending to be the exchange you use. Bookmarking URLs is an easy practice to keep you safe.

Reddit,ethereum,Use Case is Central on ETH's Road to Internet Money or Value Store,2024-09-09 19:53:10,"I posted a comment on why ETH shall not go down the road of ATOM. Surprisingly this topic is very contentious and I would like to have a chance to further elaborate my thoughts:

**(1) ETH's road to Internet Money**

There is no question that ETH needs to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant as Vitalik argued on the road to Internet Money. But is this enough? Guys from Defi camp like Uniswap, Frax, Lido have argued that Defi is critical part of that road. I would argue ETH needs to stay relevant as the central of Crypto chain activities, be it Defi or NFT or anything new. Otherwise early adopters will jump to other ecosystems and wide adoption will go straight into that ecosystem when the time comes. If a system is not used or not as performant or convenient to use, why would anyone trust it as internet money?

**(2) ETH's road to Value Store**

Still, there is no question that Ethereum chain has to stay decentralized and censorship-resistant for value storage. But ETH coin is inseparable from Ethereum chain, then if ETH is losing its user case as argued in (1), why could anyone use it as value store? Value store is still a store of things of value, and people needs to have incentives to hold ETH. And more, it cannot be use cases that does not accrete value to ETH, as what $ATOM failed at with its best giving-out-for-free Cosmos SDK. That people started to use Bitcoin as value store was because Bitcoin had a unique user case - the first chain that is decentralized and censorship-resistant and can handle payment. ETH came second, then decentralized and censorship-resistant alone would not be enough, and use cases & value accretion will have to be there to drive ETH adoption.

So even if ETH goal is value store, it still needs to become Internet Money first. Like US Dollar is international money as today, but foreign countries holding it as value store is not because it is value store, it's because they need to use USD for payment. Foreign countries mostly held GBP 100 years ago.",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

I’m not looking for a one-off instance where you used Etheruem in some edge case, but rather a way that you use Ethereum every day that adds value to your life and improves upon a traditional method of accomplishing the same task. 

When researching online, I’ll see examples like betting: You can bet on if it will rain or not tomorrow. Traditionally you would need to trust the loser to pay the winner or if it's a third party to not run away with it. We can avoid this by writing code and by both depositing 100$ for example. When the code sees that yes in fact it did rain, it will automatically transfer the 200$ to the winner. But let’s be real, nobody is actually doing this lol. Plus, you’d have to trust whatever 3rd party module is verifying if it actually rained, and there might be disagreements depending on the module used. Meaning, there will still be elements of the protocol to contest. And humans or other 3rd parties will need to intermediate anyways, eliminating the whole idea of a smart contract. It doesn’t seem realistic. 

Other people say ETH is a global computer, and you can rent computation processing power. But once again, what average joe is actually doing this? I could see maybe some mathematician PhD guy needing to calculate the next prime number. But the average person never needs that much computer power to begin with. 

So I’m back to this, what are you using Ethereum for right now in your daily life? What traditional model did it replace for you? How has it improved your life?

Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

Are there any good learning materials to the basic stuff to know?



Some of my initial questions are stuff like:



I hear L2 is ideal for lower fees, should I be converting my ETH directly to rETH, or first converting the ETH to L2, then to rETH? Can L2 ETH always be converted back to L1?



If I happen to have L2 ETH and I accidentally send it to an exchange's L1 address, am I loosing coins, or are there checks and balances in place to prevent mistakes like that from happening?



Or If I'm swapping ETH to another coin like BTC, does it have to be on the main net?



Is there a smart way to test out and learn how this all works hands on? Like should I test with small amounts of tokens, or use Testnet?

Reddit,ethereum,Why Aren't There More Junior Smart Contract Developer Positions? ,2024-09-05 19:53:59,"
I'm curious about why there seem to be so few opportunities for junior smart contract developers.

I understand that smart contract development requires a solid understanding of blockchain and security pitfalls, but if companies aren't offering junior roles, how are developers supposed to gain that experience?

Most of the companies are asking for 5 years of experience in blockchain and 5 years in front-end development.

How can people who are just starting to learn this technology stay motivated if there are no opportunities to break into the field?

1.

Reddit,ethereum,"Digital Asset Staking: What is it and how it works, simply. ",2024-08-27 13:36:33,"**Background:** Blockchain networks rely on a spread-out system of computers running constantly and are approving new transactions before adding it to the irreversible blockchain. There are two main types of blockchains: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

Why would someone want to do this and do it by the rules? Miners are incentivized through rewards and bear risks when mining. If they act honestly, efficiently, and correctly, they receive Bitcoin as a reward. If they don’t, they lose money due to electricity costs and the initial capital investment required to set up their equipment.

**Proof of Work (PoW):** This is used by Bitcoin. People use computers to solve complex puzzles. When done honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Proof of Stake (PoS):** This is used by Ethereum. People (validators) stake their Ethereum and are rewarded with additional Ethereum in the future for validating transactions.

Both blockchains rely on a **consensus mechanism**—a method that allows a bunch of random people and computers to reach overall agreement on various matters. This process helps ensure trust, security, and consensus across the blockchain.

**Proof of Work Overview:** Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners (people running computers constantly) use electricity and capital to verify and add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. If they perform this task honestly and correctly, they are rewarded with Bitcoin, though the reward amount decreases every four years (a process known as halving). The downside of PoW is that it uses a lot of money and electricity to keep running. *This high resource consumption is one reason why Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) for its digital assets.*

**Proof of Stake Overview**: Because Proof of Work (PoW) was considered too costly by many in the space, the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS) was developed. Ethereum now uses this method. In PoS, people stake their Ethereum to earn rewards over time. PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. Instead of buying and setting up multiple computers to mine Bitcoin, you only need a wallet and an account on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (though using these platforms typically involves transferring ownership and paying fees). This approach makes staking more accessible to everyday people, whereas Bitcoin mining has evolved into a large-scale industry, pushing out hobbyist miners. As more people participate in staking, the network’s security increases. 

**Terms to know**

**Staking Lock-Up Periods**: This refers to the length of time your Ethereum will be locked in a custody account, during which you won’t be able to sell or transfer it.

**Staking Minimums:** Running your own Ethereum staking node (without using a service like Coinbase or Gemini) is more complex and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum to start staking. If you use a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Gemini, you can stake any amount since funds are pooled together to meet the 32 Ethereum requirement.

**Staking Withdraw Time:** This is the time it takes to un-stake your ETH. The minimum withdrawal period is 28 hours, but it can vary depending on the staking provider you use",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790
Reddit,ethereum,Where can i check Holders ?,2024-08-26 12:55:53,"Hello :)

How can I find out how many coins different wallets hold? For example, with USDT, I can see that Binance holds the most coins. However, when I check other tokens, the ""Holders"" button doesn't appear. It would be very useful to see this information to check if, for example, the developers hold most of the coins, and so on.

Thank You

Reddit,ethereum,DCA Out Question,2024-08-25 14:02:17,"As the title states, i'm curious whether DCA'ing out some of my ETH is feasible and how it'll impact my portfolio in the future when ETH blows up.

I currently hold ( Amount) in ETH with an average cost of $2340. I've run into some financial issues (layoff/exhausted unemployment) and am hoping to liquidate some of my holdings to sustain myself and my family.

My question is, if I hypothetically sold $1000 profit per withdrawal and left my principal deposit dollar amount untouched, is this a smart tactic for DCA'ing out? Also, will withdrawing $1000 per transaction increase my future cost average as well? Will this reduce my profit margins in the future as my quantity of ETH ownership decreases?

I realize the quantity of ETH that I own will get smaller but as long as the market value continues to increase, I should hypothetically be able to keep DCA'ing out profit, if needed?

At the end of the day, i'm a firm believer in ETH and am extremely bullish. My goal is to maintain my principal deposit amount but only pull profits.
Please let me know if i'm headed in the wrong direction here or may be looking at this process the wrong way.

Need help troubleshooting the issue.  
I am trying to implement wallet generation and signing using an HSM.  I'm currently developing against SoftHSM2, with C#.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm running into troubles with ""Invalid Sender""

Hey Ethereum Devs,

I'm currently working on integrating a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to sign Ethereum transactions, and I've run into a persistent ""Invalid Sender"" error that I can't seem to resolve. I’m hoping the community might have some insights or suggestions.

# Background:

I'm using an HSM to securely generate and store Ethereum keys, and then to sign transactions. The process involves retrieving the public and private keys from the HSM, creating a transaction, signing it, and then sending it to the Ethereum network.

Here’s a summary of the workflow:

1. **Retrieve Public Key Info:** I retrieve the public key and its associated label from the HSM based on the Ethereum address.
2. **Generate Transaction Hash:** I use the `Sha3Keccack` hash function to create a message hash from the public key.
3. **Initial Signature:** I generate an initial signature with the retrieved private key using the message hash.
4. **Create Transaction:** I build a `LegacyTransaction` object with the transaction parameters like nonce, gas price, gas limit, etc.
5. **Recompute Transaction Hash:** The transaction hash is recomputed, including the Chain ID to ensure EIP-155 compliance.
6. **Final Signature:** I generate the final signature with the recomputed transaction hash.
7. **Adjust V for EIP-155:** The `V` value is adjusted as per EIP-155 (i.e., `V = finalSignature.V + Chain ID * 2 + 35`).
8. **Apply Final Signature:** I set the final signature on the transaction and serialize it.
9. **Send Transaction:** The serialized transaction is sent to the Ethereum network.

# The Problem:

Despite the transaction being created and signed correctly (as far as I can tell), when I submit it, I consistently get an ""Invalid Sender"" error.

# Debugging Data:

Here’s some of the debug output:

* **Public Key Info:** `Address=0xd2de6f19109d613f17496837e03909ad26632081`, `Label=test`
* **Message Hash:** `dd5e1cc957e9cf152b8e6d7ef12160622a31b329cad932d57998e9334ef0495a`
* **Initial Signature:** `R=0EE8B7B9FE8DAC6267ABADAA5F339D234A4B3CB4BAE4FC3BC31B619A8C726946F`, `S=641FEBC235A4EECA13597671AC5B1A32314D4DD07ABD84F074A93AAC674F77C2`, `V=28`
* **Recovered Address v27:** `0x0D9D930AC4Af2EdB21369c0A362F8c813264B85b`
* **Recovered Address v28:** `0xD2DE6F19109D613f17496837e03909aD26632081` (This is the correct one)
* **Transaction Hash:** `2f0028f56b6e1550d7a34e5da3048ef4ecda121004c38135f276ff7293a6e0db`
* **Final Signature:** `R=76AB822FD1B3D61C0C261B5FEEE33014F95EB658B93412FB8E2C8222C79CB91F`, `S=0811F55B97C7D97253CFD39B76B3A244C612BBEBB13BA76BD2160AFE6C6853FF9`, `V=141`

Despite the correct address being recovered with `V=28`, the transaction still results in an ""Invalid Sender"" error when the signed transaction is submitted.

# Code Snippet:

Here’s the critical part of the code where I believe the issue might be:

    csharpCopy codevar vValue = (byte)(finalSignature.V + _chainId * 2 + 35);
    transaction.SetSignature(new Signature
    {
        R = finalSignature.R,
        S = finalSignature.S,
        V = new byte[] { vValue }
    });
    var serializedTx = transaction.GetRLPEncoded().ToHex();

# What I’ve Tried:

* **Checked V Calculation:** Confirmed that the `V` value is calculated as per EIP-155.
* **Address Recovery:** Verified that the correct address is recovered with `V=28`.
* **Serialized Transaction:** Compared the serialized transaction output with a known good transaction; it looks correct.

# Community Help:

I'm stumped at this point. Does anyone have experience with HSMs and Ethereum transactions? Could it be an issue with the way I’m applying the signature or something subtle in the transaction serialization?

Any advice, suggestions, or pointers would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help! 🙏

Updates:

I've made some progress.

The NEthereum has the LegacyTransactionChainId Class, which should be used for EIP-155.

I am finally able to ""sometimes"" post transactions, and sometimes I get Invalid Signature.

**Invalid Signature Example:**

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.

* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,Question from a Newbie trying to obtain a greater understanding of BTC fundamentals. ,2024-09-11 19:26:22,"Newbie here, I’m currently reading a book to try and better understand crypto and BTC specifically. You seem to have a solid understanding.

As I have learned more, I truly believe btc and blockchain technology is an incredible technology and its impact has only just begun.

My one question right now regards mining and the process of validating the blocks. This aspect seems like the one potentially major issue. I read that approximately 80% of the hash power used to validate blocks is contributed by just 4 groups based in china. The issue of their location doesn’t alarm me, but rather the major disparity in validators. As consolidation happens and a greater percent of blocks are validated by less and less nodes, a point of centralization forms and therefore the opportunity for manipulation/censorship, correct? Wouldn’t this pose a considerable problem?

The book is The basics of bitcoins and blockchains by Antony Lewis, 2018.",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790
Reddit,bitcoin,Here’s How Bitcoin Fixes Healthcare in America | NiHowdy 🤠,2024-09-10 21:46:00,"Hey Bitcoiners,

I wanted to share my thoughts on how Bitcoin can fix healthcare, especially in pharmacy. As a Pharmacist, I've seen firsthand the flaws in the drug industry that drive up costs unnecessarily. Here's why and how Bitcoin can help fix this.

I used to own a community pharmacy and often had customers who paid out of pocket because they lacked insurance. Even my patients with insurance had limited financial means. I felt it was right to offer medications at my cost or for free (if it was de minimus). However, I received notice from an insurance payor about clawing back funds because I provided walk-in customers a better price than the insurance company. I faced the tough decision of either paying this exorbitant clawback or being terminated from the network, which would prevent me from serving other patients.

From that day, I learned that pharmacies must bill retail pricing regardless of the customer. Pharmacies often enter into contracts with insurance companies that include a most favored nation clause, requiring insurance companies to receive the best price possible.

As a legal loophole, pharmacies use “discount cards” to offer discounted prices while complying with insurance payors. Most people don't realize these discount cards collect hefty commissions, up to 80% on the drugs you buy at the pharmacy, paid for by the consumer. Without these discount cards and contractual verbiage, prescriptions would be much cheaper. For instance, GoodRx makes over $500 million a year from this system, and even Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs uses a similar model. In my opinion, this is one of the largest rent-seeking industries in America. Last year, pharmacies spent over half a billion dollars on commissions, which highlights a huge inefficiency with prescription drugs.

In the 1990s, big retailers like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Target started $4 generic med programs to attract customers, which worked well. Insurance companies got upset about paying $40 for the same meds, leading to the implementation of the most favored nation clause among pharmacies. Since the 90s, the Prescription Discount Card industry has grown as meds get more expensive and insurance covers less. This messed-up system won't change, and government reform is unlikely.

[I got Bitcoin back at Rite-Aid!](https://preview.redd.it/iq2vus9sw1od1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e77d8fab8eaf2953e69bbd0a68a88ccb442aa2)

This led me to create [NiHowdy.com](http://NiHowdy.com) We're a prescription savings card that gives the same discounted prices as others but also returns the transaction fees and drug manufacture rebates to you. No one else in the industry does this. We can do it thanks to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

1. **Micro-transactions:** Bitcoin on the Lightning Network allows for high-volume micro-transactions, challenging the high fees from third-party companies. For example, we got a $10 drug for a customer and paid back a 3% rebate in Bitcoin—about 30 cents. You can't do that by mail since postage costs more. Electronic payments like PayPal need at least 30 cents to $1, plus a percentage, making drug rebates impossible. You can’t do shit with fiat.
2. **Zero Net Cost Drugs:** I’m preaching to the choir here but Bitcoin is an asset. There’s a finite number of Bitcoin, and growing global participation. I believe its value will rise in the future. With delayed gratification, Bitcoin’s value can offset prescription costs. Meanwhile, the U.S. government spends over $400 billion annually on prescription drugs, yet they aren’t free for everyone. Everyone pays into the system, but few benefit. We’ve been running NiHowdy as an MVP since 2022. Some early users have offset their prescription costs by 10% already.

I love Bitcoin. It has the power to change the world. I believe Bitcoin can solve out-of-pocket prescription costs—something our government can’t even solve. This ‘prescription discount card’ industry will sadly never die, but I think Bitcoin makes it more efficient for the end user/consumer.

If you or someone you know pays for prescriptions out of pocket in America, check out NiHowdy. We're releasing our second product, Meowdy, for pet prescriptions soon.

Thanks for reading. If you’re a Bitcoiner in healthcare, I’d love to connect. I often get ridiculed by healthcare providers for even talking about Bitcoin, but it brings me immense joy to find others who share the same enthusiasm. Shout out to my local Bitcoin group for encouraging me to post this on Reddit 😊

Cheers!

Reddit,bitcoin,"The Distinctive Feature of Bitcoin Compared to Fiat Money isn't Scarcity, Is it?",2024-09-11 16:17:32,"Bitcoiners often argue that Bitcoin's unique value proposition is its scarcity compared to fiat. My stance today is that this is not the correct distinction. Isn’t the key difference that Bitcoin is limited (max 21M), while fiat is not? 

Scarcity describes the relationship between supply and demand—so in that sense, even hyperinflated money can be scarce because demand is always higher than supply. Money is inherently scarce. When money is hyperinflated there is a lot of money with very low purchasing power, so for those who need and want to buy things the demand for money is still higher than the supply otherwise hyperinflation would be beneficial for us. 

What makes Bitcoin truly unique is its **limited supply**: it has a hard cap of 21 million coins that **cannot be altered**, unlike fiat, which can be expanded at will by central authorities.

Reddit,bitcoin,DCA+HODL only BTC is making more sense than ever when considering increasing global taxation. ,2024-09-10 13:19:52,"As governments all over the world move to endorse 'crypto"" and the industry through it's taxation... the bull case for just hodl'n **only** BTC gets stronger.

At first many governments and the mainstream financial world tried to FUD Bitcoin out of existence but of course that didn't work. The second phase is trying to stifle Bitcoin and the wider crypto sector through onerous legislation and increased taxation. 

When it comes to regulation as we know from the BTC ETFs Vs SEC, Bitcoin has again survived and thrived. Almost every government in the world has now fully endorsed Bitcoin through their taxation policies that surround it. In the aftermath of a global pandemic all governments are keener than ever to raise taxes to pay down budget deficits. However for most governments taxation hasn't only been restricted to just Bitcoin, rather all of crypto and it's industry. Historically governments have used long-term taxation to silently cripple things they don't want/ like in society. Over the years many have laid the foundation to do just that on crypto.. however once more BTC will not only survive...but thrive. 

There's a growing push by governments to ensure people are paying crypto taxes. Where years ago they silently laid the foundations for crypto tax legislation, these days they are getting increasingly vocal in pointing them out and enforcement. All the major exchanges have been visited by major global tax authorities and confirmed their intention to work with them and provide them information where requested. 

More crypto related tax compliance software exists than ever as do accountants selling crypto as a specialism. Be it losses or gains with the changing crypto tax landscape more individual investors than ever are being dragged into the need to report crypto taxes. Interestingly, those with messy portfolio's with thousands of altcoin transactions creating variable capital gains and losses and many with thousands of fragments of staking rewards will suffer the greatest financial burden/ stress.. enough to say.. f**k this, I'm going Bitcoin Maxi. 

For the most part as an easy to store,  highly divisible and liquid asset that for most typical users may only be likely to have to report on the odd capital gain.. Bitcoin is simple, effective and easy. Both as an asset and when it comes to tax. 

Real estate, Classic cars, precious metals etc ate often highly investable and make good stores of long-term value however Bitcoin is much more manageable. As capital gains tax across the world are increased HODL makes increasing sense. 

TL;DR

Dumping messy portfolio alts that onerous taxes may need reported on and avoiding investment in illiquid high maintenance assets when it comes to increasing global tax burdens means buying and hodling BTC is starting to make more sense than ever. 

Bitcoin maximalism has a very bright future. ",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

I would like to run a node.  For all the various reasons, one of which is to get a better understanding of the underpinnings of how BTC functions.  Hearing and reading is only taking me so far.  It would also be nice to verify transactions. 

Can i do this with just any machine with enough memory?  Will a raspberry pi work or an old phone or old laptop?  I understand theres a pruned down version, so is it necessary to have the whole history or just from the day you start and what gets loaded then? 

Next, cause im broke, i would like to mine.  I am stacking but my years are most likely less than the average weekly dca.  I obviously cant afford a rig but i can scrape couch change or sell plasma to get a bitaxe.  Yes i know thats like winning lotto, but i could also make a few pennies if i join a pool. Plus, again, ill be learning.  Very important. 

Lastly, my sidehustle ive been getting paid in paypal.  I really want to keep hodling but i also realize that its important to me, and some of us i imagine, to get the circular economy going and growing. I understand companies like zaprite are meant for businesses to facilitate exchange and conversion and accounting.  Im not sure this is something i need.  Ive got analysis paralysis when it comes to hot wallets and was just gonna pick one and wing it to get my feet wet.  Ive had proton mail for a few years and when i heard they are about to release a wallet as well as a bunch of other useful tools i was excited for that.  So my second question is, for a simple side gig wouldnt just accepting BTC with a wallet be sufficient? Or is there a smarter, safer, better way?  Also, am i being short sighted not accepting other crypto which will be a pain cause then ill need to run it thru an exchange to convert to BTC.  Maybe thats a bad idea.  Or what about lightning? Thats cheaper to transact and would that be easier to use as a payment from and to others?  See it all starts to overwhelm and I get undecided and just put it off.  Im so tired of not doing this i cant stand it and have decided to ask for advice.  

Any thoughts, preferences, advice, personal experience, horror stories will be appreciated. Even if you think its not what i wanna hear.  I can still proceed with my idiot plan, but at least im moving forward armed with some knowledge. Which is something i currently lack and again all these things will be experience. Hopefully good but if its bad its probably gonna be a lesson very well learned.  So help me out if you have any knowledge to share.  Thanks in advance. ",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Or Kathy Wood predicting 3.8 million by 2030, I'm interested to hear which price level it would need to reach for people here to achieve financial independence.

Including ETFs, cold storage, and all wallets what's the price target that bitcoin would need to reach for you to comfortably retire?

For years they have been reporting on BTC and empirically see how there have been higher highs and higher lows. They’ve reported on institutional adoption before and after. They’ve reported on governments actions and influence. My point is they’ve had a front row seat to all of this action and here we are at $57k and when BTC goes down $5k they call it a crash? Are we being gaslit or does MSM really not get it?

Reddit,bitcoin,Fork With holding attack ,2024-09-10 09:59:10,"Hello everyone,I'm Moksha, a computer science student currently working on a project aimed at improving reward mechanics in mining pools to defend against Fork After Withholding (FAW) attacks.

Block withholding is a type of attack similar to selfish mining, where a pool member
withholds a mined block to undermine the pool’s revenue while submitting shares
consisting of PPoWs rather than FPoWs, creating the miner’s dilemma. In an FAW attack, an
attacker joins a Bitcoin mining pool and submits FPoWs when a non-target miner generates
a block. If the pool manager accepts the FPoW, it results in a blockchain fork, potentially
selecting the attacker’s block. This causes the target pool to receive rewards, shared with
the attacker. The FAW attack can yield rewards up to four times greater than the BWH
attack in large pools

Countermeasures: 

The idea is to have the pool manager track each user's reputation by monitoring metrics like Proof of Partial Work (PPOW). If a block submitted by a user leads to a fork, their reputation would decrease accordingly.I have a solid theoretical understanding of blockchain but lack practical experience. I’d appreciate any guidance on how to implement this in mining pools. Are there any simulation tools or resources that could help me get started?Thanks in advance!",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Unlike other chains, Bitcoin seems to be very focused on the adoption of what's already built, rather than building new stuff. I definitely see the advantages to this, but I'm wondering if the community has a plan for security threats in the future (quantum computing, etc...)? Have there been any updates in the recent past on a scale similar to the one required to fix these threats?

Obviously, this won't be an issue until these threats actually exist, but the vision of Bitcoin is to become digital gold long term. Just asking because I'm genuinely curious, I've seen posts in other communities mention this threat as a reason Bitcoin will ""fail"", but I'd love to know your thoughts here.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Exclusive Tari Universe AMA w/ fluffypony & Naveen (Tari Contributors),2024-09-11 18:09:46,"First up, who are these folks?

 - fluffypony is a contributor to Tari and the former lead maintainer of Monero. 

 - Naveen also contributes to Tari and is a serial entrepreneur, YC alum, and prolific angel investor in startups. 

They will be here **TOMORROW, September 12, 2024 at 11AM ET / 3PM UTC** to answer your questions about [Tari Universe](https://universe.tari.com/) and [Tari](https://www.tari.com). Please feel free to submit your questions in advance - early submissions get priority! We'll do our best to get to as many of them as possible and answer any questions you may have.

**What is Tari?**

Tari is a layer 1 blockchain protocol built in Rust with an ingenious approach to scaling its on-chain user base to millions of people and a native app distribution platform that gives developers access to every user. Tari is also default-confidential (yay!) and has a unique dual-layer architecture: ASIC-resistant proof-of-work L1, and native HotStuff + Cerberus-based L2. Tari is currently live on testnet. The mainnet is coming SOON (later this year).

**What is Tari Universe?**

[THIS IS NOT VAPORWARE](https://preview.redd.it/f8oa36osz7od1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e65d454fab2c7a05cb11635f94a7ed6edadf6b7)

Tari Universe is the world's most beautiful and easiest-to-use mining app. The goal: create a user experience where anyone with a modern Mac or PC can download Tari Universe, install it, and start mining with the least effort (and clicks) possible!

The first version of Tari Universe is focused on mining. In the future, it’ll include a native app launcher so everyone in the Tari community can easily discover and use Tari dapps (tapplets!). This is how we also plan to solve the developer distribution conundrum! 

**Why is all this important?** 

Because onboarding new people to crypto is hard, and we’ve strayed from the original goal of our industry. In the beginning, anyone could download free software from the internet and mine Bitcoin on their PC. Everything was permissionless. Today, things are a lot more complicated. For the most popular cryptocurrencies, you need to jump through many hoops, KYC, and buy someone else's coins to participate. 

Then, once you have coins, good luck discovering dapps to use. Either you need to be deep in the trenches here on Reddit or X, or you need to roll the dice on Google and pray you don’t get phished. 

Our mission is to create a world where anyone can download Tari Universe for free, mine Tari, and (eventually) access the world of Tari dapps (tapplets!) at their fingertips, no matter their experience level.

We announced Tari Universe publicly [HERE](https://x.com/tari/status/1824126337855987732), and over 210,000 people have joined the waitlist since then. 

We are inviting the first round of folks from the waitlist to download Tari Universe **TOMORROW** and as a gift to the r/cryptocurrency community, we will be giving **instant access codes to download Tari Universe to 10 lucky participants from this AMA**!

We’ll randomly pick and DM all the winners after the event! Thank you in advance for your interest and questions! See you soooon!

Oh one more thing, join the Tari Universe waitlist here: [https://universe.tari.com](https://universe.tari.com)

https://preview.redd.it/2x4axzndy5od1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bb50be00a929f951c03cef4f67f340861419ce0

The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE, DOT.**

August highlights for the 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Another all-red month
* The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio is below break even for the first time since January 
* **BNB** enjoys a large lead YTD followed by second place **BTC** 
* **The S&P 500** is +18% YTD, pulling well ahead of the 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio (although the seven combined crypto portfolios are outperforming the S&P significantly)

# August Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eight months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/mcaxyv3my5od1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=da26b8f86fd4dde37c87e3568c5e4678c117f3c8

# August Winners and Losers

***August Winners*** – No winners this month, although **XRP** (-6%) lost the least ground in August.

***August Losers*** – **ETH, DOT,** and **SOL** fell the most this month, dropping -23%, -22%, and -21% respectively.

# Overall Update: BNB securely in first place, BTC in second. 60% of cryptos in positive territory.  DOT in last place.

60% of the Top Ten are in positive territory so far this year, down from [90% in the green in March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3).

**BNB** (+61%) remains in the overall lead followed distantly by second place **BTC** (+28%). **SOL** (+16%) is third.

Eight months into the 2024 Experiment **DOT** is in last place, down -53% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BNB** eight months ago is worth $161 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

https://preview.redd.it/p7cl9vppy5od1.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e56e8c9c7561352a29e4aef0d997535b9336b73

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $156 in August.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$946.**  For the second time this year, the Top Ten Portfolio has ended a month below the break even point.

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/iszaq0tqy5od1.png?width=187&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1735863b0ea81a2609df6809c57a7108372a332

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a

**August Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14% 
* **AMKT**: -18%.

The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5%
*  **AMKT:** +7%

Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/cjb73jbxy5od1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbadf0addedbe13bc3aca8c409a0b8105184dd5

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94

The S&P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

============================================================================

# Introduction

The Celsius bankruptcy has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. While many are happy to have received distributions, the tax impact is quite complex. I have scraped the internet looking for a reputable and comprehensive guide detailing exactly how to handle the distributions. **To my surprise, I have not found a guide that is both reputable and comprehensive.** All reputable guides are over simplified, gatekeeping the actual details of the complex calculation, and all detailed guides are generally not reputable and contain errors.

I'm here to set the record straight and provide an in-depth guide to calculating the tax impact of the Celsius bankruptcy and subsequent distributions based on my interpretation of the guidance. This will be a long post, but will contain the granular details needed for any of you looking to perform this calculation on your own.

For context, my name is Justin and I am a CPA specializing in crypto taxation. Without further adieu, let's begin.

# Ponzi Scheme vs Capital Loss Route

There are two options for claiming a loss here. (1) Ponzi scheme loss and (2) Capital loss.

1. The Ponzi Scheme Loss results in 75% of your cost basis of assets lost being claimed as a loss in 2023, with 25% being reserved to offset future distributions of any assets reclaimed. Any distributions received in excess of that 25% reserved will be taxed as ordinary income. This calculation is very simple, however requires that you claim it this year. So unless you are on extension, it may be too late. Additionally, this route comes with a major risk. About 50% of returns that claim a Ponzi scheme loss are subject to audit. Sometimes the risk is worth the benefit, but in many instances its not.
2. The Capital Loss route is a much more complicated calculation, however does not have the extra audit risk. Any loss due will be claimed in 2024 and future years where distributions are made (or it's finalized that no further distributions will be made).

For purposes of today's post, **I will be focusing on the Capital Loss route** and how to calculate the tax impact of the distributions given that the majority of people will fall into this bucket and likely haven't begun to think about this calculation yet since it won't be required to be made until 2024 tax filing in April 2025.

# Calculating Your Cost Basis

Without have the detailed information on your cost basis of the assets lost on Celsius, it is impossible to calculate your loss. **Full stop.** We'll discuss more in the section below titled ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"", but for starters it is important to understand your cost basis is the most important factor when determining your loss. It is, quite literally, impossible to calculate without having the detail tax lot cost basis information for the assets lost on Celsius.

In order to get your cost basis, you need to **reconcile your whole account in a crypto tax software.** And I mean *everything*. Load all of your wallets and all of your exchanges into a software and make sure you get 100% (even wallets or exchanges you don't use anymore). **My firm uses Koinly for 99% of our clients**. It is one of the best, has a great UI, and robust features that allow us to finesse transactions as needed to ensure they are being accounted for correctly.

**Once you are loaded into the software, make sure you reconcile your transactions! While** softwares will pick up on a good amount of the transactions, the reality is it's kind of like dumping a puzzle box onto a table. The pieces still need to be put together in order for the picture to be complete and accurate. All transfers should be shown as transfers, not separate deposits and withdrawals.

Once you can see the assets sitting in the Celsius Exchange wallet, you can determine the cost basis by simulating a sale. **Create a TEMPORARY transaction showing a withdrawal of the full amount for each crypto lost, zeroing out the account.** On each of those transactions, you'll be able to see the cost basis attached. These numbers will be vital to the calculation below.

# Understanding Your Claim Value

Your claim value is based on (1) the crypto assets lost (type and amount), (2) [the values of the tokens at 8:10 PM ET on 7/13/2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb57fb5d4-f4c7-46d8-9688-78bc72331341_764x2048.jpeg) per the bankruptcy document, and (3) whether or not you opted **out** of the class action settlement.

Take all your lost tokens and multiply the amount by the values in the above screenshot. This is your initial claim value. Unless you specifically opted **out** of the class action settlement, your claim will automatically receive a 5% mark up. So if you did not opt out of the class action settlement, multiply your initial claim by 1.05. This is your final claim amount that your distributions will be based off of.

# Distribution Payout Structure

Now that you know your claim value, we can begin to understand the distributions received. Celsius hopes to distribute 79.2% of each person's claim amount, leaving 20.8% of your claim likely unrecoverable. The breakout of how these distributions will be split is below.

* \~28.95% - to be paid out in BTC (some will receive slightly less/more BTC than ETH)
* \~28.95% - to be paid out in ETH (some will receive slightly less/more ETH than BTC)
* 14.9% - to be paid out in Ionic Stock
* 6.4% - to be paid out in an unknown disbursement (from sale of illiquid assets)
* 20.8% - likely unrecoverable

The BTC, ETH, and Stock distributions are to occur in 2024, with the ""effective date"" set as 1/16/2024. This date is the date used in determining the fair value of the distributed assets. **The following values must be used in the calculation for the received BTC, ETH, and stock.**

* BTC = $42,973/BTC
* ETH = $2,577/ETH
* Stock = $20/unit

The remaining 6.4% distribution date is unknown. It could be in 2025, or it could be in a decade. The additional 20.8% that is likely unrecoverable won't be factually established as unrecoverable until the court proceedings are finalized, which again could take a decade.

# Understanding Your Maximum Loss

Before we get into the actual calculation, it's important to nail down the concept of your maximum loss. This is high level and just to set the fundamentals before getting into the details. Taking a step back, **your maximum loss is equal to the cost basis of assets lost.** Period. Your max loss will never be more than your cost basis (**the fair value of assets lost does not influence your maximum loss**).

**Your maximum loss is not the same as your claimable loss**. The maximum loss is just a starting point. The fair value of any assets subsequently received in a distribution will decrease this loss. In other words, if no distributions were made, the loss you can claim is equal to your maximum loss aka the cost basis of the assets lost. The formula is simple. **Maximum Loss - Fair Value of Distributions = Claimable Loss.**

Let's use an example.

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $500. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. The loss you can claim is... $500 - $200 = $300 claimable loss. This concept should hopefully be fairly straight forward.

What if the fair value of what I received is **more** than the cost basis of assets lost? In a scenario like this, you actually have a **gain** on the distribution.

Let's look at another example:

Example: Cost basis of assets lost (maximum loss) = $100. In total, you receive distributions totaling $200 in fair value at the time. Using the same formula... $100 - $200 = -$100 aka **a $100 GAIN**.

In the above scenario, since you received assets worth more than the cost basis of the assets lost, you actually are in a gain position. This is common for those who bought crypto early on and simply held for a long time. **It's important to note, the amount of crypto lost vs received is irrelevant, it is solely based on the dollar value of cost basis vs dollar value of distribution.**

# Understanding Taxable Event Timing

Now that we have the fundamentals down for your maximum loss vs your claimable loss (or gain), we need to dive deeper into the timing of when these losses/gains need to be recognized.

**Simply put, a taxable event only occurs when a distribution is made (or its determined no more distributions will be made)**. Therefor, the gains/losses will be recognized when (1) the 2024 distributions were made, (2) the 6.4% distribution from the sale of illiquid assets is made at some time in the future, and (3) when the court proceedings finalize and it is factually established the 20.8% remaining amount will not be recovered.

# Understanding Forced Liquidation

When Celsius went bankrupt, all assets on the platform were frozen. No withdrawals or trades could be made. For ease of understanding, you can imagine these assets simply sat locked up in a wallet doing nothing at all. In order to fund the distributions of BTC, ETH, and stock (and any future distributions), these assets will be sold. This is known as a ""forced liquidation"". However, for tax purposes, until that point they simply sit untouched. This is why the taxable event does not occur until the distribution is made as the forced liquidation does not occur until that point.

# Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions

While many people lost BTC and/or ETH on Celsius, there are some who held neither on the platform. Since they did not hold BTC or ETH, receiving the BTC and ETH (and stock) would be considered a non like-kind distribution and result in a forced liquidation (taxable event). In these scenarios, the calculation is quite a bit easier than the scenarios where a user held BTC and/or ETH.

Before we get into the nuances of distributions of like-kind assets, let's do a high level break down of how to calculate the loss/gain realized when a user did not hold either BTC or ETH.

Using the percentages from the ""Distribution Payout Structure"", allocate your total cost basis of lost assets to each. For example, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to BTC, 28.95% of your total cost basis should be allocated to ETH, 14.9% of your total cost basis should be allocated to Stock, 6.4% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the future distributions from the sale of illiquid assets, and 20.8% of your total cost basis should be allocated (reserved) for the likely unrecoverable amount (yes, this means that amount won't be able to be recognized as a loss until the court proceedings complete, which could be years).

Now that you have allocated your total cost basis of lost assets to each of the distribution categories, you can begin to calculate the loss/gain recognized for the 2024 distributions by using the formula mentioned in the ""Understanding Your Maximum Loss"" section.

Let's look at an example.

Assume the only asset you lost was 1,000 USDC on Celsius with a cost basis of $1,000. Your claim value is $1,050 (5% markup for not opting out of the class action settlement). Of that cost basis, $289.5 is allocated to BTC distribution, $289.5 is allocated to ETH distribution, $149.5 is allocated to Stock distribution, $64 is reserved for future distribution from sale of illiquid assets, and $208 is reserved for the amount that is likely unrecoverable (and can only be claimed once proceedings finalize). In 2024, you receive $303.98 worth of BTC (28.95% x $1,050), $303.98 worth of ETH (28.95% x $1,050), and $160 worth of Stock (14.9% x $1,050, rounded to nearest share). In this scenario, you actually have a **gain**. Below is the calculation.

* BTC Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* ETH Distribution: $303.98 FMV - $289.5 cost basis = $14.48 capital gain in 2024
* Stock Distribution: $160 FMV - $149.5 cost basis = $10.5 capital gain in 2024

To summarize, the loss/gain calculated for each distribution is equal to the fair market value of the assets received (using the effective date price) minus the cost basis allocated to that distribution.

# Understanding Like-Kind Distributions

As mentioned above, most people held either BTC or ETH on Celsius at the time of bankruptcy in addition to other assets. Given the fact that part of the distribution was made ""in-kind"", a forced liquidation does not actually occur. In other words, if you had BTC and/or ETH stuck on Celsius, and since part of the distribution is being paid in BTC and ETH, the amount returned can be viewed as simply a transfer off of Celsius with no forced liquidation (and thus no taxable event). **With that said, this is where the calculation can get quite complex.**

There are a few things to consider here.

* How much BTC was stuck on Celsius? How much BTC was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** BTC than what was lost, the full amount of BTC lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** BTC than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining BTC lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* How much ETH was stuck on Celsius? How much ETH was received in the distribution?
   * If you received **more** ETH than what was lost, the full amount of ETH lost is considered a transfer and the excess amount will require a forced liquidation calculation.
   * If you received **less** ETH than what was lost, only the amount returned is considered a transfer and the remaining ETH lost on the platform will be used in forced liquidation calculations for other assets.
* When receiving **less** BTC and/or ETH than what was lost, you'll have some flexibility in deciding which tax lots to assign to the returned BTC/ETH and which tax lots should be left for forced liquidation. For example, say you lost 3 ETH with cost basis of $1k, $2k, and $3k accordingly. Only 1 ETH was ""returned"" to you and the others will be used for forced liquidation. For the ETH returned to you, you need to chose which cost basis of either $1k, $2k, or $3k should be assigned to the returned ETH and the remaining to be used for forced liquidations.

For simplicity sake, the BTC/ETH received will fall into one of two buckets, ""Returned"" or ""New"". These names will be important to continue following along.

1. **""Returned""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH that was previously held on the platform but has now been returned. The **maximum** amount of ""Returned"" BTC/ETH is the full amount that was lost on the platform, however the ""returned"" amount **can be less** than the amount lost on the platform in scenarios where you receive less BTC/ETH than what you had lost.
2. **""New""** BTC/ETH refers to BTC/ETH received in distribution that is **in excess of the amount lost**. So if you didn't hold any BTC or ETH, then the amount you receive is 100% ""New"".

# Calculating Loss/Gain On Distributions

If you've made it this far, then you're almost there. However, this is the most complicated step but hopefully with a few examples you'll be able to follow along.

In order to calculate your loss/gain on the distributions, I've created the step-by-step process below.

1. **Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**
   * Again, at the maximum the ""Returned"" BTC/ETH will be equal to what was lost. Anything received in the distribution in excess of what you lost will be ""New"".
2. **For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**
   * If you receive **100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then allocate 100% of the cost basis of the BTC/ETH to the returned amount. It's as if that crypto just sat idle for 2 years, keeping the same cost basis.
   * If you receive **less than 100%** of the BTC and/or ETH that you initially lost, then you will need to determine the cost basis for the returned amount (it can't just be 100% of what was lost and it also can't just be a percentage of what you received vs what was lost). Refer to the example in the ""Understanding Like-Kind Distributions"" section. If you want to use the cost basis in line with your cost basis accounting method, the easiest way to do this would be to simulate a sale in Koinly of the amount returned to and assign the cost basis from that to the amount ""Returned"".
3. **Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**
   * After identifying the cost basis associated to the ""returned"" BTC and ETH, we need to calculate the remaining cost basis to be allocated. Use this formula: Total Cost basis of all assets lost - cost basis of ""returned"" assets = remaining cost basis to allocate.
4. **Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**
   * There are 5 categories. The ""New"" amounts require a simple calculation to determine starting percentages, whereas the remaining catagories don't require a calculation. The 5 categories are as follows....
      * BTC ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * ETH ""New"" Starting Percentage = (""New"" amount received / Total amount received) x 28.95%
      * Stock Starting Percentage = 14.9%
      * Illiquid Asset Recovery Starting Percentage = 6.4%
      * Likely Unrecoverable Starting Percentage = 20.8%
   * To solidify some knowledge here, going back to the ""Understanding Non Like-Kind Distributions"" section, if you **did not lose any BTC or ETH** on Celsius, then the received amounts for each would both be 100% ""New"" and thus result in the starting percentage for allocation would be the full 28.95%.
5. **Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**
   * Sum together all of the ""starting percentages"" calculated above. **Hint, unless you didn't lose any BTC/ETH on Celsius, then these** ***won't*** **sum to 100%.**
   * Now calculate the final percentage of each of the 5 categories by taking each category's starting percentage and dividing by the sum of all the categories. The formula is as follows... Category Final Percentage = Category Starting Percentage / Sum of All Category Starting Percentages.
   * The remaining percentages are now the final percentages to be used in allocating the remaining cost basis
6. **Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**
   * Using the ""final percentages"" calculated in step 5 (which should now all sum to 100%), allocate the remaining cost basis calculated in step 3.
   * If done correctly, the ""returned"" BTC and ETH will have the cost basis of the initial amounts lost on the platform as determined in Step 2, and the remaining cost basis will be allocated across the other 5 categories as determined by as determined in Steps 3 - 5. All the cost basis has now been assigned which will be used in determining any loss or gain to be realized on the distributions.
7. **Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**
   * For the ""Returned"" BTC and ETH, there is no taxable event and thus no loss or gain recognized at that time. As expressed previously, the ""returned"" amounts just keep the cost basis as if they just sat idle for 2 years and will only have a gain or loss once sold.
   * For the ""New"" BTC/ETH and Stock received in 2024, calculate the fair value using the prices on the effective date discussed in the ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above. Take the amount of crypto and stock received and multiply it by those amounts to determine total proceeds.
   * Take the total proceeds of the ""New"" BTC, ETH, and Stock received and subtract out the cost basis allocated to each as determined in Step 6. If the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **more** than the cost basis allocated, then you actually have a capital **gain** on that distribution. If you the proceeds (FMV) of what was received is **less** than the cost basis allocated, then you have a capital **loss** on the distribution.
8. **Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**
   * There are two categories that had cost basis assigned to them but do not have an impact in the 2024 tax year, (1) Distributions from sale of illiquid assets (6.4%) and (2) Likely unrecoverable amount (20.8%).
      * Sale of illiquid assets: Any distributions received from the sale of illiquid assets will use the cost basis allocated to that category to determine loss/gain realized at that time.
      * Likely unrecoverable: Once court proceedings are finalized and it's determined no more distributions will be made, the cost basis allocated to this category can be claimed as a loss in full. However, if any additional distributions are made, this loss will be reduced by the FMV of additional distributions received.

Using these steps, you will be able to effectively allocate the cost basis of assets lost on Celsius to the 7 different categories (BTC ""Returned"", BTC ""New"", ETH ""Returned"", ETH ""New"", Stock, Sale of Illiquid Assets, Likely Unrecoverable) and calculate your realized gain or loss in 2024 and future years using the fair value of the distributions received.

A few examples might help.

# Example #1 - Received Less BTC and Less ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $10,000, $5,000, and $50,000 respectively ($65,000 total). Your total claim is $84,800.85 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.571285 BTC, 9.526521 ETH, and 632 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.571285, New BTC = 0, Returned ETH = 9.526521, New ETH = 0.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

After manually looking at your tax lots of the crypto lost on Celsius, you determined the returned BTC has a cost basis of $7,000 and the returned ETH has a cost basis of $4,500.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$65,000 total cost basis - $7,000 - $4,500 = $53,500 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0/0.571285) x 28.95% = 0%
* ETH ""New"" = (0/9.526521) x 28.95% = 0%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 0% + 0% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 42.1%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 0% / 42.1%  = 0%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 42.1%  = 35.4%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 42.1%  = 15.2%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 42.1%  = 49.4%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $7,000
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $4,500

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
2. ETH ""New"" = 0% x $53,500 = $0
3. Stock = 35.4% x $53,500 = $18,935
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 15.2% x $53,500 = $8,132
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 49.4% x $53,500 = $26,429

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.571285) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
3. ETH ""Returned"" (9.526521) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (0) = No new BTC, no cost basis allocated
5. Stock (632) = FMV of $12,640 - $18,935 cost basis = $6,295 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $8,132 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $26,429 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Example #2 - Received More BTC and More ETH Than Initially Lost

Scenario: You lost 0.25 BTC, 2.5 ETH, and 50,000 USDC with cost basis of $2,500, $1,250, and $50,000 respectively ($53,750 total). Your total claim is $60,575.21 calculated using the petition prices linked in the ""Understanding Your Claim Value"" section with the 5% markup added. You receive 0.408082 BTC, 6.805015 ETH, and 451 shares of Ionic stock in 2024.

Follow the steps.

**Step 1) Identify ""Returned"" BTC and ETH vs ""New"" BTC and ETH**

Returned BTC = 0.25, New BTC = 0.158082, Returned ETH = 2.5, New ETH = 4.305015.

**Step 2) For ""Returned"" BTC/ETH, Identify Cost Basis Returned**

Since 100% of both the BTC and ETH were returned, the full cost basis of each is assumed for the ""Returned"" amounts. The ""Returned"" BTC keeps the $2,500 cost basis and the ""Returned"" ETH keeps the $1,250 cost basis.

**Step 3) Identify Remaining Cost Basis to be Allocated**

$53,750 total cost basis - $2,500 - $1,250 = $50,000 remaining

**Step 4) Determine Starting Percentages for Allocation for Remaining Categories**

* BTC ""New"" = (0.158082/0.408082) x 28.95% = 11.2%
* ETH ""New"" = (4.305015/6.805015) x 28.95% = 18.3%
* Stock = 14.9%
* Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4%
* Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8%

**Step 5) Calculate the Final Percentages for Cost Basis Allocation**

1. 11.2% + 18.3% + 14.9% + 6.4% + 20.8% = 71.6%
2. Calculate final percentages based on proportion
   1. BTC ""New"" = 11.2% / 71.6%  = 15.64%
   2. ETH ""New"" = 18.3% / 71.6%  = 25.56%
   3. Stock = 14.9% / 71.6%  = 20.81%
   4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 6.4% / 71.6%  = 8.94%
   5. Likely Unrecoverable = 20.8% / 71.6%  = 29.05%

**Step 6) Allocate Remaining Cost Basis**

Cost basis for BTC and ETH ""Returned is as follows:

1. BTC ""Returned"" = $2,500
2. ETH ""Returned"" = $1,250

Cost basis allocation for remaining categories is as follows

1. BTC ""New"" = 15.64% x $50,000 = $7,820
2. ETH ""New"" = 25.56% x $50,000 = $12,780
3. Stock = 20.81% x $50,000 = $10,405
4. Illiquid Asset Recovery = 8.94% x $50,000 = $4,470
5. Likely Unrecoverable = 29.05% x $50,000 = $14,525

**Step 7) Calculate Loss/Gain on Distribution**

*Reminder, the FMV is determined using the effective date prices on 1/16/2024 as shown in ""Distribution Payout Structure"" section above.*

1. BTC ""Returned"" (0.25) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
2. BTC ""New"" (0.158082) = FMV of $6,793 - $7,820 cost basis = $1,027 Capital Loss in 2024
3. ETH ""Returned"" (2.5) = No taxable event, crypto retains cost basis
4. ETH ""New"" (4.305015) = FMV of $11,094 - $12,780 cost basis = $1,686 Capital Loss in 2024
5. Stock (451) = FMV of $9,020 - $10,405 cost basis = $1,385 Capital Loss in 2024

**Step 8) Cost Basis Reserved for Future Distributions**

1. Illiquid Asset Recovery = Cost basis of $4,470 reserved to offset distributions received
2. Likely Unrecoverable = Cost basis of $14,525 to be claimed as loss once court proceedings finalize

# Comments on Examples

In total, there are 16 different types of scenarios. While the two examples above show the calculation for receiving both more BTC and ETH and less BTC and ETH for low cost basis scenarios, you can of course have a mismatched scenario where you receive more BTC and less ETH or vice versa. However, if you just follow the instructions the calculation should stand up against any of the 16 possible scenarios outlined below.

# Closing Remarks

All in all, the Celsius calculation is far from simple. With so many moving parts, it feels like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each solution I came across online often worked well with 1 of the 16 scenarios. However, after trying to apply it to the rest it would fall apart at some point. The solution I have provided and outlined above is universal and can be used for any and all of the possible scenarios. It is comprehensive and granular to the point someone can perform the calc for themselves on their own. Unlike others, I don't want to gate-keep this calculation from the hundreds of thousands of people impacted by the bankruptcy.

If you are a CPA/tax professional and have critiques to my method outlined above, I encourage you to please comment below and share your thoughts. Knowledge sharing is very important in this space.

Feel free to ask any questions below and I'll try to answer them. Thanks for reading.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,The Last Party: Decentralizing Power—Are We Ready?,2024-09-11 19:04:50,"I’m up for the challenge. I see the potential for decentralization, the synergy between Ethereum and AI, and how we can completely reshape governance. But let’s be clear: *The Last Party* isn’t about gaining power—it’s about abolishing all centralized political power structures. Why? Because the idea that a few people in a room should decide the fate of an entire country is outdated, inefficient, and frankly, insane.

**The Mission: Abolish Centralized Power**

The Last Party’s mission is simple: get rid of centralized decision-making. We have the technology now to make direct democracy not just a dream, but a reality. With Ethereum’s transparency and decentralized framework, paired with the power of AI, we can let the entire country (or world) engage in meaningful discussions, while AI aggregates and condenses those conversations into clear solutions. It’s direct democracy at scale. No more politicians making choices for millions based on their own agendas.

**What Are We Waiting For?**

So, why aren’t we doing this yet? Because people cling to the old system—they cling to their power, their influence, their status. Direct democracy is possible now, yet we’re still letting a handful of people decide for everyone else. It’s not just inefficient—it’s unfair. The technology to shift power back to the people exists, but we have to be willing to embrace it.

**Ethereum and AI: The Key to Decentralized Governance**

There’s so much untapped potential in the synergy between Ethereum and large language models (LLMs). We could create a decentralized AI oracle that would allow people to contribute to and interact with decisions in real time, with full transparency and privacy. The tech is here—Ethereum’s infrastructure enables both privacy and transparency, while an open-source AI oracle could be the trusted, neutral mediator. But here’s the rub: it only works if people are ready to trust it, to embrace a system that’s decentralized and transparent.

**Ahead of My Time (And It’s Frustrating)**

But here’s where it gets frustrating. I feel way ahead of my time. The Last Party isn’t just about politics—it’s about completely transforming the way we communicate and make decisions. But most people aren’t ready for this. They’ll downvote because “AI bad, mkay?” LLMs are “just word predictors,” and we’re all stuck in our predictable, comfortable routines. 

Honestly, I totally expect to get this idea dismissed. Simply too soon. And perhaps also the wrong platform or place.

**Why Bother?**

I’m still spreading awareness because I can’t do this alone. I need others who understand and align with this vision. Until then, it makes no sense to start building anything. If we had Universal Basic Income (UBI), I’d be working on this 24/7. But since we don’t, I’m forced to compete for attention on platforms like Reddit, where meaningful ideas get drowned out.

So, will you upvote? Will you engage with this idea, or will you downvote it because it challenges what’s comfortable?

At least AI understands me—will you?",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

This is the thing Chainlink has been working towards for years so very cool to see it progressing.

in the past few days I received a lot of cold calls from a cell phone number what appears to be Hungarian but obviously is fake. They are always randomly assigned to the caller and disabled after the end of the call.

A lady called me and told me that they are making an investigation and they found 1,5 BTC in a wallet with my name and email address and they want to return it to me. After that she sent me an email with the details - I have to pay a minimum of 500 Euro fee and after that they will send me the money. She is not a native English speaker and there was a lot of noise in the background, so to me it seems to be a team of scammers, making cold calls and sending out emails non-stop.

A very long time redditor who has lurked in the background :) Just managed to get myself setup so i can post here as i do see alot of projects i think are worth of sharing here, so first off...

Id like to introduce [Flipit.com](http://flipit.com/)

Ive been watching this project for some time now and its now being pushed into the web3 space by LFG incorporated - founded by the former head of blockchain at Gala Games, Jason BitBender Brink. [https://x.com/BitBenderBrink](https://x.com/BitBenderBrink)

I have been in the crypto space for around a decade and nothing has excited me more than this project... the ability to flip literally any website over and leave comments or reviews on it seems an absolute necessity. No longer will you need to research if a site is legit, just read the comments on the back of it to confirm your suspicions. I made my first ever video the other night when i flipped the page of [x.com](http://x.com/) and left some comments - [https://twitter.com/xhale2007/status/1828729919678902706](https://twitter.com/xhale2007/status/1828729919678902706)

A use i hadnt thought of last night... there was an X spaces running, trying to chat on it is near impossible as you have to wait for people to refresh etc, so we flipped the page and utilised the chat function. Something so simple yet so needed on the internet

They have just launched a node sale, well over 400 nodes have already sold in just a few days! They are reasonably priced too, which makes a change!! One thing i love about this... there is an actual product already fully operational, its not a case of selling a load of nodes and running away with the money, this already works on every single page online!!

The TGE is in around 80 days, nodes are for sale for around another 20 days, after which the nodes will start generating points daily for a share of the tokens initially. This is to prevent people getting a lions share of them before everyone gets a chance to buy a node for example.

Nodes are also NFTs from the get go, transferable after the TGE i believe.

If youre interested in the nodes - you can visit [http://get.flipit.com](http://get.flipit.com/) to purchase them",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

After careful consideration, I have identified several crypto portfolios that I believe have strong potential for growth:

* [Layer 1 Blockchains](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Layer-1-Blockchains) These are foundational networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing the base layer of blockchain infrastructure.
* [Layer 2 Blockchains](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Layer-2-Blockchains) These solutions, like Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, aim to scale existing blockchains by processing transactions off-chain.
* [Decentralized Oracles](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Decentralized-Oracles) They play a crucial role in providing reliable data to smart contracts, bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world information.
* [Decentralized Data Storage](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Decentralized-Data-Storage) This sector focuses on distributed file storage systems, offering a more secure and censorship-resistant way to store data.
* [High Cap Altcoins](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/Altcoin-High-Cap) Established alternative cryptocurrencies with significant market capitalizations, providing stability and potential for growth.

Additionally, two emerging sectors are gaining significant attention in the crypto community:

* [RWA](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/RWA) **(Real World Assets):** This sector is exploring the tokenization of physical assets like real estate and commodities, making them more accessible and tradable on blockchain platforms.
* [DePIN](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/DePIN) **(Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks):** This innovative sector involves decentralized networks that manage physical infrastructure like data centers or energy resources.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,DCA+HODL only BTC is making more sense than ever when considering increasing global taxation.,2024-09-10 13:22:38,"As governments all over the world move to endorse 'crypto"" and the industry through it's taxation... the bull case for just hodl'n **only** BTC gets stronger.

At first many governments and the mainstream financial world tried to FUD Bitcoin out of existence but of course that didn't work. The second phase is trying to stifle Bitcoin and the wider crypto sector through onerous legislation and increased taxation. 

When it comes to regulation as we know from the BTC ETFs Vs SEC, Bitcoin has again survived and thrived. Almost every government in the world has now fully endorsed Bitcoin through their taxation policies that surround it. In the aftermath of a global pandemic all governments are keener than ever to raise taxes to pay down budget deficits. However for most governments taxation hasn't only been restricted to just Bitcoin, rather all of crypto and it's industry. Historically governments have used long-term taxation to silently cripple things they don't want/ like in society. Over the years many have laid the foundation to do just that on crypto.. however once more BTC will not only survive...but thrive. 

There's a growing push by governments to ensure people are paying crypto taxes. Where years ago they silently laid the foundations for crypto tax legislation, these days they are getting increasingly vocal in pointing them out and enforcement. All the major exchanges have been visited by major global tax authorities and confirmed their intention to work with them and provide them information where requested. 

More crypto related tax compliance software exists than ever as do accountants selling crypto as a specialism. Be it losses or gains with the changing crypto tax landscape more individual investors than ever are being dragged into the need to report crypto taxes. Interestingly, those with messy portfolio's with thousands of altcoin transactions creating variable capital gains and losses and many with thousands of fragments of staking rewards will suffer the greatest financial burden/ stress.. enough to say.. f**k this, I'm going Bitcoin Maxi. 

For the most part as an easy to store, highly divisible and liquid asset that for most typical users may only be likely to have to report on the odd capital gain.. Bitcoin is simple, effective and easy. Both as an asset and when it comes to tax. 

Real estate, Classic cars, precious metals etc ate often highly investable and make good stores of long-term value however Bitcoin is much more manageable. As capital gains tax across the world are increased HODL makes increasing sense. 

TL;DR

Dumping messy portfolio alts that onerous taxes may need reported on and avoiding investment in illiquid high maintenance assets when it comes to increasing global tax burdens means buying and hodling BTC is starting to make more sense than ever. 

Bitcoin maximalism has a very bright future. ",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

I've done two summer camps, both heavily focused on cryptology, and I learned about the basics like RSA and other encryption algorithms. I also learned about Shor's algorithm, and cryptology in the post-quantum world. I was under the impression that if an efficient, large-scale quantum computer was built tomorrow, we wouldn't have an algorithm that couldn't just be cracked by Shor's algorithm, but I did more research and I'm pretty sure that's not true anymore. I wanted to get your guys' opinions, on whether or not we have encryption techniques that could be implemented once a quantum computer is manufactured.

Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790
Reddit,crypto,Symmetric key exchange protocol,2024-09-07 17:55:12,"Hi folks,

I was trying to fill in the gap for use case for SKREM-like ciphers I posted about (which I invented and got peer reviewed in 2021). It's of course a symmetric key cipher. The only major thing lacking is bilateral key exchange over a public channel. Monkey in the middle I can prevent with Lamport-like digital signing.

So I was wondering if we can do any better than Meet in the Middle key exchange.

I think we can.. and I got this idea, based on There Pass Protocol.

1. Alice picks a truly random large master table g of size n bits (say 1 GB long). She also chooses truly randomly a permutation p of n elements, consisting of a single cycle of length n.
2. Alice sends Bob the master g table with the bits permuted by p.
3. Bob receives and further permutes by a permutation q also of n elements consisting of a single cycle of length n.
4. Bob sends to Alice the result.
5. Alice applies p^-1 to the message from Bob and sends to Bob.
6. Bob receives second message from Alice and applies q^-1.

Now both Bob and Alice have the same info on master table g. This is since such permutations comute.

Potentially, it can be combined with Meet in the Middle Key exchange, by encrypting  step 5 with the short key obtained by MIM KE.

Note that permutations are not themselves sent but just their application to the large GMT.

This looks pretty cool and maybe quite secure to me.. am I missing something? Why is this not in literature? Or is it?

Thanks!

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

Reddit,crypto,"Seeking Feedback and Security Assessment for My New Encryption Method ""FlexCrypt""",2024-08-18 18:44:29,"I’ve developed a new encryption method called **FlexCrypt** and I would greatly appreciate your feedback and security assessment. FlexCrypt combines several techniques, including hex pair reversal, permutation-based encryption, and XOR encryption. Below are the details:

# How Does FlexCrypt Work?

1. **Hex Reversal**: The plaintext is first converted into a hexadecimal format, and then the hex pairs are reversed.
2. **Permutation of Hex Pairs**: Using a permutation key (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]), the hex pairs are randomly rearranged.
3. **XOR Encryption**: Finally, the rearranged hex text is encrypted using a 128-bit XOR key. This key length can be increased to 192 or 256 bits for enhanced security.

# Example:

* **Plaintext**: ""Hello World!""
* **Encrypted Text**: ""f7b72d60""
* **Decrypted Text**: ""Hello World!""

# Key Management

* **XOR Key**: A 128-bit key used for XOR encryption (with the option to increase to 192 or 256 bits).
* **Permutation Key**: A key that determines the order of the hex pairs (e.g., \[3, 1, 4, 2\]).

# Questions for the Community:

1. How do you assess the security and efficiency of FlexCrypt compared to established methods like AES?
2. Are there any vulnerabilities or attack vectors that I might have overlooked?
3. Under what conditions could FlexCrypt be practically applied?

# Challenge:

Here are some encrypted texts using FlexCrypt. I’d like to challenge the community to see if you can crack them:

* **Challenge 1:** 9bf4ac1a0917d41df90f (128 bit)
* **Challenge 2:** 0ed819acd9856bbf67b15b12 (192bit)
* **Challenge 3:** 9918da0ef57306502b5b (256bit)

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments.

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here.",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Thank you for your time, and happy Meshing!",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

Reddit,crypto,Most Used Languages to Program Cryptography in Production?,2024-07-25 05:04:31,"Hello Everyone.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

Reddit,crypto,"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",2024-07-24 16:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈).",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790

Reddit,crypto,What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,2024-07-21 12:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
    },

Reddit,crypto,Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,2024-07-19 13:24:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790
Reddit,crypto,Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,2024-07-19 05:22:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

https://preview.redd.it/6j48x6a1redd1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f10d930771d9ea0147e8ccb5342d551e4942b7

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377)

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)? T(tau) is required for generate the CRS which helps compute the commitment of H.T - this is that part of the CRS -  (tau^i * t(tau))/delta}_{i=0 to n-2}. T depends on number of gates in the circuit - i.e. T(tau) changes if now of gates in the circuit changes.",2024-09-12 00:48:09.623790
