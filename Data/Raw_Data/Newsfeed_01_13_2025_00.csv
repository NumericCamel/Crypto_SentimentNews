Notably, Bitcoin has been unable to hold substantially above the $100,000 price level since it first broke through in early December, and multiple breakouts have been followed by rejections. The most recent rejection came last week when the price peaked at $102,000 on Monday, only to reverse sharply and fall to $92,000 by Thursday. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead This continued tug-of-war has brought the bearish case for BTC into sharper focus, with technical analysis highlighting a 50/50 chance of a further drop or a bounce. $90,000: A Pivotal Support Zone Under Threat Recent Bitcoin price action has significantly put the $90,000 price point as the most notable support level for the bulls. Although the crypto has largely held above the $90,000 support level even during the recent corrections, the bearish outlook hinges on its ability to defend this level.  According to technical analysis by crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin has made five different attempts to test a support trendline around $90,000, which further reveals the importance of the level. This repeated retest increases the chance of weakening the support strength and is gradually making Bitcoin more vulnerable to a sharp decline.  With this in mind, the major task for Bitcoin bulls would be to hold above the $90,000 and break resistance levels above $100,000 in order to invalidate a bearish outlook. Should Bitcoin fall below $90,000, it could cascade to a further price drop to the $87,000 range or even lower. A fall below $87,000 could, in turn, cause a quick fall through a $12,000 gap to reach $75,000.     Resistance Levels To Break: $103,000 To $108,500 As noted by EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin could continue to pose a bearish threat until it closes above a few resistance levels. These resistance levels are situated at $103,000, $106,400, and $108,500, and consistent daily closes above these thresholds are required to confirm a bullish trend. The third resistance of $108,500 is the most notable, as a break above it would see Bitcoin trading at new all-time highs. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, current technical indicators suggest that the chances of a pump are low at the moment. For instance, Bitcoin has now lost the support of the 21 EMA on the daily candlestick timeframe, and sentiment is now in a neutral zone on the Fear and Greed Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 As it stands, the biggest factor that could see bullish momentum return to Bitcoin is the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th and the anticipated crypto-positive policies that during the new administration. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the event could either trigger a short-term rally or exacerbate the ongoing decline. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin To $350,000? Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction",2025-01-12 21:30:57+00:00,"Jeremie Davinci, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency domain, has garnered attention with his audacious forecast that Bitcoin may attain an extraordinary value of $350,000. This forecast, lately disseminated on social media, is predicated on historical trends and the present dynamics of Bitcoin mining expenses. Related Reading: $7,000 Ethereum In Sight? Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path The current expense for miners to generate one Bitcoin is approximately $70,000. Davinci indicates that historically, under positive market conditions, Bitcoin has frequently surpassed its mining cost by a ratio of five. This association indicates that, if historical trends persist, a price of $350,000 is feasible. The Cost Factor Of Mining The basis of Davinci’s approach is the relationship between mining costs and market price of Bitcoin. The mining process requires electricity and advanced technology among other resources. These costs build the basis for Bitcoin’s value as they rise. Currently spending over $70,000 to extract one BTC, miners may open the path for significant price increases in the future, claims Davinci. It costs miners about $70k to produce 1 #Bitcoin now, less with better hardware or cheap energy. In past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has hit over 5x the mining cost. Huge potential ahead! — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 11, 2025 He underscores that this forecast lacks a defined timescale and instead embodies an optimistic perspective grounded in historical performance. He asserted, “Significant potential lies ahead!” in reference to Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Bitcoin: Institutional Impact And Market Forces Davinci’s prognosis is set against a landscape of growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Prominent corporations have commenced the acquisition of substantial quantities of BTC, indicating assurance in its long-term growth prospects. Companies such as BlackRock and MicroStrategy have made substantial investments in Bitcoin, contributing to the optimistic feeling around the cryptocurrency. In addition, the recent halving event in April 2024 cut the block payment for miners to 3.125 BTC. This made it harder for new coins to enter the market. Around 19.9 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving less than 2 million to be made. This could cause prices to rise as long as people want them. A Prudent Optimism Although Davinci’s projection is undeniably ambitious, it is crucial to regard such forecasts with prudence. The bitcoin market is famously unstable and can undergo significant fluctuations in value. Analysts have observed that although Bitcoin may realize considerable increases over time, it has also had huge corrections in previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead As we approach 2025 and beyond, numerous investors are closely observing how these dynamics will develop. The interplay between mining expenses, institutional acceptance, and market mood will be a major determining factor in ascertaining the feasibility of Davinci’s prediction. Bold predictions like Jeremie Davinci’s are being debated as the crypto market continues to evolve. His forecast of Bitcoin reaching $350,000 reflects both reliance on historical trends and a sense of optimism. Featured image from Reuters, chart from TradingView",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Spot Bitcoin ETFs One Year After US Launch: Here’s How Funds Have Fared So Far,2025-01-12 20:00:19+00:00,"The introduction of Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States marked a historic milestone for the cryptocurrency market. These Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which first went live in the US on January 11, 2024, have had massive success in just one year, making them the greatest ETF launch in history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 As it stands, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now become one of the major drivers of Bitcoin’s price growth and played a huge role in Bitcoin’s break above $100,000. Furthermore, these US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs are now collectively the biggest holders of Bitcoin. Performance Metrics Of US-Based Spot Bitcoin ETFs For years, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resisted the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, making their eventual approval in January 2024 a notable turning point for the crypto industry. Particularly, the SEC approved the first 11 Spot Bitcoin ETF applications on January 10, 2024. All the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated a positive performance in their inaugural year except for Grayscale’s GBTC. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs was met with record-breaking enthusiasm, as these funds registered the highest trading volumes of any ETF launch in history during their first few days of operation. Apart from opening the Bitcoin and crypto industry to traditional investors who would otherwise not invest in cryptocurrencies, many large Bitcoin holders also saw the ETFs as the best way to invest in order to take advantage of their regulatory clarity. Particularly, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund have led the charge with substantial inflows throughout the year. These two funds quickly established themselves as dominant players, with each witnessing over $3 billion in inflows within their first 20 days of trading. At the time of writing, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs now collectively control about $107.64 billion in Bitcoin assets, which represents about 5.75% of the total Bitcoin market cap, according to data from SoSoValue. Since they began trading one year ago, these ETFs have witnessed a cumulative total net inflow of $36.22 billion. In terms of cumulative net inflows, the IBIT has witnessed the highest inflow amount in the tune of $37.67 billion, while FBTC follows behind with $12.16 billion. These two have been enough to balance the $21.57 net outflows from the pre-existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which was converted to a Spot Bitcoin ETF.  Other ETF providers have also witnessed cummulative net inflows in the past year, with ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF also at $2.49 billion and $2.43 billion, respectively, at the time of writing. However, the remaining seven ETF providers have yet to cross the $1 billion threshold in cumulative net inflows, indicating a more uneven distribution of investor interest across the industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead Where Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Go From Here? The only way for Spot Bitcoin ETFs is up, especially on the longer timeframe in 2025 and beyond.

At the same time, the Ethereum market showed similar struggles as the prominent altcoin declined by 10% over the past seven days. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery Ethereum ETFs Net Assets Drop Below $12 Billion Amid Strong Outflows Following a negative performance in the first week of 2025, the Ethereum Spot ETFs are struggling to rediscover their bullish form as another trading week was marred by higher withdrawals than deposits by investors. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the week began on a positive note as the Ethereum ETFs rallied to record $128.72 million in net inflows on January 6. However, this positive momentum was overshadowed by three consecutive days of cumulative net losses of $314.61 million leading to a weekly net outflow of $185.89 million. During the course of this week, Fidelity’s FETH registered the largest net outflows valued at $276.13 million. This figure was followed by minimal withdrawals from Grayscale’s ETHE, ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW estimated to the tune of $16.12 million, $14.60 million and $3.05 million, respectively. BlackRock’s ETHA was the only ETF to see a net inflow totalling $124.11 million while VanEck’s ETHV, Invesco’s QETH, 21Shares’ CETH, and Franklin Templeton’s EZET reported no net flows. Following the Ethereum Spot ETFs underperformance, their total net assets for has declined by 10.89% to $11.61 Billion, representing 2.96% of the Ethereum market cap. Meanwhile, the cumulative total net inflow for these investment funds has now climbed to $2.45 billion. As expected, Grayscale’s ETHE continues to lead the market with net assets totaling $4.57 billion, while BlackRock’s ETHA maintains its dominance with $3.68 billion in net flows since the launch of these Ethereum ETFs in July. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Ethereum Rally To $6,000 Ethereum Crashes By 10% Due To General Market Struggles In other news, data from CoinMarketCap shows the price of Ethereum declined by 10.06% in the past week in line with wide scale losses across the crypto market. Notably, this price loss was accompanied by $1.4 billion in exchange outflows, as many bullish investors looked to accumulate popular altcoin at lower prices. At press time, Ethereum trades at $3,287 following a slight gain of 0.58% in the last 24 hours. During this period, the asset’s trading volume has plummeted by 55.98% and is now valued at $11.75 billion. In making any headway, ETH would need to break past the immediate resistance at $3,350 which may ignite a rally to around $3,700.   Featured image from StormGain, chart from Tradingview",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

While the DeFi token has shown some stability in the last 24 hours, certain market indicators suggest the bearish storm may be far from over. Related Reading: DeFi Exploits Plunge 40% In 2024, But Centralized Exchange Losses Soar – Report AAVE Could Crash By 30% If Signal Holds  In a recent post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a hawkish prediction on the AAVE market. According to Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on the AAVE weekly chart, suggesting a major decline on the horizon. In trading, the TD Sequential developed by Tom DeMark is used to identify potential turning points in price trades. It basically indicates when an asset’s price is overextended in a particular direction and due for a reversal. Based on Martinez’s forecast, if the TD Sequential sell signal holds, AAVE could undergo a significant correction falling to around $264. However, in the presence of overwhelming selling pressure, the L2 token could be headed for $203, indicating a possible 29.5% decline from AAVE’s current price.   Interestingly, this bearish prediction is backed by other indicators. Firstly, Relative Strength Index indicator has a value of 62.57 indicating that AAVE is still far from the oversold zone and may experience further decline in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the asset’s 100-day simple average is also far below the current price which can be interpreted as another bearish signal. Clearly, there’s much need to apply caution in engaging the present market. At press time, AAVE trades at $290.04 after a slight 2.48% gain in the last 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume has dipped by 48.99% which may potentially indicate that selling pressure is beginning to ease up.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,5 Altcoins to Buy Now as Bitcoin Price Hovers at $95K After DOJ Dip,2025-01-12 15:04:31+00:00,"Although Bitcoin’s recent price drop led many to wonder whether this is the end of its euphoria. However, as it’s looking to turn out, all BTC really did was go into healthy consolidation after a big move in December. Technical analysis experts have now presented several BTC charts that all say the worst is over for Bitcoin and, by extension, the overall crypto market. With another potential crypto bull run just around the corner, the time is right for you to invest in the dip. One of the best ways to multiply your investment in crypto is by purchasing high-potential altcoins, such as the ones we’ve handpicked for you after careful research. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Altcoin Presale for First-Time Investors Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a descendant of the insanely popular Pepe meme, but it’s not all fun and games! The purpose of the project is to make profitable crypto investing accessible for everyone by sharing unique trading insights that are usually reserved for Wall Street pros. $WEPE’s community-driven approach ensures that crypto whales can no longer control the market. The token is currently in presale and has collected over $45M so far and it’s well on its way towards $50M. Currently, each $WEPE token is priced at $0.00036646, but it will soon increase as the token is set to enter the next phase of its presale. Speaking of returns, experts are predicting a 10x return under a conservative scenario. Some are even predicting a 500% increase from the current listing price. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Layer-2 Token Promises to Solve Solana’s Limitations Solaxy ($SOLX) is the native currency of the new Layer-2 protocol that Solaxy is building for Solana. For those who don’t know, Solana is a popular blockchain, at par with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This new network will solve all the problems of the previous Layer-1 chains, namely congestion, scalability, and unsuccessful and slow transactions. It’s also worth noting that $SOLX can be used on both ecosystems, which will result in greater liquidity and easier access to DeFi platforms for crypto investors and traders. Speaking of $SOLX’s presale, $9.8M has already been raised. Each token is presently available at $0.001598, and several experts suggest that it has the potential to be the next 100x token. To know more about $SOLX’s uniqueness, check out its whitepaper and X feed. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Proprietary Token of the Best Crypto Wallet Right Now Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of the increasingly popular non-custodial crypto wallet Best Wallet. Holders of $BEST will get a bunch of additional perks on Best Wallet, such as lower transaction fees and better staking rewards. Moreover, you’ll also get early access to new projects and the ability to purchase them at some of the lowest prices ever. After a successful $1M private round, $BEST’s presale has so far raised $6.9M. Each token is priced at $0.023575, but a price hike is coming in just a few hours from now, so get in at the earliest. 4. YourTrump ($YTP) – Benefit from Pro-Crypto Trump’s Popularity YourTrump ($YTP) is a unique crypto project in that the value of the token depends on Donald Trump’s X followers. This one-of-a-kind approach has garnered a lot of attention from investors and influencers alike. Currently, Donald Trump has over 97.2M followers on X. Given that Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance was one of the biggest reasons the entire crypto market soared to new highs, $YTP presents a unique opportunity to benefit from Trump’s popularity among crypto heads. 50% of the total token supply has been allotted to presale, which will last for a total of 60 days, divided into 4 rounds. Each round will have a different bonus rate. For instance, the bonus rate in round 1 was 10%. The rate for the last round will be based on the token’s performance. Each token is currently priced at $0.0284, but prices increase in the next 5 days. It’s also worth noting that $YTP’s estimated listing price, which is at all times mentioned on its official website, has been rapidly increasing. Just a week ago, it was $2.8322, but it’s now $8.8223, so those who purchase $YTP right now can potentially reap mind-boggling returns. 5. Rexas Finance (RXS) – Promises to Transform Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is an interesting project that aims to transform distributed finance (DeFi) and simplify real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. For those who don’t know, RWA is the process of converting real-world tangible things into tokens that can then be traded on blockchains.   Bridging the gap between tangible assets and crypto makes investments in collectibles, commodities, and real estate accessible for everyone. RXS is currently in stage 11 of its presale, currently priced at $0.175 per token. It has already raise $38.8M out of the total $41M. Plus, out of the total presale token supply of 425M, 412M has already been sold. Simply put, the presale is 97% done, so interested buyers should hurry up. Bottom Line With Bitcoin ready to kickstart another rally upwards, potentially reaching new all-time highs, the above-mentioned altcoins present superb investment opportunities. However, none of it is investment advice, plus we always suggest you do your own research before putting your hard-earned money in any asset class, let alone crypto.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Top 3 beste crypto’s om nu in te investeren voor 2025,2025-01-12 14:57:19+00:00,"De cryptomarkt blijft zich in een hoog tempo ontwikkelen en investeerders zijn dan ook continue op zoek naar de meest veelbelovende activa om aan hun portfolio toe te voegen. Nu Bitcoin met zijn schommelingen weer eens bewijst hoe volatiel de cryptomarkt is, hebben wij ChatGPT gevraagd om een top 3 van de beste crypto’s te maken. Het antwoord Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SOL) en Polkadot ($DOT). In dit artikel gaan we deze top drie verder bespreken. Ethereum Ethereum is een van de grootste platformen voor Decentralized Finance (DeFi) en Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT’s), twee snelgroeiende sectoren in de cryptomarkt. Volgens ChatGPT staat Ethereum voor de volgende reden in de top 3. Technologisch gezien blijft het platform zich continue ontwikkelen en de overgang naar Ethereum 2.0 en Proof of Stake (PoS) maakt het netwerk veel efficiënter. Het platform weet tegelijkertijd energie te besparen en is dankzij de overgang veel schaalbaarder. Na Bitcoin blijft Ethereum een van de meest vertrouwde cryptocurrency’s en een stabiele keuze dat zeer geliefd is onder de investeerders in de cryptowereld. De koers van $ETH is sinds oktober 2024 met 28% gestegen en staat nu op een koers van $3250. Solana Hoewel Cardano en Tron bekend staan als alternatieven voor Ethereum, biedt Solana enkele unieke voordelen. Volgens ChatGPT zijn het net deze unieke voordelen die Solana een voorsprong in de top 3 geven op bijvoorbeeld Cardano, die ook een solide basis heeft. Al deze factoren maken van Solana een van de meest veelbelovende en vooruitstrevende blockchains. Met een koers die nu iets beneden de $187 staat, weet Solana het afgelopen jaar, met de nodige schommelingen, toch stabiel te blijven. Polkadot Als derde heeft ChatGPT de Polkadot in de top 3 staan die een niche aanbiedt die andere projecten niet hebben. Het wordt door ChatGPT benoemd als een brug tussen blockchains, vooral omdat het er bekend om staat dat het verschillende blockchains weet te verbinden. Hierdoor kan het platform op een unieke manier gegevens uitwisselen en weet het een oplossing te bieden waar fragmentatie een probleem is. De koers is sinds januari 2024 met meer dan 100% gestegen, waarmee het laat zien dat het door het jaar heen zich staande wist te houden op een volatiele markt. Alternatieve crypto opties voor een divers portfolio Naast de bovenstaande gevestigde cryptocurrency’s zijn er ook andere opties in de cryptowereld die voor de investeerder de moeite waard zijn om te bekijken. Gezien hun potentiële groei zijn meme coins, die zich in de presale fase bevinden, vaak een aantrekkelijke keuze om een crypto portfolio te diversifiëren. Dit is vaak een strategie zet dat veel rendementen kan opleveren. We hebben hieronder drie alternatieve opties op een rij gezet. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) heeft bijvoorbeeld een heel platform opgericht voor de kleine investeerders en positioneert zich als een community gedreven token. Het zorgt ervoor dat het een ‘Wepe Army’ creëert die profiteert van allerlei marktinzichten. Het is een ware hub waar gebruikers strategieën met elkaar kunnen delen en waarmee ze hun kansen kunnen significant kunnen vergroten, net zoals de grote whales op de cryptomarkt altijd doen. Op dit moment is de presale nog bezig en kunnen de $WEPE tokens voor een aantrekkelijker prijs worden aangeschaft. Nu naar Wall street wepe Solaxy Een tweede interessante keuze is Solaxy, een Layer-2 presale token die is gebouwd op het Solana netwerk. Dit project heeft ervoor gezorgd dat het de schaalbaarheid en snelheid van het Solana netwerk weet te verbeteren. Hierdoor wordt ook de kans op storingen en mislukte transacties verminderd. Als er vandaag wordt geïnvesteerd in de $SOLX tokens, krijgen investeerders niet alleen toegang tot een nieuwe blockchain, maar kunnen ze ook genieten van een APY van 359%. Nu naar Solaxy Best Wallet Als laatste is er nog een nieuwe cryptowallet op de markt die binnen een korte periode al heel wat populariteit heeft vergaard. Best Wallet is een nieuwe en innoverende crypto wallet die gefocust is op de gebruikersvriendelijkheid van de moderne crypto investeerder. Alle investeringen zijn op een overzichtelijke manier te zien en er wordt ook een overzicht van veelbelovende presales aangekondigd in de ‘Upcoming Token’ feature. Hiermee krijgen gebruikers van Best Wallet een voorsprong op de brede cryptomarkt. Op dit moment zijn de $BEST token voor een goedkope prijs beschikbaar via officieel website.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Price To $140,000 Or $67,000? Analyst Weighs In On Interesting BTC Setup",2025-01-12 14:00:43+00:00,"After an unexpected bearish plot twist in the past week, the Bitcoin price action has been pretty quiet over the weekend, with BTC barely holding above the $94,000 level. The premier cryptocurrency briefly slipped beneath this price mark on Saturday, January 11, before traveling to as high as $94,870. Interestingly, a top analyst on the social media platform X has put forward an interesting analysis of the Bitcoin price, suggesting that the market leader might be at a pivotal juncture. Could a bullish breakout be on the cards for the price of BTC or is a deep correction the more likely scenario? Bitcoin’s Performance In The Next Few Weeks In a recent post on X, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez weighed in on the trajectory of the Bitcoin price over the next few weeks. According to the market pundit, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently set up such that it could see a move higher to $140,000 or a pullback to around $67,000. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Still On? STH Cost Basis Suggests So These projections are based on the formation of two patterns, namely the head-and-shoulders and the bull pennant, on the BTC 12-hour price chart. The pennant pattern is marked by a price upswing (the flagpole) followed by a consolidation range with converging trend lines (the pennant), while the head-and-shoulders formation (as the name suggests) is characterized by three distinct price highs, including a higher “head” between two lower “shoulders.” The pennant chart formation often serves as a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting the persistence of an upward price trend. The head-and-shoulders pattern, on the other hand, typically indicates a potential bearish reversal, signaling a shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. As seen in the chart above, the Bitcoin price is yet to break beneath the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern, which often serves as confirmation for the trend reversal. If the premier cryptocurrency breaks the neckline situated at around $93,000, its price could plunge to as low as $67,000. However, Martinez pointed out that the next target could be higher if the Bitcoin price holds above the neckline and breaks out of the bull pennant pattern. If this occurs, a bullish surge to around $140,000 could be on the cards for the price of the market leader. This would represent an almost 50% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $94,600, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is down by nearly 4% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back?

Jones, a well-known figure in finance, recently sparked conversations within the cryptocurrency community. Her remarks about the altcoin’s potential price movement have generated significant buzz, drawing attention to the digital asset’s future prospects. In a recent podcast session, she discussed the conjecture over her opinion that XRP might attain a value of $100. She said that certain media outlets misconstrued her comments. Related Reading: $7,000 Ethereum In Sight? Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path Clarifying Misunderstandings Jones explained that she never provided a timeframe for when XRP would hit $100. She urged her audience to concentrate on the overall context of what she was delivering rather than getting sucked into dramatic headlines. Her purpose was to foster discussion about long-term potential within cryptocurrencies such as XRP and not to try to predict their short-term value. Today’s Be Wealthy & Smart podcast: Discover if I said XRP was going to $100 this year (and if I didn’t say it, what I did say).https://t.co/F9BT3vJKmk#BeWealthyandSmartPodcast #podcast #investing #investingpodcast #invest #financial #XRP #Crypto — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) January 10, 2025 Historical Context And Current Value Jones talked about her investment journey in terms of how much $100 worth of XRP could buy. She could buy about 400 units at $0.25 each with the money she put in. Today, she can see that the same amount of money will only buy about 44 XRP, which are worth about $2.20 each. XRPUSD is currently trading at $2.47. Chart: TradingView The Future Of XRP With the current trading price, Jones remains optimistic about the future of XRP. She highlighted that current changes in regulation can create a better environment for cryptocurrencies. Over time, once governments and financial institutions begin to take on digital assets, it will be an upward price trajectory. According to Jones, the more people become knowledgeable and accept cryptocurrencies, assets such as XRP will become critical in the financial world. Related Reading: XRP Scores A Lower High Break On Daily – ATH Next? She also added that, usually, historical trends in the cryptocurrency space often have dramatic price increases right after periods of regulatory clarity and general market acceptance, giving the investors a chance to look beyond immediate price fluctuations and towards the long-term viability of their investment. As the year 2025 progresses and people’s ideas about digital assets change, Jones’s views will continue to shape talks about the future of altcoins. Even though it’s not clear if XRP will be able to reach such high prices, investors and fans will be closely following its progress.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Trump’s inauguratie: gaan bekende crypto’s stijgen of start nieuwe crypto crash?,2025-01-12 11:50:29+00:00,"Volgende week maandag, 20 januari, neemt Donald Trump opnieuw plaats in het Witte Huis. Volgens velen is dit positief voor de crypto markt, maar er wordt ook gespeculeerd over een nieuwe crypto crash op de dag zelf. Dit komt door een groot aantal short-term holders die mogelijk uit paniek verkopen als BTC te ver daalt. Aan de andere kant is de inauguratie van Trump een positieve factor voor de crypto markt. Trump kan als president belangrijke veranderingen maken in het regulatoire klimaat in de VS, maar ook heeft hij mogelijk plannen voor een Bitcoin reserve. Dit kan zorgen voor directe en indirecte koopdruk, die Bitcoin naar een nieuw niveau zou tillen. Dreiging voor nieuwe crypto crash Gebaseerd op de Short-Term Cost Basis is het niveau van $88k (lichtblauw) een belangrijke om te verdedigen. Aan het begin van de middag ligt de Bitcoin koers nog redelijk stabiel op $93.900. Mocht hij onder $88k dalen, dan is het mogelijk dat short-term holders uit paniek verkopen. Zo’n scenario kan leiden tot een domino-effect, waarin de koers steeds lager gaat, doordat meer mensen uit paniek verkopen. Uiteraard wordt de koers uiteindelijk opgevangen door een stijgende koopdruk. Aan de andere kant is een grote crypto rally mogelijk als de Bitcoin koers boven $88k blijft na de inauguratie van Trump op 20 januari. Hoe snel de interesse in crypto vanaf dat moment zal groeien is nog een verrassing, maar het is genoeg om Bitcoin naar een nieuwe all-time high boven $108.300 te tillen. Een ander scenario is dat investeerders en traders in de aanloop naar 20 januari massaal investeren, waardoor bekende crypto’s stijgen vóór de 20e. Als dit gebeurt, blijf dan op de hoede voor een mogelijke ‘sell-the-news’, die op 20 januari of in de opvolgende dagen kan zorgen voor een crypto crash. Gaat Bitcoin dalen naar $88k in crypto crash? Op het moment is het erg onwaarschijnlijk dat de Bitcoin koers onder $88k gaat dalen in de aanloop naar 20 januari. Sinds zijn stijging boven $90k in november 2024, is de bekende cryptomunt nog geen enkele keer onder dit niveau gezakt. Het sterke support rond $90k maakt een daling onder $88k erg lastig op korte termijn. Bitcoin heeft op hetzelfde moment te maken met een sterke resistance rond $97.300, gevormd door zijn 30-daagse moving average (geel). Een andere sterke resistance is te zien rond $102k. Deze resistance zorgde vorige week maandag voor een significante daling. Ook de Relative Strength Index (RSI) van 45 maakt een scherpe daling onwaarschijnlijk. De RSI geeft aan dat het momentum neutraal is met een lichte bearish tint, dit betekent dat BTC niet wordt beschouwd als overgewaardeerd op het moment. Tenzij het sentiment van de markt bearish wordt, lijkt het erop dat crypto gaat stijgen. Combineer dit met de mogelijkheid dat de markt zeer positief reageert op de inauguratie van Trump en de komende weken kunnen zeer winstgevend worden voor investeerders. Cryptocurrency is riskant, maar om de komende weken geen crypto te hebben, is in zekere zin ook riskant. Mogelijk zorgt Trump voor een grote rally zonder crash en zien we de levels van vandaag voorlopig niet meer terug. Welke altcoins gaan stijgen in volgende crypto rally? Bitcoin en grote altcoins kunnen de komende weken veel aandacht krijgen en significant stijgen. Als we echter kijken naar kleinere altcoins, kunnen deze nog harder stijgen als ze worden opgepakt door investeerders. Hieronder kijken we naar 3 kleine crypto’s met potentie om te exploderen in het eerste kwartaal van 2025. Kleine altcoins dragen uiteraard meer risico dan Bitcoin en bekende crypto’s, maar kunnen hierdoor ook veel harder stijgen als alles goed gaat. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is een van de meest populaire crypto presales van het moment en heeft al $46,5 miljoen opgehaald sinds zijn lancering in december. Het voordeel van $WEPE is dat deze meme coin meer waard kan worden. Daarnaast heeft $WEPE utility voor token holders. $WEPE geeft je toegang tot een exclusieve community met traders van verschillende niveaus, maar ook elite trading inzichten die iedereen binnen de community kan gebruiken. Deze trading inzichten kunnen investeerders helpen nog meer geld te verdienen tijdens de bull run. The hottest trend this season?

Een ander voordeel is dat je je tokens direct kunt staken voor een huidige APY van 27%. De hoge populariteit van de presale is een goed teken dat de meme coin kan exploderen na lancering. Nu naar Wall Street Pepe Solaxy ($SOLX) Solana is behoorlijk gegroeid sinds 2023 en kan ook in 2025 nog groter worden dan ooit tevoren. Solaxy ($SOLX) is van plan om Solana naar een nieuw niveau te tillen, door de allereerste Solana Layer-2 blockchain te lanceren. De presale van Solaxy heeft tot zover meer dan $9,8 miljoen opgehaald. $SOLX kan gebruikt worden binnen de nieuwe blockchain, bijvoorbeeld voor het traden van coins op het netwerk en wellicht om extra geld te verdienen met DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Het voordeel van Solaxy is dat je kunt genieten van Solana’s snelheden en lage kosten, zonder de kans op storingen en gefaalde transacties. $SOLX is vandaag nog te koop voor $0,001598 per token, maar stijgt morgen verder in prijs. Solaxy biedt momenteel nog aantrekkelijke staking beloningen met een APY van 354%, zodat je extra tokens kunt claimen na het einde van de presale.

Reddit,solana,winning a memecoin is like winning PvP speed gambling,2025-01-12 11:00:23,"most memecoin is scam, they launch then they rug.

a coin launch in pumpfun then graduate to Raydium and all sell all and dev rug and run.

even a KOL can not know which is a winning memecoin. 
I know a KOL buy $4000 of a memecoin then sell all after 1 day, now after 60 days it value 1.5M dollar with MC 200M, and he rebuy at this price.

i track list of KOL on gmgn.ai and see them all buy and sell immediately after few minutes, to get 50-200% profit and can lost 99% investment in few minutes.

Know that to evaluate your risk, dont be get farmed by them.
it gamble game, no value at all. Who run last will lost all money. 

I used bot copy trade and with large volatile even slippage 30% cant sell at that time , bot keep failing. And then I lost all money with that coin. 

Yes there alway a wining memecoin there with potential x1000 even x10,000, but with 50.000 memecoin launching a day , ~ 2M coin a month to find a hidden memecoin like wining a lotery.

After that, the platform said they couldn’t support the transaction and explained that it was because I sent USDT using the wrong network (meaning I lost the money and couldn’t recover my assets).

Can someone explain this to me? I don’t understand why the platform can’t recover the funds, considering Wormhole is a protocol on Sol, and my transaction is recorded on the blockchain (Solscan).

Please help me 😞  
After that, I shared the Solscan link with them and provided screenshots of the platform’s response.

Reddit,solana,"Pump.fun or FluxBeam and Raydium?
",2025-01-12 03:17:09,"Hi Everyone,

Myself and a group of colleagues have started a project that we are wanting to compliment with a solana based token, but can't decide whether to just launch on [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) or go the *slightly* more technical route and use FluxBeam (using a helpful guide found on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/194x5zz/guide_how_to_create_and_launch_your_own_meme_token/)).

The obvious plus to pumpfun is that they take care of the liquidity but the downside is you're essentially a memecoin and never going to be anything but (we can probably live with this label and look to market ourselves differently online).

I believe (correct me if I am wrong) setting up with FluxBeam and adding liquidity via Raydium would give us more more control over the token, especially if we want it to function as a utility token) but is slightly more technical.

The main reason for the post was to get some steer on liquidity and drumming up organic trading (outside of the marketing we would be doing). If anyone can help with the following questions I would be incredibly greatful!

\- If we setup with FluxBeam and add liquidity ourselves, how much is the 'suggested' amount? To avoid snipers and bots draining us? Is 15 Sol too little?

\- Would this method also make the pairing available to view on DexScreener fairly quickly?

\- Given how many new coins are launched on pumpfun, is it almost harder trying to stand out on there than trying to market a fresh coin not created on pumpfun?

\- Any other advice you have on making this choice is greatly appreciated!",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,solana,"I Have Been Seeing Posts on Sniping, and to Be Absolutely Frank, It Is Nothing but Damaging",2025-01-11 16:11:19,"For some time now, I’ve had an idea for a multi-chain meme project - starting on Solana and bridging to Ethereum - with the sole purpose of building something cool.

Fast forward to our launch date: everything was ready - the website, the X account, the Telegram group, visuals, tweets, and a lot of excitement. The concept revolved around a character waking up on Solana as an SPL token, realizing it had switched networks, and having one goal: to return and reunite with his beloved son on Ethereum. But enough about the meme lore.

On December 31, 2024, we launched. The chart looked healthy, with organic growth for some time. However, having all our socials and the website connected to the launch made us a target for malicious actors eager to piggyback on our hard work.

Before we knew it, we bonded and reached a market cap of nearly $200k. Unfortunately, a sniper managed to purchase 46% of the supply. It’s likely they hyped the project further through their own channels (speculating) before dumping their entire position and crashing the chart.

[Case study of a sniper attack ($ABU Moonshot launch on 12/31/24) : r/memecoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1hya1q9/case_study_of_a_sniper_attack_abu_moonshot_launch/)

This is a malicious, predatory act that cripples promising projects, drives investor losses, and perpetuates the narrative that crypto projects are just ""rug pulls."" In reality, many good projects fall victim to external forces beyond their control - actors like this sniper who exploit them for personal gain.

Reddit,solana,BullX fee: how to calculate all fees,2025-01-11 17:01:59,"I have this wallet address I used to test trade: HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w

The fees essentially ate all the profits. Even though eventually I set the buy priority fee to something small like 0.0001 and turned off MEV protection, gigantic fees still were charged.

For instance, I bought 5EYsHuyYGriuoYah7e9FfbSYuGW3vJevHnm2mtnJPfto (15M) and paid these fees:

Create account: -0.02203928 ($4)
Create account: -0.00203928 ($0.4)
Paying the token price to get token from Raydium pool: -0.02 ($3)
Then the token 15M is deposited to token account, and I get 
Close account: +0.00203928 transaction.

I assume this account 
https://solscan.io/account/5QiMQo2nQwkcvj2QcZJVpFSGBgGnXhrgL3vedsVuB6PM#transfers
is being created and closed (within a single Buy transaction).
What I also don't understand, why the Transfers in this account have (+0.02203928) and (-0.00203928), but the balance is zero? Shouldn't 0.02 be left?

Then I pay another fee -0.0002 ($0.03) and another -0.002 ($0.39)

I realize that 0.00203928 is the fixed Solana fee for opening a token account (https://solscan.io/account/2fKFFfY9BYBECReK2PNgqe6UhxHhrTg7x9jYjGvWrh1H), but I have two Create account transactions, I assume one of them (the one with -0.02203928 fee) is made by BullX?


These are all transactions, from the first Buy to the last Sell of the token:

https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736344500000&time=1736345300000#transfers

For selling I only paid -0.00203928 to Create account, and -0.000261668 transfer fee, and -0.001 Jit fee (maybe didn't have MEV turned off for selling?)

Another example, buying and selling MLG Doge token: https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736286500000&time=1736286690000#transfers

To Buy I paid -0.02203928, -0.00203928 to create account. -0.0002 and -0.002 transfer fees. Essentially around $5 in fees just to Buy. For selling it's -0.00203928 create account fee, -0.000248179, -0.002, -0.0001 transfer fees.

Looks like the initial 0.022 accounts for the majority of the fees, what is that thing?

At the same time, when I first buy Emma token (BznQ5VeNfJVY94KdMByFPNH7Ri9qTLWCHMLfcd6Rpump, transactions: https://solscan.io/account/HxSrjAi9aY9mz2mk34tpUoEvTTPUZYM7o6XrEu52EZ2w?remove_spam=true&exclude_amount_zero=true&time=1736350580000&time=1736639999000#transfers), I only pay -0.00203928 fee to create account (a single create account transaction). Before, when I was selling tokens, I would get - token and + WSOL, but with Emma, I only have -193,848.691919 token transaction and now +WSOL following it, like usual. I go on to buy more of it +225,960.354818 and sell later -225,960.354818, but no +WSOL transactions at all.

Could someone help me make sense of BullX fees and what's going on with these examples?",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,solana,Educational Blog Post | Solana Token Accounts Made Simple: Why Should You Close Them? (Written by RayBot intern),2025-01-09 20:06:53,"**Source:** [https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9](https://raybot-sol.medium.com/solana-token-accounts-made-simple-why-should-you-close-them-91c9174cd5c9)

On Solana, associated token accounts (ATAs) are essential for managing tokens. But what happens when you no longer need a specific token account? That’s where the “close token account” transaction comes in. Let’s explore why and how you might close an ATA, and the benefits of doing so.

[https:\/\/t.me\/ray\_magenta\_bot](https://preview.redd.it/mrlvvwoqy0ce1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8063f79b43829bc5d71e8607c2639023379f0acb)

# What Does It Mean to Close an Associated Token Account?

Closing an associated token account is like cleaning out a locker at the end of the school year. Once you’re done using it — say, you’ve sold all the tokens — you can “close” the account. This deletes the account and refunds the rent (SOL) used to maintain it.

>

# Why Close an ATA?

There are a few key reasons you might want to close an associated token account:

1. **You No Longer Need It:** If you’ve sol all the tokens and don’t plan to use that token again, closing the account cleans up your wallet.
2. **Save on Rent Costs: Each account you maintain uses a bit of SOL. By closing unused accounts, you can reclaim those funds.**

# How to Close an ATA

There are many tools that can help you close ATA accounts. Here’s how it works:

1. **Ensure the Account Is Empty:** Before closing an account, make sure it has a balance of 0. You can do this by transferring or selling any remaining tokens to another wallet or account.
2. **Use a Cleanup Tool:** Use one of the well-established tools to close your accounts. For instance, go to [Sol Incinerator](https://sol-incinerator.com/#/) (one of the most popular tools for wallet cleanups) and select “CLEANUP.” It will display all your vacant accounts. There are other tools offering the same functionality — do your own research (DYOR).

The “close token account” transaction is a simple yet powerful tool for optimizing your wallet on Solana. By closing unused accounts, you save money, keep your wallet organized, and contribute to the overall health of the network. Whether you’re a casual user or a developer, understanding and utilizing this feature can make a big difference in your Solana experience.

So next time you spot an empty token account in your wallet, consider closing it — your SOL balance will thank you!

https://preview.redd.it/b6u67k5n01ce1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a96b9488bb6a1f202aa4bc1c546346abb9bb3fab

We launched [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) in early 2024 with the goal of empowering developers to compete, experiment, and build products across a broad spectrum of crypto use cases through our online hackathons. In partnership with the Solana Foundation and numerous ecosystem organizations, we’ve built the largest hackathons in crypto and helped accelerate the rapid growth of Solana’s startup ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/f6354joq01ce1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf37ffc7659f232fb0275d195c444222b7040756

Following each major Solana hackathon ([Renaissance](https://www.colosseum.org/renaissance?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Radar](https://www.colosseum.org/radar?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), we accepted two accelerator batches each with 10+ winning teams. And to date, we’ve made pre-seed investments in 20+ startups. Reviewing thousands of hackathon submissions and working with talented founders in our accelerator program has given us an up close view of crypto's rapidly emerging markets. As the year comes to a close, we’re excited to share our perspective on 12 high-growth verticals where we saw exciting development in 2024, and that we believe will continue to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. In addition, we highlight the hackathon winners and teams we’ve backed who we believe are creating the markets that will drive each category forward.

*Note: Many of the projects mentioned below are currently on devnet, with mainnet deployments expected in Q1 and Q2 2025.*

**Non-Sovereign SoV Assets**

Over the past decade, Bitcoin has proven that a non-sovereign store-of-value (SoV) asset can gain global acceptance and secure a core position within the global financial system. While Bitcoin’s incredible success validated the concept, we believe it also opened the door for additional digital gold-like assets to reach escape velocity and meaningful liquidity in the coming years.

[Ore](https://x.com/OREsupply?ref=blog.colosseum.org) stands out as the most promising non-sovereign asset tailored specifically for onchain ecosystems. Strong community support, thoughtful economic design, and increased liquidity—fueled by “Boosts” on key trading pairs—[positioned Ore well in 2024](https://x.com/mattytay/status/1870887900663169059?ref=blog.colosseum.org). We’re excited to see the core team use these structural advantages to build new products that further its adoption in the broader onchain economy.

**Futarchy**

DAOs have long struggled with governance, often relying on 1-token-1-vote structures that can stifle progress, resulting in a waste of both human and treasury capital. MetaDAO offers a transformative “[futarchy as a service](https://metadao.fi/?ref=blog.colosseum.org)” framework, enabling organizations to make decisions through markets rather than traditional voting mechanisms.

[MetaDAO](https://x.com/MetaDAOProject?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is already integrated into leading projects like Drift and Jito. We believe futarchy will continue to solidify itself as the default governance module in the Solana ecosystem (and crypto more broadly) in 2025—one that overcomes entrenched governance challenges and accelerates dynamic decision-making.

**Decentralized Stablecoins**

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT have achieved widespread adoption, and crypto-native products such as Ethena are also on the rise. However, existing stablecoin implementations often sacrifice censorship resistance, capital efficiency, or both.

A new wave of experimentation is underway, with the aim of creating stablecoins that offer robust stability while also delivering more decentralization, transparency, and higher yield potential. [Reflect](https://x.com/ReflectCX?ref=blog.colosseum.org) and [Hylo](https://x.com/hylo_so?ref=blog.colosseum.org) represent two of the most promising protocols leading the decentralized stablecoin renaissance in 2025.

**Crypto’s Growth Stack**

As consumer-facing products begin to dominate venture funding in the Solana ecosystem, the need for sophisticated growth tools will increase in lockstep. Just as Web2 startups have grown up around powerful analytics and marketing tools, Web3 builders are now developing their own data-driven growth engines to meet their unique needs.

[Torque](https://x.com/torqueprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is one such product, providing a powerful onchain-native growth platform, enabling just-in-time user rewards based on a wide variety of behaviors. Prominent teams like Tensor and Metaplex already use Torque for targeted growth campaigns. Meanwhile [AdX](https://x.com/AdXso_?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team in our latest accelerator cohort, is building a decentralized ad exchange, granting both Web 2 and Web 3 projects direct access to effective distribution channels.

**High-performance Clients**

Currently, Solana’s network relies on two main node clients: Anza’s Agave and Jump’s Firedancer, the latter of which hasn’t been fully deployed yet. The Firedancer team has taken on the ambitious (and critical) effort of building a new client from the ground up, with a focus on high-performance. While we believe this will be a successful effort over the coming years, we also believe there are sustainable opportunities for monetizing more tightly-scoped validator improvements even sooner. 

[Rakurai](https://x.com/Rakurai_io?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a team of experienced engineers from Apple and high-frequency trading, are capitalizing on one such opportunity. Building on upcoming Agave releases, their validator client will integrate an optimized transaction scheduler that has benchmarked at up to 5x the current block rewards and yield boosts of over 30% compared to existing clients. We anticipate a continued increase in competition amongst validator operators, leading to better network performance for apps and users in the years to come.

**Crypto Developer Tooling**

As crypto matures, development teams require increasingly advanced tooling to secure, monitor, and scale their products. In traditional tech, tools like HashiCorp’s Terraform made cloud infrastructure management far simpler and more reliable for engineers. In crypto, [Txtx](https://x.com/txtxrun?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is poised to offer similarly transformative infrastructure—improving security, reliability, and reproducibility of workflows involving onchain programs/smart contracts.

For monitoring and rapid bug resolution, [Tokamai](https://x.com/gotokamai?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has also emerged as a crypto-native equivalent to Sentry, empowering developers to maintain application reliability through every layer of the stack.

**Onchain Yield**

While DeFi has introduced overcollateralized lending, capital-efficient yield remains elusive. The next phase of DeFi will bring more sophisticated yield markets onchain, enabled through true prime brokerage-like functionality and liquid staking fundamentals.

[Asgard](https://x.com/asgardfi?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is laying this groundwork by building a suite of DeFi protocols, including a spot margin aggregator and credit synthesizer. [Pye](https://x.com/pyefinance?ref=blog.colosseum.org), another hackathon winner, is creating a marketplace that allows stakers to tokenize and forward-sell their staking yield—further extending the frontier of DeFi 2.0.

The final team we backed in this vertical is [Watt](https://x.com/wattprotocol?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is building a volatility farming protocol utilizing market arbitrage to generate real yield for users and foster liquidity for the ecosystem as a whole.

**Private DeFi Infrastructure**

Transparency is a defining feature of DeFi, yet certain market participants prefer selective privacy. PayPal’s integration of confidential transactions using token extensions for its PYUSD stablecoin highlights a growing demand for privacy-enhanced financial infrastructure.

We believe this foreshadows in a new era of embedded privacy primitives for DeFi. [Darklake](https://x.com/darklakefi?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a recent hackathon standout, employs zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy-first dark pool trading platform.

**Sports Markets**

Sports are rapidly financializing: stadiums are integrating casinos, online betting is thriving, and college athletes are now receiving substantial compensation. Crypto is poised to expand and democratize these markets—enabling direct ownership, unique betting models, and new forms of engagement.

In our newest accelerator cohort, [AlphaFC](https://x.com/alphafcxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is pioneering the tokenization of sports fandom through real ownership of an English football club, and [Pregame](https://x.com/pregame_hq?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is building a new platform for direct p2p sports betting. We're excited to watch both of these endeavors expand crypto’s role in the sports economy.

**Virtual Infrastructure Networks**

DeVINs (Decentralized Virtual Infrastructure Networks) gained momentum in 2024 and we continue to see top founder talent launch a diversity of products in the space.

[BlockMesh](https://x.com/blockmesh_xyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) empowers users to earn passive income by leveraging their unused bandwidth, and is well on their way to building a strong network with over 500,000 extension downloads.  Meanwhile, [MeshMap](https://x.com/meshmapxyz?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is focused on building a 3D AR mapping network. Although mainstream AR/VR adoption is still in its infancy, we anticipate accelerated growth in these areas over the next 1-2 years. Finally, we also backed [DBunker](https://x.com/Dbunker_Network?ref=blog.colosseum.org), which is an aggregator and marketplace giving users the ability to participate across many DeVINs.

**Energy Markets**

Rising global energy demand and increasing climate pressures create volatility and opportunity. Southeast Asia, in particular, has seen high demand for innovative solutions to support a growing population with an aging energy grid. We’ve backed 2 India-based teams who are building novel token-incentivized infrastructure to serve this demand.

[DeCharge](https://x.com/DeCharge__?ref=blog.colosseum.org) has deployed over 150 EV charging stations within just a few months, and is expanding to the U.S. in Q1 2025, and [GreenkWh](https://x.com/GreenKWh?ref=blog.colosseum.org) is using battery packs to coordinate off-grid energy—both projects exemplify how crypto can reshape global energy infrastructure.

**Social Markets**

After a 2024 boom in memecoins, founders are now exploring deeper integrations of social media, token issuance, and gaming. The following teams are exploring use cases across a spectrum of community engagement to gamified token economies:

* [Banger](https://x.com/bangerdotlol?ref=blog.colosseum.org): An app that enables users to buy and sell “tweet tokens,” Curators to profit from high-volume tweet markets, and Creators to earn for their viral posts.
* [Peek](https://x.com/peekdotcyou?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A platform that leverages liquid crypto markets to gamify TikTok videos and content.
* [Supersize](https://x.com/supersizegg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A Mini-clip style gaming platform building an onchain PVP game where token communities wager and compete for dominance to become the largest “blob” on the map.
* [Monsters](https://x.com/monsdotgg?ref=blog.colosseum.org): A new game for memecoin communities, blending Pokémon-inspired mechanics with high-stakes betting.
* [Teamplay](https://x.com/teamplay_games?ref=blog.colosseum.org) (with Midcurve): A platform for creators to host private gaming sessions and contests, tightening community engagement and opening new revenue streams through a token-enhancing toolkit.

**Looking Ahead**

As we prepare to run more hackathons for the Solana ecosystem in 2025, we’re eager to learn from the next generation of founders and support the creation of novel crypto markets. One emerging force we’re closely examining is AI weaving its way into crypto landscape. While we don’t view AI as a standalone use case, we do see it as a transformative layer that will enhance all verticals.

Sign up at [colosseum.org](https://www.colosseum.org/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) to get notified about our upcoming hackathons—we can’t wait to see what you build next!

# 🚀 Investments and Themes for 2025

Colosseum launched in early 2024 to help developers compete and experiment across a wide spectrum of Solana-based products through online hackathons. 

Since then, the team has reviewed thousands of submissions, accepted multiple cohorts into its accelerator, and made pre-seed investments in more than 20 promising startups. 

Drawing on that hands-on experience, Colosseum has identified 12 high-growth verticals that are set to shape the Solana and broader crypto landscape in 2025, each one addressing real-world challenges.

A key theme running through all twelve verticals is a renewed focus on real-world utility and sophisticated market design. 

Whether it’s a sports fan token that unlocks new ways to engage with your favorite team, or a next-gen aggregator that forward-sells staked yield, these protocols aim to bring deep liquidity, better user experiences, and new revenue streams on-chain. 

And while Colosseum doesn’t see AI as its own siloed vertical, the team expects AI to become an indispensable layer across each of these categories by streamlining data insights, risk management, and user onboarding in ways we haven’t even imagined yet.

For developers and builders looking to stay ahead, these areas offer opportunities to create new markets and leverage existing ones. Expect these verticals to play an outsized role as we move into 2025 and beyond.

# ➰ Accounts Lattice Hash

Solana developers have introduced a proposal to tackle the [state growth problem](https://x.com/aeyakovenko/status/1789009684378382404?ref=blog.colosseum.org) by implementing a lattice-based system known as the Accounts Lattice Hash. 

According to the proposal ([SIMD-215](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0215-accounts-lattice-hash.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org)), ""the main goal is to scale Solana to billions of accounts and compute a ‘hash of all accounts’ in practical time and space.” 

One of the core changes involves homomorphic hashing, a method that verifies only the accounts that have changed, rather than reprocessing every account on the network. 

>Think of it like cleaning a house. Instead of scrubbing every single room every day, you only tidy up the spaces that got messy.  
\~ Republik Labs

At the end of each epoch, Solana’s Epoch Accounts Hash mechanism must rehash all accounts. As the size of Solana state grows, this process becomes increasingly resource-intensive.

In contrast, the lattice-based method accumulates individual account hashes directly and updates only the accounts that have changed. 

By eliminating the need for full recalculations, the approach will reduce computational overhead. This upgrade also aims to preserve the network’s existing security level, offering a path to global scale without sacrificing safety.

If the community approves this improvement, Solana’s infrastructure could set a new benchmark for blockchain scalability.

# 🛡️ Quantum Resistant Winternitz Vault

Google’s quantum computing project [Willow](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/?ref=blog.colosseum.org) made headlines recently and raised concerns in the crypto world. 

Blockchains use cryptographic systems built on mathematical problems that quantum computers could solve much faster, ultimately making it possible to reverse-engineer private keys from public keys.

While we're still a long way off from that ever happening, Solana developer Dean Little has introduced the Solana Winternitz Vault, an optional quantum-resistant vault that leverages hash-based signature technology.

The Solana Winternitz Vault is essentially a specialized account system that uses hash-based signatures instead of traditional elliptic curve cryptography. 

The idea is simple: Each time a user makes a transaction, a new private key is generated and revealed, minimizing the chance of a quantum computer exploiting previously exposed public keys. 

Under the hood, it leverages Winternitz One-Time Signatures (W-OTS) along with a Merkle root structure for added security and tamper-proof verification.

While the vault is an entirely optional feature, its hash-based signature approach shows an awareness of quantum threats and a commitment to protecting user funds as quantum computing continues to advance.

[**Solana can be quantum-resistant today, here’s how**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solana-can-be-quantum-resistant-today-heres-how-614544fbccd8?ref=blog.colosseum.org)

# 🗳️ Solana Founder Survey

Lightspeed polled 42 anonymous Solana founders on a variety of topics in the Solana space. 

Many founders remain bullish on Solana’s trajectory and culture, even saying if Solana didn’t exist, they wouldn’t be in crypto at all. 

However, among those open to other ecosystems, Base and Sui ranked as the most appealing. 

Founders also shared concerns about MEV on Solana, noting it drives up costs and makes transaction ordering more complex.

Memecoins got a “mostly good” label from respondents where AI agents were called “overrated” and seen by some as mostly hype. 

On the infrastructure side, founders said the demand for blockspace is growing fast, and they want bigger blocks to keep fees manageable.

Overall, founder sentiment highlights excitement about the future of Solana, a desire to fend off rising MEV concerns, and a readiness to innovate with new use cases.

>**2/** 🙏 Firstly, a massive shoutout to our incredible angels: Solana founders [@aeyakovenko](https://x.com/aeyakovenko), [@rajgokal](https://x.com/rajgokal), fmr Coinbase CTO [@balajis](https://x.com/balajis), along with [@BigBrainVC](https://x.com/BigBrainVC), [@MonkeDAO](https://x.com/MonkeDAO), [@santiagoroel](https://x.com/santiagoroel), [@akshaybd](https://x.com/akshaybd), [@tamgros](https://x.com/tamgros), [@Austin\_Federa](https://x.com/Austin_Federa), [@kashdhanda](https://x.com/kashdhanda), [@TheOnlyNom](https://x.com/TheOnlyNom), [@R89Capital](https://x.com/R89Capital) to name a few❤️



>**3/** The Challenge: How do we onramp “the next billion users” to stablecoins if they live in countries where cash is still king?

https://preview.redd.it/iqgkjfrnu0ce1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa827818d26ff9774736ee751229742fc138015b

>**4/** 💡 The Solution: Leveraging existing “agent banking” networks

>• Mobile money agents form a hidden financial superhighway spanning all developing countries

>• Globally, 18M agents process $560B cash over the counter every year

>• These agents normally process cash for people’s bill payments, mobile topups, money transfers, remittances, etc



>**5/** 📈 Scaling our own agent network

>• DePIN incentive mechanisms allow us to programmatically scale token rewards by neighborhood, city and country

>• Early agents earn higher rewards, accelerating critical mass as we launch new markets

>• QR stands act as miniature billboards, sparking curiosity for digital dollars from all the foot traffic

>  
**6/** 📈 Massive untapped demand

>• DePIN platforms typically have trouble scaling demand side

>• However, emerging markets have massive unmet demand for dollars due to their scarcity through traditional channels.

>• People often pay 5-10% premiums to get their hands on dollars just to stuff them under their mattress or hide them in the closet.

>• ZAR democratizes access to the world’s strongest currency through easy access to stablecoins



>**7/** 🔍 How ZAR works: 

>1. Find nearby agent with the best fx rate

>2. Scan QR to trade 

>3. Hand over cash 

>4. Receive digital dollars instantly



>**8/** 🌐 Cash onramp infrastructure for all  

>• Our SDK enables any web3 app to integrate ZAR’s onramp/offramp 

>• Think of us like a MoonPay, but for cash onramping 

>• Building the Western Union/Moneygram of Web3

Reddit,solana,On how to build a wallet watcher,2025-01-09 02:43:42,"Every game in the world is won by knowing something the other players don’t. Crypto is no different. With the blockchain being public your job is to either be the winner with your own ideas or find the sharp plays made by the sharp accounts. Finding sharp accounts is still on you. But I’m here to share some insight into how to monitor these accounts with automation.

I’ve done a few YouTube videos sharing what I’ve learned about monitoring Solana transactions and I’ve done one about this topic. But with this subreddit’s understandable change to move away from links and self promotion I’ll be sharing this information in text format. 

This is just one way, but I think this is the fastest way to spin up a wallet watcher. The premise is that we can leverage a service provided by a company called Helius to monitor the transactions and alert an application we spin up with new updates from a wallet or account. Helius is one of the most reputable services to interact easily with Solana. Their free tier is generous and they offer a service that utilizes Webhooks, meaning that when Helius detects an account made a transaction, it will alert our application. Our application has to be hosted to receive webhooks. For my own use I am using Cloudflare Workers. It also has a generous free tier. But you can find hundreds of options for this part. 

I kept my tracker simple, when Cloudflare/the app receives the webhooks, it parses out the transaction and I have mine alert me via Telegram. 

That’s pretty much it. Helius to a quick Cloudflare Worker to Telegram. All you need to get started. I’ll try and update the post with the code later without a link for safety. But if you have any questions, my DMs are open. Best wishes ",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,solana,"Are meme coins quite literally only a giant pyramid scheme, please explain if not
",2025-01-08 16:11:37,"Edit: perhaps not a ‘pyramid scheme’ but rather MLM marketing 

I was initially thinking meme coins have value to them defined by the strength of the community and what we see today is a decentralization of marketing — if that makes sense.

For example, useless companies/brands are being sold for millions only due to the large audience it has accumulated. Now only a few at the top profit and everyone else gives all their money to them.

With meme coins (ideally speaking) everyone gets a stake of the profit sharing. No one cares about celebrities anymore — so whatever money they could have extracted from us we decided to just form our own community with it and we all have a chance of building together. Also, memes can be viewed as leverage to buy btc (which also implies the coin will have a short lifespan from an individual 'investor')

Of course, I’m leaving out the rug pulling as I’m talking of the what meme coins are supposed to be imo and not what inevitably happens to 99% of coins. But to answer the rug pulling, this is a byproduct of minimal regulations. As the sector grows and some regulation takes place, meme money will converge to the best memes that have proven its proof of concept.

Cool. But here’s where I’m at right now:

1. Memes have almost no intrinsic value
2. People buy a meme for its growth
3. Memes are not a store of value
4. Memes run on another crypto’s blockchain

These equate to the same very thick ceiling for all memes. Once a meme hits a certain MC, it’s basically a wrap for the meme. People don’t see it having quick growth anymore, it’s not a store of value, what if it grew so much you need to spend 1 SOL just to get a fraction of a meme, hey it’s dipping and there actually is not intrinsic value to any of this —> dump

So far, going long on any memecoin after initial hype almost always results in failure. Long as in 5yrs+. Doge is doing ight (although I’m sure most got burned) but only because of Elon.

So, given the above how can meme coins not be a giant pyramid scheme? I’m not even talking about rug pulling here. After an its growth, you have to cash out because memes don’t store value. They only Caveat I see is no one knows when it stops growing — but at the moment mc is a huge indicator.

My only optimistic conclusion so far is Solana just has to explode to increase the ceiling of these coins, and there needs to be a huge barrier for minting new memes thus other coins will have long term value. And I think memes are going to be around because gambling hasn’t gone anywhere.

My question is though, is a ‘strong community’ actually enough to support a meme coin, long term? People want to buy a meme, forget about it, come back 5yrs later and still be up.

* UK-based fintech firm Revolut became the first banking data publisher to join the multi-chain Pyth Network.
* Revolut will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth price feeds, allowing DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

Crypto-friendly fintech firm Revolut has become the first banking data publisher to join the Pyth Network.

 — a provider of real-time market data for onchain applications.

Revolut, which boasts over 45 million users across 200 countries, will integrate its digital asset quote and trade data into Pyth’s price feeds, enabling DeFi developers to incorporate it into their decentralized applications.

“Our partnership with Pyth is an important milestone in Revolut's journey to modernize finance,” Revolut Global Business Head of Crypto Mazen Eljundi said. “By working with Pyth to provide our reliable market data to applications, Revolut can influence digital economies by ensuring developers and users have access to the precise, real-time information they need.”

As a Pyth oracle network publisher, the digital banking platform will help secure the operations of hundreds of dapps, which can now access over 500 real-time feeds for digital and traditional assets, responsible for more than $1 trillion in total traded volume during 2024, according to a statement shared with The Block.

Other Pyth data publishers include Amber Group, Binance, Bitstamp, Bybit, Cboe, Cumberland DRW, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, Jane Street, OKX, Raydium and Wintermute.

“Pyth’s collaboration with Revolut is part of a larger trend we’re seeing, where traditional banking institutions, trusted by millions of customers globally, are recognizing the value of decentralized finance and digital assets,” Michael Cahill, CEO and co-founder of Douro Labs, core contributor to the Pyth Network, said. “Together, we are driving the future of finance, where transparent and reliable data empowers the next generation of financial applications.”

Originally designed for the Solana blockchain, Pyth Network now operates across more than 80 blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Aptos and Sui, providing real-time market data for cryptocurrencies, equities, FX and commodities.

# Revolut’s expanding crypto initiatives

In May 2024, the fintech firm launched a standalone crypto trading platform, Revolut X, in the UK, subsequently [expanding](https://www.theblock.co/post/326175/revolut-expands-crypto-exchange-30-markets) to 30 European countries in November. In September, Revolut was also [reported to be](https://www.theblock.co/post/317166/uk-fintech-firm-revolut-intends-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin-report) in the process of launching its own stablecoin.

Revolut [secured](https://www.theblock.co/post/307389/crypto-friendly-fintech-revolut-secures-banking-license-from-uk-financial-regulator) a banking license from the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority in July 2024, after a three-year application process. Obtaining a UK banking license is notoriously difficult due to the stringent regulatory and compliance requirements imposed by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority.

For several decades, the UK banking sector was dominated by large, established institutions, and no new banking licenses were granted until Metro Bank in 2010. The Bank of Dave campaign following the 2008 financial crisis highlighted the challenges of entering the sector, and subsequent reforms helped pave the way for several other new banks, including Monzo and Starling, which disrupted the market.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,ethereum,noob question about ethereum & coinbase,2025-01-11 22:01:18,"TL;DR: This stuff is confusing and I'm about to waste your time.

Let me tell you a tale of my ethereum adventure...

I saw something I could buy with ETH and figured hey, great time to finally get my feet wet with crypto -- as much for the learning as the end result. So I set up a coinbase account, connected my debit card, and bought $100 of ETH. Then coinbase was like ""you can now spin the wheel for a free gift!"" so I click the button and it says ""you are not allowed to spin the wheel"" or some shit. [edit: I know this sounds like I clicked an ad for a gambling site but it was just a silly promo offer for new accounts - not the end of the world for them to fail to fulfill it, just smells bad] Which leads me to find a bunch of reddit threads of people enraged at coinbase for poor service and support. Okay, well that's a good excuse to learn how to set up my own wallet. Not ready to get into hardware just yet, so I install metamask and create a wallet.

I go to coinbase to send my ETH to my wallet and it warns me to make sure that my wallet supports the same network, and I see coinbase uses the Base network, so (first mistake in 3... 2... 1...) I switch metamask to the Base network and do the transfer. In retrospect I think I could and should have switched coinbase to use Ethereum network instead. Didn't realize it stays tied to that network, though I get that now.

But anyway, now I go to the site with the thing I wanted to buy and it says I have to use the Ethereum network. Ugh so I gotta move it over. So I go to metamask and do a ""bridge"" to move my ETH from Base to Ethereum. But it fails... I think because metamask wants to take a service fee and it can only take it from Ethereum network (??) So.. I can't move my ETH to Ethereum because I don't have any ETH in Ethereum!

Okay, back to coinbase to buy another $10 of ETH to put on Ethereum network for the fee. But I already spent the $100 debit limit, so I add a paypal account and buy $10 of ETH, which turns out to be $9.75 cause this time they charge me a quarter for some reason.

Now to transfer my new ETH to my wallet on Ethereum network. BZZZT NOPE. Funds are ""Unavailable"" for 10 DAYS because clearing/security/blah/blah. Since when it does take 10 days to clear a $10 paypal transfer WTAF.

So now what? Looks like I could add my bank account directly for another funding source, but my appetite for connecting things to coinbase is waning rapidly. I could look into another exchange.. Binance? Kraken? But are they really any better?

If you've actually read this far, I'm interested in any thoughts. Does coinbase just suck or is this par for the course? Is there a different way for me to move my ETH from Base to Ethereum that doesn't require already having ETH in Ethereum?

Thanks!",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286
Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Developers: Help Build a Proof of Existence DApp & Blockchain,2025-01-11 21:50:22,"Hey fellow developers!

I'm embarking on a project to build a decentralized application (dApp) focused on **Proof of Existence**. This dApp will allow users to securely and immutably record the existence of digital or physical assets on a blockchain.

**Key Features:**

* **Secure Hashing:** Implement robust hashing algorithms (like SHA-256) to create unique fingerprints of user files.
* **Blockchain Integration:** Integrate with a suitable blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana) to store these hashes securely and transparently.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to upload files, generate hashes, and record them on the blockchain.
* **Timestamping:** Incorporate timestamping mechanisms to provide verifiable evidence of when the file existed.
* **Data Privacy:** Explore privacy-enhancing techniques (like zero-knowledge proofs) to protect user data while maintaining the integrity of the proof.

**Tech Stack (Open to Suggestions):**

* **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, or similar
* **Backend:** Node.js, Python (with frameworks like Flask or Django)
* **Blockchain:** Ethereum (with Solidity), Polygon, Solana
* **Smart Contracts:** Develop smart contracts to handle hash storage, timestamping, and potentially access control.

**I'm looking for developers who are passionate about:**

* Blockchain technology and decentralized applications
* Secure coding practices and cryptography
* User experience and interface design

**If you're interested in contributing to this project, please reach out!** I'm open to collaboration, code reviews, and any other forms of assistance.

**Let's build a secure and transparent Proof of Existence solution together!**",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

How does this address consistently chosen through RADAO? What am I missing something here?

My question may be duplicate but I don't have much time, I literally googled single time and there was not good answers so I decided to ask directly without any deep searchs so sorry for that.

last 3 month I got interested in blockchain technology and started learning. It was very interesting to learn architectural design behind some of them. ( I touched mostly bitcoin, ether and solana).  
At this moment I want to dive deeper in etherium so I need some guidence and advice where to start learning all the development concepts around it.

The address I discovered is constantly receiving small amounts of ETH (0.0000000...) and instantly transferring them to another address.

Reddit,ethereum,Build to earn: $25k technical grants to kick start your project from POKT,2025-01-09 13:11:10,"Hey folks, happy new year. This was popular on r/ethdev, so thought I’d share here, too:

I’ve been hacking on an NFT marketplace through the bear market, and we locked down a big win back in Dec to keep building - from a technical grants program from POKT. Our program lead encouraged us to tell some friends but they’re all already building w/ me lol

**TLDR**: [Read the docs](https://path.grove.city/develop/path/introduction), [apply to the incubator](https://www.pokt.network/apply), get in for $5k upfront, integrate their PATH SDK, get the remaining $20k paid over the year. I personally didn’t have to build something new or change my core product much to do this since I layered in a gateway on top of it.

***EDIT***\*: They just extended the application deadline to January 11th, so I’d apply ASAP if interested\*

**What is POKT?**

Pocket Network is one of the first decentralized RPC providers that has now evolved into a protocol called Shannon which lets anyone stand up apps and infrastructure on any open layer of data. Think decentralized LLM hosting providers and apps consuming LLM tokens. 

**With their PATH SDK and new Shannon network, anyone can now build on top of POKT.** This grant program is how they’re attracting the first few builders like us. Grove also handles the RPC side of things, with clients like Infura and a recent partnership with Ripple.

**What you need to know**

The POKT Gateway Accelerator Program is funded by the Pocket Network Foundation and it aims to foster the adoption and integration of their PATH SDK and Shannon network into various ecosystem projects. This grant not only provides financial assistance but also technical support and resources necessary for successful integration of gateways. Think of gateways as part of your app or it can be a full app like Dune that sits on top of open data. In our case, we’re integrating a Solana and Base Gateway that shows the volume of NFT trades on these platforms with AI to give traders a heads up on a trending NFT.

**The benefits**: $5k upfront, $20k over 1y after integration, technical support from the POKT team, and a community demo day to share with other builders.

**What you are expected to deliver**

1. **Integration Commitment**: The primary requirement is to integrate POKT's decentralized infrastructure into our core product. This involves setting up and maintaining a certain level of interaction with the Pocket Network.
2. **Milestone Deliverables**: We are required to reach specific developmental milestones, which include successful deployment and operation of our product features utilizing the Pocket Network.
3. **Updates and Participation**: Twice a week check in with our fellow cohort members and the program team, followed by monthly updates upon finishing. 

**What this means for us**

$25k for a few engineers who are just starting out with their first Web3 project is a pretty big deal, like a round of preseed funding, and we’re glad to get some bigger projects involved with what we’re doing. Best of all we’re giving up 0 equity as other programs give you as little as $20k and take 6% of your equity. 

The docs is a work in progress but the integration doesn’t look too hard while making our project more resilient and decentralized. Interview was fairly smooth, mostly interested in what we were building, and the whole program is remote OK. Recommend it!

Anyways yhe article was from 2 years ago or so. Some big brain and was actually very cool and informative (almost certain it was published on Medium). The cover image stuck with me though

Title was something like:

Ethereum is like a space colony // defi is like a base on mars // web3 is like a space station

I tried searching a bunch of alternatives. Idea was that all these separate moving parts make up this cool ecosystem like a space colony. Maker was in it, Uniswap, other big protocols had their own little base or building and thing were connecting. I think newer protocol was landing it’s ship and plugging in

Pretty sure is was specifically about Ethereum and not all of defi/web3.. but throwing it out there it could have been. The colors of the cover were light and similar to general EF tones.

Been searching for days and can’t find, hopefully someone remembers the actual article (cause I’d like to re-read it as well as reference the cover lol)

Reddit,ethereum,Built a tool for managing & sharing ETH/ERC-20 addresses professionally (Satosh.me),2025-01-08 20:02:47,"Hey Ethereum community! Built something I think could be useful for everyone dealing with multiple ETH/ERC-20 addresses.

**What it is:**

A simple tool ([Satosh.me](http://satosh.me)) that gives you a clean profile page (satosh.me/yourname) to organize and share your Ethereum addresses professionally.

**Key Ethereum Features:**

\- Support for ETH and all ERC-20 tokens

\- Clean way to share different addresses for different tokens

\- Support for ENS domains

\- Track which addresses are being engaged with

\- Dark mode interface (because Web3)

**Why I built it:**

\- Managing multiple addresses for different tokens was getting messy

\- Needed a professional way to share addresses with clients/community

\- Wanted analytics on which addresses get used

\- Tired of copying/pasting addresses from different places

**Technical Details:**

\- No custody of private keys

\- Just manages public addresses

\- Built on Next.js/React

\- Simple dashboard for address management

Everything's free for basic use, with a Pro tier for advanced features (30-day trial available).

Live at: [satosh.me](http://satosh.me)

**I'd especially love feedback from the Ethereum community:**

1. What other Ethereum-specific features would be useful?

2. Any ENS integration ideas?

3. What kind of analytics would be most valuable?

Looking forward to your suggestions on making this more useful for the Ethereum ecosystem!",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,ethereum,Accelerate L2 Interoperability: Update #0,2025-01-06 10:23:22,"https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-acc

I have copy-pasted the text below for those that would prefer to read it on reddit. The text is not mine I'm simply reposting for visibility, credit to their authors: Arbitrum, Base, ENS, MetaMask, Optimism, Phantom, Polygon, Taiko, World, and ZKsync.

**TL;DR:**

    We need to solve L2 interop to build the world computer 🌎 💻
    Most of what is needed to solve interop is already here today.
    We should be using a timescale of months rather than years. It is one of the highest priority items (right up there with increasing DA), and could be considered a type of liveness failure until solved.
    L2s & wallets are now collaborating closely on the first item: enable fast, trustless cross-chain sends.
    Stay tuned for more updates from this group 🤝

**Why interop matters**

Ethereum’s goal is to be the world computer – a place for anyone/anywhere to build and use new kinds of powerful, unstoppable applications.

To achieve the world computer vision, these applications need to be:

    Accessible to all users at all times:
    scalable (cheap to transact), permissionless, and censorship-resistant / secure
    Easy & low-friction UX
    switching between apps and chains should feel as simple as using a single chain

Ethereum has found a path to achieving #1 above (accessible at all times) through enabling low-cost L2s and moving some portion of user activity there. Though there is debate about how much / what types of activity should live on L2s, and how much / what type of improvements are needed for L1 execution (note: both can be done in parallel).

If the goal is to eventually serve billions of users, the World Computer (or any L1 blockchain) almost certainly will have a meaningful combination of activity on L1s and L2s (or L2-like things). It is critical that users are able to move easily and securely across all of the chains. If not, users will churn and migrate to a place that provides a more frictionless UX.

We should maintain focus on solving the most pressing problems for Ethereum’s users, or we risk letting short-term competitive dynamics get in the way of the longer-term (much larger) goal. Achieving the world computer vision means growing the pie 1000x.

**How do we get there**

The good news is that frictioness interoperability is already possible today. Most wallets support cross-chain swaps, there are several high-quality fast bridging solutions, and generally the Ethereum ecosystem is continuing towards a future where users don’t really have to think so much about what chain they’re on.

But there are a few key building blocks we still need to standardize in order to enable trustless, secure, and scalable communication across all chains in the Ethereum ecosystem (including non-evm chains).

An important part of this is making sure we solve things from a user-first perspective, and start with the most common user flows.

At the Ethereum Interop Forum in Bangkok, L2s came together on a shared goal:

users should be able to send assets from any chain to any other chain in 3 slots or less

The building blocks necessary to achieve this includes each of the following:

    On-chain registration of chain IDs (ERC-7785)
        L2s should register on ENS, rather than on a list maintained on GitHub.
    Chain-specific addresses (ERC-7828, which draws from ERC-3770)
        The chain should be part of the address, so that cross-L2 sending can be done just by putting the correct address into the “send” field.
    Cross-chain messaging & shared bridges
        There are many flavors of this being discussed, each with varying tradeoffs. We will need to align first on the ideal base layer here, and then more functionality can be built on top. See:
            ERC-6170
            ERC-7683
            RIP-7755
            ERC-7786
            ERC-7802
            ERC-7841
            ERC-7854
**
What’s Next**

L2s, wallets, and related infra across Ethereum are coming together to solve the initial goal set at the Ethereum Interop Forum of fast, trustless cross-chain sends:

    Finalize ERCs for (1) on-chain registration of chain IDs and (2) chain-specific addresses
    L2s and wallets begin implementation of these and ERC-7702 in parallel (programmable EOA wallets, coming in next hard fork)
    Unify the unification efforts, starting with cross-chain messaging
    Align on broader “interop roadmap”

If you are already working on interop, we’d love to hear from you. And for anyone else who’s just generally interested in getting involved please jump into the ERC discussion threads, join the next RollCall, or ping me directly.

Stay tuned for more interop updates 🤝",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,ethereum,Is my understanding correct of Ethereum vs Solana in terms of security?,2025-01-06 01:07:25,"I'm an old ETH miner back when it was around $10-20 and started to warm back up to it in recent days, having interacted on it in DeFi. I used to interact more on Solana until I realized the tradeoff and switched back to ETH and L2 rollups:

The hype surrounding Solana is the speed and transaction fees, but many don't realize the compromise they're making in terms of security. From my understanding Ethereum has over 1M validators post-EIP4488, which is significantly more decentralized in comparison to Solana's 2000\~. This could open up attack vectors that could compromise validators and the security of the Solana network: DOS, validator crashes, and a single layer of data availability, consensus and execution. In paying more for gas, I'll know that security is the most important to me.

Are there any technical folks who can verify what I'm saying is correct? Thanks

Reddit,ethereum,Seedy v1.0 Seed recovery and managment tool ,2025-01-06 08:24:06,"GM , Im reposting this Tool here from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) sub because I think many of you will find it useful to some extent (It does more than just recovery). My tool that I have named ""Seedy"" is a advanced etherium network (and all derivitives) seed phrase recovery and helper tool.

WHAT IT DOES:  
Its primary function is to provide a working Seed phrase, when it is presented with a partial seed phrase (ie; missing a word or two , or few\*\*) or a seed phrase that you are sure you wrote down correctly but your wallet is just not accepting it. Chances are your seed just has a incorrect word either by mispelling, wrote it in the wrong order, and just simply had a incorrect word altogether. This tool takes the words you got and as long as you know the address of your wallet it can (depending on words needed) search thousands of words per second searching through the entire dictionary for BIP seeds, one postition at a time. Once it finds the seed it displays it along with the confirmed address tied to it.

HOW IT WORKS

Each word in the phrase is a looked at as a position second word being position 2 for example. It starts at position 1, and checks the provided word against the bip dictionary , if its generated sequencial seeds match in any part of the address it moves to position 2 and repeats , position 3 , then 4 etc.

It happens very quickly but every single word is processed as a complete string of 12 ,15, 18, 24 words and then checked cryptographically to see if the checksum validates signifying its a valid seed phrase, if it is, it then derives the address that public key would provide. If the Key or part of the key matches the address the user provided it moves on to the next word. Eventually leaving the user with the final phraase - both matching the Private key derived from seed as well as a valid address. this data is presentted in an output log as well.

Every single valid combonation it attempts is logged in a text file thats built in the same folder as the tool upon running, this file is generated so the user can see the massive amounts and variable that had to be processed to eventually come to the end result, and for further study by the user.

IS IT RELIABLE?

So far it has been able to correclty find the missing or invalid words for seeds with upto 3 bad words within an hour - 2 words in 20-30 minutes , and if it is just a single word can be completed possibly within minutes sometimes seconds. The more complicated the math it needs to do, the longer it takes, and to be realistic anything over half a 12 word seed would take so long it would be impractical to use, with that being said - It will infact cointinue searching endlessly untill canceled , power/system failure, or it finally finds the correct phrase. NOW , this may seem impossible but its actually a very simple program with a unique approach based on a mathamatical algorythm I developed with the help of the Github community, and hours and hours of sleepless research. Nessesaty is the mother of invention , and thus my corrupt seed phrase (two missing words on ripped sheet of paper) was the only thing stopping me from accessing my funds after a hardware wallet failure. That failure and lost phrase caused me to create a tool to help me figure it out , and thats how Seedy was born.

WHERE TO GET IT ?

Its current version is 100% free so long as you have Python installed on your system (Mac, WIndows, Linux) and are able to download from Github. LINK AT BOTTOM . It currently is published as open source but may not remain Open forever. If there is a significant risk for malicous use discovered for example i may be forced to close source to help slow the creation of malicous tools using my code.

Other than That , thanks for reading and showing interest in my work, and I hope this helps many more people now that its been released from private beta testing.

Reddit,ethereum,A few questions to staking Ethereum,2025-01-05 03:55:29,"Starting to take crypto seriously after taking a break for 2 years after investing in altcoin. Now mostly Ethereum.  
  
A few questions I have about staking and cold wallet.  
I know most people here likes to stake in Rocketpool because of decentralization.

1. Why must one convert from ETH to rETH to stake? why can't we just stake ETH?

2. How do I safely stake my ETH directly from my cold wallet?

3. Won't there be depegging from ETH to rETH?

4. I know there are risks, but what are the chances of my funds being lost in Rocketpool?",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,ethereum,"""Vitalik Buterin Deserves a Nobel Prize in Economics for His Work on Crypto and Ethereum."": Bankless Co-Founder Ryan Sean Adams",2025-01-03 14:32:32,"In a tweet Ryan Sean Adams - co-founder of Bankless - said that Vitalik Buterin should be recognized with a Nobel prize in economics for his contributions to Ethereum and the entire crypto space. He said theres a disconnection between traditional economists and the revolutionary economic theories applied in DeFi and that Vitaliks genius most of the time goes unnoticed outside the crypto circle

I think Vitalik Buterin is definitely ahead of his time. He contributed to the creation of the portal to DeFi - yet like many visionaries I think global recognition of his achievements might only come long after his time. Everyone in DeFi knows Vitalik but to the rest of the world hes still relatively unknown. This lack of acknowledgment proves how far we are from true global adoption. Maybe we are still somewhat early

Both Satoshi and Vitalik built revolutionary platforms that changed the finance world forever. But crypto has been stained by rug pulls - pump and dump schemes - opportunistic influencers. This takes credibility away from Bitcoin and Ethereum and thats why a lot of people refuse to acknowledge that crypto is a genuine economic innovation

I wonder if one day Vitalik will be remembered as one of the greatest economic innovators of our time",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,ethereum,It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,2025-01-04 09:15:07,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

Reddit,ethereum,Degens & Dragons: Introducing Octant v2,2025-01-02 19:09:15,"Hi everyone!  Glad to see so much activity again on r/ethereum!!  Wanted to give everyone an update on Octant and where we are heading in 2025.

If you're unaware of [Octant](https://octant.app/), its a project built by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation/),  that facilitates sustainable, community-coordinated impact funding at scale. We’ve demonstrated the power of sustainable funding of impactful projects by staking 100,000 ETH (\~$350 as of today) and using much of the yield to fund broad based public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Over the past year, we’ve distributed millions of dollars to hundreds of open-source and impactful projects builders, supporting important projects such as Protocol Guild, Tor Browser, Funding the Commons, L2BEAT, BuidlGuidl, [and many others](https://octant.app/projects).

# Now we are ready to scale this far beyond our own means, to give Ethereum a massive competitive advantage.

TLDR: We are designing a system where ecosystems with a token AND sustainable value flows, or treasuries that can be deployed into yield bearing strategies can plug this tool into their community, and fund impactful ventures for ecosystem growth.  Collectively each participating ecosystem will contribute a small portion of value flow to fund Ethereum wide public goods.  The long version of this is explained below.

# Octant Protocol (aka Octant v2)

The Octant Protocol is a next iteration of Octant project.

It is a capital-efficient mechanism that captures yield from revenue-generating strategies and other value streams. It then routes this capital to allocation mechanisms for distribution in alignment with community preferences.

# User Personas & Key Terms

* **Dragons** are Web3 projects or decentralized communities with substantial treasuries and/or native ERC-20 tokens.
* **Regens** (existing Dragon community members) are tech-savvy, values-driven individuals who are deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Degens** are financially driven individuals who are highly engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Dragon Vault** \- a DeFi Vault that allows Dragons to deploy their capital and point the yield to the protocol
* **Dragon Pool** \- is a pool that receives a stream to fund the community ecosystem goods or other initiatives related to the Dragon community Pool
* **Dragon Token** \- an ERC20 token of the Dragon community
* **Regen (Community Members) Vault** \- is a DeFi Vault that allows Regens/Community Members stake the community token, receive rewards from the Dragons and use them to fund public and community goods
* **Sustainability Pool** \- is a pool that every Dragon contributes to. You can think about it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund of Ethereum.

# Octant V2 High-Level Design

https://preview.redd.it/rft0r98ppmae1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25ca45d46c9dd4575da5f56a1580e541d5076d2

The diagram above illustrates the workflow of a Dragon engaging with the system. The protocol allows multiple Dragons to join and deposit capital into their own Dragon Vaults, while all Dragons contribute a percentage of their yield to the Sustainability Pool.

You can think about the Sustainability Pool as a Sovereign Wealth Fund that is used to fund public goods and impactful projects.

The Dragon Vault deploys that capital into yield-generating strategies. These strategies may include ETH staking protocols, DeFi protocols, etc. The Vault then divides the funding stream between the Dragon Pool, Sustainability Pool, Regen Vault, and other pools/vaults the Dragon wants to utilize.

For instance, if Golem Foundation (GF) joins the protocol as a Dragon, it deposits its capital into the Dragon Vault. GF's main sustainable funding stream is solo-staking of 100K ETH on its own infrastructure. The staking rewards or other forms of yield are divided in the following way:

* 15% is deposited into the Sustainability Pool to support public goods that benefit everyone
* 35% forms Matched Funding and is deposited in the Dragon Pool, enabling the community to create funding rounds
* 25% goes into the Regen Vault to reward the community
* Another 25% is claimed by GF to cover the operational costs of running solo-staking infrastructure

The Dragon community creates funding rounds from the continuously flowing funds into the Dragon Pool. Regens (community members) then vote with the accumulated tokens using an allocation method, and these votes determine how the funds are distributed.

It's worth noting that this model may include a mechanism that swaps the yield into the Dragon Token. This creates buy pressure for the token and then rewards both regens and projects with it.

# Alignment Token (Basket) & Sustainability Pool

https://preview.redd.it/jntbx9yqpmae1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee930af6651e7af4b9940020a58ed1c2ecbc39b

The cornerstone of the Sustainability Pool design is the basket (alignment token). This token encapsulates ETH and all the Dragon Tokens, which are continuously converted and deposited into its contract, minting a single token (e.g., OCT) into the pool. Recipients of funding from that pool receive the basket tokens, which they can then sell on the market to finance their development efforts.

Users of the Regen Vault can continuously withdraw and/or vote with their attributed rewards in the rounds (or donate to continuous streams) created from the Dragon Pool or Sustainability Pool.

# Impact Bonds

https://preview.redd.it/891ra8vrpmae1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=622e4427f555db33836d69945657de53a0f6a42e

When users vote for projects, they receive impact bonds for each project they support. The system automatically mints the bonds and distributes them to the funders. The projects themselves don't receive any bonds. This mechanism rewards users who participate in voting.

After a set period, the Sustainability Pool buys back the impact bonds of certain projects, effectively signaling which projects were most impactful. The Pool allocates a certain percentage of OCT tokens (for example, 10%) to buy back the bonds. The Dragons make the decisions of which projects have their bonds purchased, potentially informed by Impact Evaluators. This approach guarantees future purchase of the bonds. In essence, this functions as an impact prediction market, assuming the buybacks are based on proper impact evaluations.

# Summary

https://preview.redd.it/5n4goouspmae1.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a793594af98640b74d5ec1ebed8296c859ce4cb3

The image above illustrates Octant's flywheel, which brings together diverse ecosystem participants and creates incentives for collaboration. Our goal is to align ecosystem players with varying motivations, fostering cooperation to achieve a balance between individual rewards and funding for impactful projects.

Please ask any questions you may have!  We have our next public goods funding round beginning January 11th.  To learn more about Octant, join our discord: [https://discord.com/invite/octant](https://discord.com/invite/octant) ",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

Reddit,ethereum,EIP-7702 vs EIP-4337: What's the difference regarding Account Abstraction?,2025-01-02 05:31:30,"Hi!

Can someone explain the difference between EIP-7702 – *which will be included in the Pectra upgrade* – and EIP-4337 – *which has been deployed in 2023* – regarding Account Abstraction (AA)?

As far as I understand it, EIP-7702 will allow:  
\- gasless transactions / gas sponsoring: the user could pay in another token like USDC.

\- transactions budling

  
But I thought this was already possible with EIP-4337. What does EIP-7702 brings on the AA, compared to EIP-4337?

Reddit,ethereum,"Transfer went wrong, please help me",2025-01-02 10:32:35,"I did 2 money transfers from Gatehub wallet to Revolut wallet. Regarding BTC, I pushed « receive » on Revolut and it gave me a BTC wallet address, which I copy pasted after pushing « transfer BTC » on Gatehub.

I did the exact same thing for Eth.

Long story short, money has left Gatehub, and never reached Revolut. It’s been 12 hours now and I’m worried a lot.

On the blockchain sites it says that the transfer is successful.

I am no crypto expert, can anyone here help me  find my money ?

Ps : wrote to revolut, they said they don’t know where is the money, and that they are looking

Ps 2 : wrote to Gatehub support but it’s the least responsive support ever. So I’m adding their team on LinkedIn..

Please help

EDIT : Turns out Gatehub sent BTC and ETH on XRP network which is not managed by Revolut. But they still found a way to recover the funds !! So money is safe for now 🤙🏼

Thank you to all the people who tried to help. 🙏🏻

1. Swap rETH (on mainnet) to USDC (on mainnet) on a DEX.  Bridge USDC to Arbitrum using Arbitrum bridge at 1:1.  (I find I get more USDC for rETH on the mainnet, but bridging USDC will convert it to USDC.e? which isn't good? There's also a swap done on the mainnet which requires more gas.)

2. Bridge rETH from mainnet to Arbitrum on Arbitrum bridge at 1:1. Swap rETH (on Arbitrum) to USDC (on Arbitrum) on a DEX.  (I find the rETH to USDC rate is worse on Arbitrum, but you get USDC instead of USDC.e.)

These are the two ways I can think of.  Is there a better way?  It seems I won't be able to use USDC.e on AAVE, right?  Or when you bridge USDC, do you get to select which type of USDC you recieve on Arbitrum?  OR is it automatically USDC.e?

Reddit,ethereum,Gas fee consumption on Base VS mainnet,2024-12-31 03:54:44,"Hi all, 

We launched a project on mainnet recently and experienced an issue around excess ETH above max wallet in transactions being consumed as gas. 

Examples:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x627093be03913cac939c990efde1817f52cad09b5074cd724b192101372ee054

https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1c94916133f374d21d3fe0339654934c99e9700e99393673b86bf1d2e013298
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe6cb711184f7c2e187d7c8dab192cd739cdf21f9c2210d8dd920e0219ba102e5

Contributing factors: 
- very high gwei pricing at time of launch
- max wallet 0.25% on launch
- low initial liquidity
- high gas usage by transactions (due to contract complexity)

Results were that those that attempted to send more ETH than max wallet was worth resulted in the remaining ETH in the transactions being consumed as gas. 

We are going to migrate to Base in order to significantly lower all transaction costs. I am trying to determine if this issue will follow us to Base on relaunch. 

Things that will be different on relaunch:
- higher initial liquidity
- max wallet now 2%
- no whitelist launch so less people botting launch with unlimited gas limits

In my testing on Base Sepolia, TX's that exceed max wallet all fail. 

Just hoping to get some insight into these transactions as the result was obviously not ideal for the project. 

My impression is that this issue will not follow us to Base, simply due to gwei pricing. Even if the transaction consumes the gas limit, this will still only be a couple of dollars. 

Any opinions or insight would be awesome. Cheers. ",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

I’m just getting started with learning about smart contracts, and honestly, I’m pretty excited (and a little overwhelmed). Ethereum has always fascinated me, and I finally decided it’s time to stop just reading about it and actually start building something.

For those who’ve been in my shoes, any advice? Like, what’s one thing you wish someone had told you when you were starting? Or maybe a resource you found super helpful?

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,2024-09-03 01:05:33,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](http://cryptache.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Bitcoin-Standard-The-Decentralized-Alternative-to-Central-Banking-PDF-Room.pdf)

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,F**k boring nodes - I CNC-machined and built my own Bitcoin full node,2025-01-12 09:55:28,"Enjoy the video. 🙂

Some additional information:

The idea was to run a full node on a Pi 4/5 and have it sit on my desk. So it must be passive cooled to be silent. Unfortunately I didn't find a case that met my high design requirements so I cnc-machined my own from aluminum. 

My requirements:
The Pi 4 and 5 have their USB-C and Ethernet ports on different sides so cables stick out in various directions which doesn't look great. Furthermore I wanted to utilize a NVME SSD and have the entire setup cooled passively.

Components:
- RPI CM4 (CM5 wasn't out mid 2024)
- Waveshare CM4-IO-BASE-C board
- 1 TB M2 NVME SSD
- CNC-machined aluminum case & lid
- thermal pad
- screws, studs, bumpers, small parts

Super happy with the result.
Looks great and is absolutely silent.
Cost approximately €400.

1) Read about the history of money and understand why Gold was the best currency

2) Accept the fact that government fiat money is manipulated against us via dilution and inflation

3) Start the journey of being a Bitcoin Maxi

4) And most importantly, NEVER CASH OUT OF BITCOIN. Even at $100M a coin.

Let me be clear on the fourth point. It's fine to BUY things with Bitcoin, like a house or a business, or to spend it on your daily living expenses, but not to sell and convert a significant amount to fiat money.

There is no proof this man has ever even owned the Bitcoin he claims to have lost. Regardless, it’s scientifically impossible for a hard drive to have survived this long in an open air landfill. 

This story is literally just clickbait for online articles, unless you’re from Newport then it’s a financial burden on you because the guy keeps trying to sue local authorities just to give “news” outlets a slightly different headline to repackage the story yet again. He sued the city for £500m just because newspapers like his story and give him credibility where he has zero. He also keeps trying to scam “investors” to fund his dig, which will never happen.

This person will keep rinsing and repeating until Bitcoin hits 1 million and beyond. The only way to deal with it is to stop talking about it and to brand James Howells posts as low effort clickbait. This scam operation has gone on for long enough.

Given the current bull market and the potential future growth, would you recommend starting to DCA into Bitcoin now, or is it more prudent to wait for a market correction? I'm interested in hearing about your experiences and any insights you might have on the effectiveness of DCA during bullish periods.

I’ve read a few great Bitcoin books and they’ve really deepened my understanding of Bitcoin’s economics, history and philosophy.

I’m looking for fresh inspiration - books that approach Bitcoin from unique angles. Whether it’s about the technical side, the societal implications, the philosophical aspects or even Bitcoin’s role in geopolitics, I’m open to anything thought-provoking.

Bonus points for books written recently or offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of Bitcoin and its adoption.

What are your must-read Bitcoin books?

Reddit,bitcoin,Bitcoin Core crashed out -- debug.log shows something I've never seen,2025-01-12 06:49:02,"I've been running Bitcoin Core (currently latest version, OSX) for many years, and I don't actually recall it ever crashing... but it did, and this is what the debug.log looks like. I've never seen anything like it, and don't really know what to make of it. As far as I know, my blockchain is pristine. The computer it runs on does nothing else except run this node, it's fully firewalled and, afaik, is not making any outside connections apart from this. I mention that in case anyone thinks somehow some bad actor got into my system and corrupted it. Supremely unlikely, because there's no evidence of it, but... is it possible?

  
Also, wondering what I should do. There's a sizeable balance of BTC in the wallet, and of course I have the (encrypted) wallet.dat backed up,  so no real concern there... but I'm tempted to blow up my blockchain and re-download it all, and create a new wallet and move the BTC into the new one (note, the old one never had any transactions going out, so I think it's totally ok, but still).

Anyway, perhaps there's no such thing as ""overkill"" in a case like this and I should do all of this, but before I do, I'd like to understand what happened and I welcome your thoughts.

The idea is that other users/visitors can show their appriciation by sending a few sats by clicking on the lightning icon.

It's still in developing but the functions should work, I've found that what works well for me doesn't necessarily work the same way for someone else. I've tried different wallets like Phoenix, WOS, and Breeze. 

It would help me a lot to get some feedback. If you encounter some problems let me know what kind of phone you are using and which wallet, connected with your own node or using a service. You can also DM I you want too.

The first was that an EU country had adopted its quantum resistant tech.  The announcement came with this note:  
  
 ""*Note: For national security reasons, the name of the EU country described in this release cannot be disclosed, nor can specific details about the exact use case.*""

So, you can't verify it, so it's probably fake, right?

Well, the news also comes along with Patrick Storchenegger, who you can find on linked in following Qanplatform.  He is an Ethereum foundation board member, a lawyer, and can be seen in the pictures of the announcement, plus in pictures from when Qanplatform launched its privatenet.

So, do we think he would allow his name to be associated with all of this if it was made up? 

They then announced IBM partnership:  ""We are introducing QAN Q-Cluster, a tamper-proof and self-auditing system that utilizes AI for log anomaly detection and incorporates quantum-resistant blockchain technology for provable durability and persistence. ""

Here again- they have a picture and news that landed on nasdaq articles.    
  
*But you can't dig anywhere to see a direct statement from IBM.*    
  
So, it's probably fake, right?

Well, just prior to the announcement, they attended JAM IBM Hungary where Johann was invited as a speaker, and all the attendees from the photo were present.    
  
Do we think they were able to get a photo and then went on to create a major partner announcement plastered all over and IBM just looked the other way?    


And then we see that they became 1 of 20 members in the Linux Post Quantum Cryptography foundation.  1 of 20 members next to IBM, AWS, NVIDIA, META, GOOGLE  
  
The fun doesn't stop there- but those are the major ones.

Closed github?  Yes, to protect key IP.  But privatenet and public testnet are available to work with.  This will become open source as they launch mainnet and have first mover advantage with their ecosystem.

Hacked?  Yes, the token contract got hit (not the mainnet product).  They went through a lot of pain and fully restored everyone.  If they aren't legit, why not just spin up a new scam?  Clearly only a determined team with tech that has a future would have pushed through to where they are now.

Quantum threat is 10 years away?  The expectation to be prepared is less than 5.  Governments and business are upgrading cryptography, and regardless of when the threat arrives, the expectation will be there.  But, even without the quantum narrative, the team has a product that will reach untapped markets.  They just won't have the upgrade mess facing 99% of chains in these coming years.    
  
Team doesn't give a lot of updates on progress?  Yes, and they don't seem too concerned about feeding retail hype on a weekly basis.  A quiet confidence.

I've heard some investors look for friction- meaning what are the reasons they are potentially accumulating at a price not everyone else has already bought into.  Well, if that's you, there is more than enough friction here.  Cheers

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why is it that retail gets shaken out with every major price correction if crypto just keeps going up and up over time?,2025-01-12 01:23:12,"Why is it that, every time the market experiences one of those sharp, unexpected corrections, it’s always the retail investors, the ones who have carefully saved and taken calculated risks, who end up selling at a loss? It seems to be a pattern, one that’s so familiar it almost feels inevitable. You’d think people would learn from past cycles, especially considering the way the market tends to correct itself over time. But no, it’s like clockwork. When the market turns south, it’s the individual investors, the retail traders, who are the first ones to panic. They sell, lock in their losses, and then watch in frustration as the market eventually rebounds, often much higher than it was before the crash.

Is it that they don’t fully understand the nature of markets—that they’re cyclical, that volatility is just part of the landscape, and that corrections, while uncomfortable, are really just an opportunity in disguise? Or is it something deeper, something psychological? Maybe it’s that the average person is simply wired to react to uncertainty in a certain way—maybe we all feel that instinctual urge to protect ourselves when things start to slip away, even when the facts don’t warrant such a drastic reaction. Because, let’s face it, watching your investments take a dive, especially if you’ve put in a significant portion of your savings, is a terrifying experience. The numbers on the screen feel very real. It feels like losing something tangible, not just digits that can be replaced.

But the strange thing is, we’ve seen this story before. We’ve seen it in 2008, we’ve seen it in 2020, and countless other times throughout history. Yet, every time, individual investors seem to fall into the same traps. They buy in when the market is soaring, drawn in by optimism and the fear of missing out on the next big thing. The hype is contagious, and the more they hear about others making money, the more they feel they need to jump in. But by the time they do, the market has already started to turn. Prices are high, and the risk is already much greater than they realize. Then, when the inevitable correction hits, it feels like a gut punch.

What’s more puzzling is that even when the pattern is so clearly laid out—markets go up, they correct, and then they go up again—the retail investor still can’t seem to weather the storm. It’s almost like they expect something different to happen, as though the rules of the game have somehow changed. Maybe that’s the problem: they don’t truly understand the game. They see markets as a kind of lottery, with the potential for big wins in a short period of time. But that’s not how markets work. The big players, the institutions, the ones who’ve seen this cycle time and time again, know that downturns are simply part of the process. They understand that the real gains come over the long term, that staying in the game and riding out the volatility is the key to success.

But why does the emotional reaction to these corrections seem so much stronger for the individual investor? Is it because they don’t have the same resources or the same emotional distance from their investments? Institutional investors often have entire teams of experts guiding their decisions, helping them stay focused on the long-term horizon. Individual investors, on the other hand, are often making decisions in isolation, with very little support or guidance. And in an environment where the media plays a huge role, it’s easy to see how panic can set in. After all, when you hear about the market crashing, when you see those headlines, it’s hard not to feel like you’re about to lose everything.

Yet, for every person who panics and sells during a downturn, there’s another person, usually with more experience and a longer-term outlook, who is quietly buying. For every seller, there’s a buyer. And who are these buyers? They’re the big institutions, the players who are able to take advantage of these corrections because they’ve seen it all before. They know that downturns are temporary, and they’re willing to wait for the inevitable rebound. So, why is it that individual investors can’t seem to see that same opportunity? What’s missing from the way they approach these market corrections?

Maybe part of it comes down to experience. The more you’ve been through market cycles, the easier it is to take a step back and recognize the larger trends at play. You know that the market doesn’t go up in a straight line—it’s always going to have ups and downs. But if you’re new to the game, and you’ve never been through a serious correction before, it’s easy to fall prey to the emotional highs and lows. You might feel like you’re missing out when the market is rising, and when it drops, it feels like you’re watching all your hard work go down the drain.

And then there’s the issue of leverage. Many individual investors get involved with borrowed money—whether it’s through margin trading or loans—which can amplify both gains and losses. When the market drops, these investors are often forced to sell to meet margin calls, adding additional selling pressure and further pushing prices down. But once again, the institutions are the ones who benefit. They have the capital to weather these drops, to buy when others are forced to sell, and to come out ahead in the long run.

So, is the problem simply a matter of knowledge or experience? Is it that individual investors just need to better understand how markets work, to learn that corrections are normal and even healthy for the long-term growth of an asset? Or is it more about managing emotions—about learning to control the fear that takes hold when the market turns against you? After all, the people who succeed in these markets aren’t the ones who buy at the highs and sell at the lows; they’re the ones who buy when others are afraid, when everyone else is selling, and who wait patiently for the market to correct itself.

It’s tough, though. When you’re staring at a 30% drop in your portfolio, it’s hard not to panic. You don’t have the luxury of hindsight. You don’t know for sure that the market will rebound, especially when it feels like the bottom could fall out. But this is where the big players have the advantage. They’ve seen it before. They know that these corrections are temporary, that markets always come back eventually. It’s not a matter of if—it’s a matter of when.

Now, I say all this, and I’ve been in the game long enough to have seen my fair share of market downturns. I can tell you from personal experience that the hardest part is when you’re in the middle of a correction, especially when it feels like the world is falling apart. And maybe that’s why I’m writing this now. As someone who’s lived through the ups and downs, someone who’s seen friends and family in Thailand and elsewhere struggle with the same emotions during market dips, I can’t help but wonder why the cycle seems so hard to break. It’s almost like we’re all caught in the same pattern, as though we can’t help but fall prey to the same fears.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. If we can step back, if we can see the long-term picture and learn to control our emotions, then maybe, just maybe, we can break free from this cycle of buying high and selling low. The key is to understand that corrections are a natural part of the process, and that staying calm, staying patient, and looking at the bigger picture is the way forward. After all, whether you’re in Thailand or anywhere else, the principles of investing don’t change. It’s all about timing, patience, and understanding that the market will always have its ups and downs. You just have to ride it out and be ready to buy when others are selling.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

I’ve explored several popular websites, but most of them seem too AI-generated or focused on shilling.

What I’m looking for is something without opinions or price predictions—just bare facts, smth like ""X did/said Y... on..."".

To my surprise, finding such a source turned out to be far from trivial.

As I see it, this is the main issue with most crypto media today—they are largely shilling platforms.

What if there were a true crypto news outlet: one that focuses exclusively on reporting completed events and presenting the facts—no shilling, no predictions and other BS?

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Converting fchain.io XRP on LOBSTR to Native XRP?,2025-01-12 21:31:44,"
Newby here so please be gentle, I'm super naive to the working of crypto world and just trying to figure it out.

I have some XRP in a LOBSTR wallet but from what I gather this is not ""real"" Native XRP. It is a version pegged 1:1 to the Native XRP blockchain.

I'm guessing that means fchain.io actually holds the Native XRP and I only purchased the rights to it. If that makes sense. 

What does that mean when it comes to cashing out one day? Don't I have to have Native XRP to actually own and be able to sell the tokens?

Like all investors, I'm hoping to profit one day and want to make sure I have the right stuff.

Will sending my XRP to A cold wallet like Tangem convert fchain.io to native XRP?

I am probably over complicating this whole thing. Any help from folks with experience is really appreciated.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

I think one of the biggest challenge for traders is how unpredictable the market is, no matter how much research you do, sometimes there’s always an issue, sudden whale movements, or even a flash crash at 2 AM when you’re asleep.   
  
Personally my own issue has always been staying disciplined, when I do trade and I lose, I'm always doing revenge trades, or abandon a strategy halfway through.   
  
To fix this I used to do a lot of ""paper trading"" but I was very good at that, and I still fumble trades in real time.   
  
Although one thing that’s really helped me lately are trading events and competitions, I usually thought they were just gimmicks, but I joined one recently and it's been very helpful, at least with trading consistently, and because I'm not under pressure to make up for long periods of not trading, I usually do very well.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,I’m pretty sure Satoshi Nakamoto is Nick Szabo (it CANT be Len Sassaman tho),2025-01-12 22:38:07,"I’ve been thinking about this for so long my brain actually hurts but i just NEED to get this out there cuz no one is talkin about it the way they should be. like everyone’s all “ooh who is satoshi nakamoto” like its some big mystery but honestly bro if u just sit down and think about it for more than five seconds its SO OBVIOUS. like idk how ppl don’t see it cuz i’m just a normal guy not even that smart if i’m being honest (barely passed algebra lol) but even I can figure this out so what’s everyone else’s excuse. anyway what i’m sayin is its nick szabo, like 100%, no question in my mind, and it straight up CANNOT be len sassaman no matter what ppl say. lemme break it down for u in the simplest way possible (but also kinda long lol).

Ok so first of all if u don’t know who nick szabo is, then ur already kinda behind but don’t worry i gotchu. nick is like this super smart dude who basically INVENTED the idea of bitcoin before bitcoin was even a thing. he made something called “bit gold” which is like the grandpa of bitcoin if u think about it. like all the stuff that makes bitcoin work – the mining, the cryptography, the decentralization – all that stuff was in bit gold FIRST. and guess who made bit gold? nick. like HELLO how is this not the most obvious thing ever??? if u already invented something that’s basically bitcoin but older, then obviously ur the guy who’s gonna take it to the next level and make bitcoin. duh.

and here’s the thing: satoshi nakamoto didn’t just come out of nowhere. he (or she or they or w/e but i think it’s a he) had to be someone who already knew all this stuff about digital money and cryptography and all that nerdy math stuff. like ur not gonna wake up one day and invent bitcoin unless u already KNOW how all the pieces fit together. and nick szabo was working on this stuff for YEARS before bitcoin came out. YEARS, bro. like way back in the early 2000s or maybe even the 90s, idk, but it was a long time ago.

now lets talk about the writing. THIS is where it gets crazy cuz ppl have done like actual scientific studies or whatever on how satoshi writes and compared it to how nick writes, and guess what?? it’s basically the SAME. like, they both use super formal language and they spell stuff the british way (like “colour” and “favour” instead of “color” and “favor”). and they both use weird words like “computationally impractical” which i don’t even know what that means but apparently it’s a thing. and like who even talks like that except for nick and satoshi??? EXACTLY.

Also, nick is super private. like he doesn’t do interviews or talk about bitcoin at all, which is kinda sus if u ask me. like if u made bitcoin and ur NOT nick szabo, then u’d probably be out here tryna prove it, right? like “hey guys i’m satoshi nakamoto, give me a medal.” but nick? nope. he’s just chillin, keeping his head down, and NOT denying it. like ppl have asked him straight up “hey are u satoshi” and he never says no. he just kinda dodges the question. which is exactly what i’d do if i was satoshi and didn’t wanna get caught.

Oh and don’t even get me started on smart contracts. nick is like the OG when it comes to smart contracts. he’s been talking about this stuff FOREVER, way before anyone else even knew what a blockchain was. so it’s not just that he made bit gold, he also had all these ideas about how to make it better. like this dude was playing 4D chess while everyone else was still playing checkers

Now let’s talk about len sassaman cuz for some reason ppl think he’s satoshi and honestly i just don’t get it. like no offense to len (RIP, seems like a cool guy) but this theory makes ZERO sense if u actually think about it.

First off, len was more of a privacy guy, not a money guy. like he worked on stuff like remailers and encryption and all that, which is cool and super important, but that’s not bitcoin. bitcoin is about WAY more than just privacy. it’s about money and mining and decentralization and cryptography and a bunch of other stuff i don’t even understand, but nick does. len? not so much.

and the timing doesn’t make sense either. satoshi stopped posting in 2010, but len didn’t die until 2011. so what, he just decided to quit a year early for no reason? like, if i was satoshi and i knew i was dying, i’d probably stick around and finish what i started, not just disappear and leave everyone hanging. and then there’s this dumb theory that satoshi stopped as a “tribute” to len, but like… what??? that doesn’t even make sense. if u wanna honor someone, u keep working on their legacy, not just vanish into thin air.

oh and here’s the big one: len had NOTHING to do with bit gold. like i said before, bit gold is basically the blueprint for bitcoin, and nick made it. len wasn’t involved in that at all. so how’s he gonna go from working on privacy stuff to inventing bitcoin outta nowhere? nah man, that don’t add up.

And another thing, len’s writing style is totally different from satoshi’s. like i’m not an expert or anything, but even i can tell they don’t write the same way. satoshi writes super formal and technical, like he’s writing a textbook or something. len? not so much. if len was satoshi, he’d have to fake his whole writing style, and that just seems like way too much work.

ok so i just thought of something else while i was typing this. what if nick szabo WANTED ppl to think it was len sassaman?? like maybe that’s why he disappeared in 2010, so ppl would be like “oh it must be len, he died in 2011.” it’s like a smokescreen or whatever. idk, just a thought.

also, why does nobody ever talk about hal finney?? like i know ppl have said he might be satoshi too, but i don’t buy it. hal was involved in bitcoin early on, sure, but he didn’t invent it. he was more like the first guy to use it, not the guy who made it. and besides, hal and nick were friends or something, so maybe hal was just helping nick test it out.

anyway, that’s why i think nick szabo is DEFINITELY satoshi nakamoto and why it CAN’T be len sassaman. nick had the idea already with bit gold, he writes like satoshi, he’s private like satoshi, and he knows WAY more about this stuff than len ever did. len was a smart dude, no doubt, but bitcoin wasn’t his thing. it just doesn’t fit.

so yeah, that’s my theory. sorry if this was kinda long and rambling, but i had a lot to say lol. what do u guys think? am i onto something, or am i just overthinking this? let me know in the comments but don’t roast me too hard ok lol.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Why Nano is the Most Democratic and Inclusive Cryptocurrency,2025-01-12 19:11:39,"I wanted to share why I believe **Nano** stands out as the most democratic and inclusive option in the crypto space. Here are the key reasons:

**1. Open Representative Voting (ORV)**

Nano utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called **Open Representative Voting (ORV)**. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, ORV allows every Nano holder to choose a representative (or ""node"") that will help validate transactions on their behalf. Here’s why this is a game-changer:

* **Inclusivity:** Every holder, regardless of the amount they own, can participate in the network's governance by choosing a representative. This means even those with a small amount of Nano can have their voice heard by delegating their voting weight to a representative they trust to act in the network's best interest. While the weight of a vote is proportional to the amount of Nano delegated, the ability for anyone to participate, regardless of holdings, makes Nano far more inclusive than many other cryptocurrencies. Importantly, the combined voting weight of many small holders can have a significant impact on the network, giving them a powerful collective voice. This is a unique feature in the crypto world, as small holders in other systems often can't afford to buy mining equipment or lock up their funds in staking, effectively excluding them from meaningful participation.
* **Decentralization:** With thousands of potential representatives, the network remains highly decentralized, reducing the risk of central points of failure or control.

**2. Lightweight Node Requirements**

One of the major barriers to entry for many cryptocurrencies is the high cost and technical expertise required to run a full node. Nano addresses this by:

* **Low Resource Consumption:** Nano’s protocol is designed to be lightweight, meaning running a node doesn’t require expensive hardware or significant amounts of electricity. This makes it accessible to a much broader range of users.
* **Cost-Effective:** Since the barriers to running a node are minimal, more people can participate in maintaining the network, enhancing both its security and resilience.

**3. Financial Accessibility**

Nano is designed to be user-friendly and financially accessible:

* **No Staking Required:** Unlike PoS systems where users need to lock up their funds to participate in staking, Nano allows holders to engage in the network without risking their assets. This lowers the financial barrier and makes participation more inclusive.
* **No Mining Needed:** There’s no need to invest in costly mining equipment to validate transactions. This not only reduces the environmental impact but also ensures that validation power isn’t concentrated among those who can afford expensive hardware.

**4. Community-Driven Development**

Nano’s development is heavily influenced by its community. Regular updates, open discussions, and a strong focus on user feedback ensure that the network evolves in a way that benefits all participants, not just a select group.

**Conclusion**

In a world where many cryptocurrencies are moving towards centralization and exclusive participation, Nano stands out by prioritizing democracy and inclusivity. Its Open Representative Voting system and lightweight node requirements ensure that anyone, regardless of their financial status or technical expertise, can actively participate in and influence the network. If you’re looking for a cryptocurrency that truly embodies democratic principles and inclusivity, Nano is definitely worth considering!

What are your thoughts on Nano’s approach? Do you think it sets a new standard for democratic governance in the crypto space?",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Aggregated market analysis using steaks,2025-01-12 11:45:33,"with markets being boring as hell I’ve decided to share my aggregated market analysis I do each month. I love steaks, so I use a steak approach. If the steak is well-done, I’m heading out of the restaurant to spend my money elsewhere. If it’s medium I sit back and enjoy. If it’s rare I feast, and I spend.

I use a 10 grade steak-scale.

a 10/10 is a steak cooked so dry it crumbles, euw. Time to exit.

a 0/10 steak says moo, yum. let's eat.

Here’s the recipe:

# 1.

Grab 3-5 random trending news on google (regardless of sentiment) the past 4 weeks, and score them subjectively on an 10-grade scale based on:

**- Bullshittery**  
**- Bearish/bullish-ness**

**News 1: Meta urged to consider Bitcoin Treasury shareholder proposal:**  
Likely bullshit, but quite bullish  
Average score: 4/10, a medium rare steak. Good stuff.

**News 2: The U.S. Dollar Index at 2-year high:**  
No bullshit, and highly bearish  
Average score: 8/10, a well-done steak. euw.

**News 3: Institutional Bitcoin Holdings Surge to 31%:**  
Likely not bullshit, and highly bullish  
Average score: 3/10, a rare steak. Good stuff.

The steak for news is cooked to 5.0/10 - a half good steak. I’ll take it.

# 2.

Next I'll look at 3 of my favorite on-chain metrics to see what the underworld is up to.

I’ll grade these subjectively as well based on previous cycles ATH's.  
**- MVRZ:** 3/10, rare  
**- Puell:** 4/10, medium rare  
**- Reserve Risk:** rare, 3/10

The steak for on-chain is cooked to 3.3/10, medium rare -  a great steak!

# 3.

Finally I Iook at my most trusted steak-thermometer on steroids that taps into all of the above at once - the alphasquared bitcoin risk score.

**Alphasquared bitcoin risk**: 5.4/10. A medium steak. I'll have it.

# 4.

At last I combine them all to get my final filet:

(5.0+3.3+5.4)/3 = **4.57/10. A medium steak.**

I’ll sit back and enjoy it, like a steak I didn’t order but kinda want anyway. What other ingredients can Improve the recipe? Lmk.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Usdt much higher than USD price?,2025-01-12 12:24:16,"Hi, I'm new to cryptocurrency and I'm trying to understand the exchange rates.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,OriginTrail (Trac) P/E ratio is sitting at mere 17! ,2025-01-12 15:00:38,"First of all, this information is for people who actually understand value. I realize that most of you don't care nor seem to know what financial statements really say about a project/company. This information is targeted toward people who are looking at the fundamental value of a project and who are looking for projects that actually have tangible value now, and going forward!

With the latest upgrade of the DKG protocol, the increase in demand for Trac-token has now reached significant economic value. 

Regardless whether you are using fully diluted P/E or remove the 170 million of Trac tokens from the equation, since 70 million are sitting in TVL as nodes and staking, while 100 million are in the possession of the team to be spent to improve the protocol, the P/E Ratio here is **RIDICULOUSLY** low:

**Based on the latest increase in demand these are the numbers:**

**Token price**: $0,76

**Total number of Trac-tokens**: 500 million

**Total number of Trac in circulation**: 330 million

**Earnings Per Token, tokens in circulation**:  $14,592k / 330 million = 0,0442

**P/E Ratio, tokens in circulation**: $0,76 / 0,0442 = 17,19!

**P/E Ratio, fully diluted**: $0,76 / 0,0291 = 26,11

  
I'll just leave it at that.

Upon checking his Bittrex account it says 2.13113 Eth has been pending since a few months ago, but the history shows 2.13113 eth pow being sent around the same time. He didn't even have any Eth pow.

So he sent 2.13113 eth, which is still pending, and Bittrex sent Eth pow instead, which is only worth like 3 dollars a coin.

Did Bittrex just scam my friend? The contact page now leads to a 404 error, what can he do ? 😭

EDIT: People not believing it's real. He is / I'm not stupid. This genuinely happened. I've seen the screenshot where it shows the transaction history. I'm looking for advice on behalf of my friend.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,OriginTrail (Trac) - DKG v8 numbers WRAP UP - Demand skyrocketing - Impressive first 2 weeks!,2025-01-12 13:37:29,"For more info on the project and numbers, [see my earlier post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hxefp4/origintrail_trac_yoy_revenue_increase_since_2023/).

**To summaries, ELI5**:

there is no treasury, there's no token release, the fixed supply is 500 million tokens, TVL is 71 million Trac, all in circulation and all tokens being paid to nodes are acquired by business to be used as payment for knowledge assets.

**To the numbers**:

During the first 2 weeks of the newest release of the DKG v8, a whopping 800,000 Trac went to payment to nodes and astronomical 116,000,000 knowledge assets were published! In MERE 2 weeks!

Just take a good look at these numbers. While Litecoin recently celebrated ""unprecedented"" milestone of reaching 92 million transactions for the ENTIRE 2024, OriginTrails Decentralized Knowledge Graph has printed 110,000,000 knowledge assets in a mere 2 weeks. This is what happens when you spent years building a product that actually has real utility that businesses demand.

Here are the numbers since the v8 went live on Dec 27th 2024:

**Dec 28th - Jan 3rd**:

Trac paid to nodes: 349,000

Knowledge Assets published: 51,320,000

**Jan 4th - Jan. 10th**:

Trac paid to nodes: 453,000

Knowledge Asets published: 64,870,000

Note that there are only 71 nodes running on the DKG, across 3 different chains. Most all of these knowledge assets are being published on the OriginTrails own parachain NeuroWeb. NeuroWeb on the other hand only has 22 nodes, of which only 6 are maxed out with 2,000,000 Trac and cannot be staked on unless someone removes their tokens. 4 nodes are above 1 million and can accept staking. That means that currently, pretty much ALL knowledge assets that are being published are going to these 10 nodes and these are the nodes currently that are getting all the payments. The APY here is through the roof.

**To finalize**:

Price per token: $0,76

Market cap full circulation: $384 million

Ranking: 175

**Fully diluted P/E Ratio: 19,79!!! (This has to be the lowest P/E in crypto!)**

Let's see how long this can last!

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Has anyone invested in crypto domain names?,2025-01-12 00:46:42,"I bought a few back in 2019 - sold a handful since then with the best return being from a LTC mining related .org that I sold for 0.3 BTC. I own a split of self-registered domains and those I've bought off the secondary market. I like .org names and I think there is a trend that they overperform in the crypto domain market (not hugely surprising as it fits the decentralization theme) but .com will always demand the highest values I think.

I bought up a series of domains containing Buy, Sell, Trade, Wallet, Mine/Miners combined with a range of cryptos and dropped those that dropped off the market to keep renewal fees down but given the value of sales this is purely from an efficiency perspective and not a necessity. I also bought Eliminates .COM with the idea of a crypto website dedicated to the move away from fiat currency but never got round to it.

Can't store your private keys on your phone. It's a piece of paper people often keep it where it's safest (their homes). Aside from breaking ins and theft, fire hazard is the biggest risk.

Well, unless you have one of these metallic private keys but I think not everyone has them.

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

Reddit,crypto,The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,2024-12-26 15:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

I asked a busy researcher how to determine if a value before exponentiation is suitable for Miller/pairing inversion and here’s his answer

> Suppose the elliptic curve is defined over F_p,
the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Reddit,crypto,Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2024-12-13 10:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

Reddit,crypto,Attack on 16-round DES,2024-12-04 10:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Reddit,crypto,Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,2024-12-03 17:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286

I got the key length of 3 and used it to decrypt the text. Since it was not a meaningful text, I understand that I the correct key length if different.

Could you please advise what I did wrong? I think something is not correct with the function find\_keysize(text, keysize\_list) but don't what. I take 4 chunks and go through all 6 pairs. Then I normalize all hamming distances by the keysize, and finally I divide total distance by 6 to find the average.",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286
Reddit,crypto,Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,2024-10-17 05:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)).",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286
Reddit,crypto,The quantum computing revolution nobody is talking about.....,2024-10-16 17:18:03,"This is probably more significant than any of these papers coming out of China claiming to break RSA or Gift 64 using a western quantum computer. Scott Aaronson, the consummate quantum pessimist has rather abruptly changed his mind. The man who is famous for debunking claims related to quantum capabilities says: 

To any of you who are worried about post-quantum cryptography—by now I’m so used to delivering a message of, *maybe, eventually,* someone will need to *start thinking about* migrating from RSA and Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve crypto to lattice-based crypto, or other systems that could plausibly withstand quantum attack. I think today that message needs to change. I think today the message needs to be: yes, unequivocally, worry about this now. Have a plan.

Given SHA256 is supposed to be random and well distributed, is it true to say that essentially each output can have an infinite and relatively equal number of collisions generated by infinite inputs.

i.e. given in reality we have infinite inputs to feed the function (think arbitrary long binary numbers), can we assume that a properly functioning hash function has ""even and reachable"" collisions across it's output space?

Also, how can we gain confidence that a specific hash function is random and evenly distributed?",2025-01-13 00:56:24.473286
