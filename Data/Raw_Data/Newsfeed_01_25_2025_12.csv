This prolonged dip below a key psychological level has left analysts and investors divided as uncertainty continues to dominate the broader crypto market. While some see signs of potential recovery, others remain cautious about the short-term outlook. Related Reading: XRP Forms A Bullish Pattern In 4-Hour Chart – Analyst Expects $4.20 After Breakout Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided some clarity by sharing a detailed technical analysis. According to Martinez, Cardano is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, a structure often associated with impending volatility and significant price movements. The outcome of this pattern could determine Cardano’s next major trend, whether bullish or bearish. As the market sentiment remains fragile, ADA’s ability to break out of this consolidation phase will likely set the tone for its performance in the coming days. A decisive move could either spark renewed optimism among investors or reinforce concerns about further downside.  Cardano approaches a critical juncture, with traders and investors eagerly awaiting confirmation of its next move. The resolution of this symmetrical triangle could prove pivotal for ADA’s trajectory in the volatile crypto landscape. Cardano Prepares For A Big Move Cardano (ADA) has been heavily influenced by market volatility as the broader crypto market remains in a consolidation phase since late December. This prolonged period of sideways movement has kept traders and investors on edge, with many anticipating a significant breakout. However, the question remains: will Cardano’s next move be bullish or bearish? Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided insights into Cardano’s current setup, sharing a detailed technical analysis on X. According to Martinez, ADA is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic chart structure that often precedes a major price move. The setup suggests that once the pattern resolves, Cardano could experience a 40% price swing in either direction. If ADA breaks out to the upside and confirms the move with strong volume, it could trigger a massive rally, potentially taking the price toward new short-term highs. Such a move would likely reinvigorate market sentiment and attract fresh buying interest. On the other hand, if Cardano fails to hold critical demand levels, a breakdown could result in a significant decline, leading to extended bearish pressure. Related Reading: Hedera Successfully Retests Key Demand Level – Expert Says The Next Stop Could Be $0.52 The coming days will be crucial for Cardano as it tests these critical levels. Traders are closely watching for confirmation of the breakout direction, as the outcome could set the stage for ADA’s trajectory in the weeks ahead. Whether the symmetrical triangle leads to a bullish rally or a bearish correction, the resolution of this consolidation phase will undoubtedly have a major impact on Cardano’s future performance in the crypto market. Price Struggles Below $1 Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.98, struggling to regain momentum after several days of being unable to break back above the crucial $1 mark. This psychological level has proven to be a significant barrier, and reclaiming it as support is essential for bulls to regain control of the price action. For ADA to shift into a more bullish trajectory, it needs to break above $1 and hold it firmly as support. Such a move would signal renewed buying interest and could set the stage for further upward momentum. In the short term, the next target for ADA would be the $1.05 level. A breakout above this resistance could trigger a significant rally, potentially reigniting optimism among investors. However, the downside risks remain. If ADA loses the $0.95 support level, it could face a deeper correction phase, as this would signal increased selling pressure. Such a move might lead to further bearish sentiment, challenging the broader market’s stability.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin’s Latest ATH: Is The Top Finally In Or Just Getting Started?,2025-01-25 10:00:04+00:00,"In the past months, Bitcoin has broken multiple resistance levels to achieve consistent all-time highs each month. So far, the asset’s latest all-time high sits above $109,000 marking a more than 150% increase in year-over-year performance. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst Gaah has recently examined Bitcoin’s current position in the market cycle and whether the asset might be nearing a peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Drops 93% From December Peak – What’s Next For BTC? Bitcoin: Is The Top In? According to Gaah’s analysis, the Index of Bitcoin Cycle Indicators (IBCI)—a composite metric that includes on-chain data points like the Puell Multiple, MVRV, NUPL, and SOPR—has entered the “distribution region” for the first time in eight months. While this doesn’t “yet confirm a market top,” it serves as a cautionary signal that Bitcoin could be approaching the final stages of its current bull cycle. For IBCI to hit a definitive top, all its components would need to reach their historical peak levels, according to the analyst. However, as long as the IBCI remains above 50%, the broader market trend remains bullish, indicating continued demand and the potential for further price increases. Beyond the IBCI, Gaah notes that additional on-chain indicators present a mixed picture. While the NUPL metric hovers near its upper range, suggesting a possible end to the bull run, the Puell Multiple remains closer to the lower zone, which could indicate room for continued growth. This interplay of signals suggests that the market may not have reached a definitive top just yet. According to Gaah, historically, a fully realized IBCI peak has preceded corrections and longer-term bear phases. However, the current position offers room for optimism, provided that demand remains strong and other indicators remain supportive. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capital Inflows See Notable Slowdown, But Is This A Worry? Another Diverging Interpretation In contrast to Gaah’s cautious perspective, another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, highlights a different scenario using the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. This metric, designed to spot local tops and bottoms, recently fell to its lowest point in 60 days, signaling a potential “local bottom.” Kesmeci explains that historically when the NVT Golden Cross drops below -1.6, it often indicates that the asset is trading within a bottom range. As Bitcoin recently pulled back by about 7.5% after reaching its all-time high, the metric’s current reading could be a precursor to renewed upward momentum. Kesmeci wrote: Rather than indicating a specific price level, this metric suggests that Bitcoin may be trading within a local bottom zone. Historically, such signals have often preceded recovery and trend reversals, making it an important indicator to monitor.

Some analysts suggest that the new crypto-friendly administration could propel the token’s price to a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: $30 Million Hack Alert? Crypto Exchange Phemex Suspends Withdrawals After Suspicious Transactions ONDO Targets Rally To New ATH On Friday, tokenized real-world asset (RWA) platform Ondo Finance saw its native token lead the crypto market with its 11% daily surge. The cryptocurrency surged past the $1.50 mark for the second time this week, reigniting investors’ sentiment about the token. Over the past three months, the token has registered a 120% jump, climbing from the $0.60 mark to its current price range. Moreover, the post-election rally propelled the cryptocurrency to its latest ATH of $2.14, fueled by Donald Trump’s DeFi project’s buying spree. In December, Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) went on a crypto buying spree worth $45 million, acquiring millions in Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and other tokens. Halfway through the month, WLF purchased 134,216 ONDO tokens for 250,000 USDC, propelling ONDO’s price above the $2 mark. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum was halted after the December 19 market correction, which saw ONDO retrace to $1 in the following days. Since then, ONDO has been unable to reclaim the $1.60 resistance level, hovering between the $1.09 and $1.45 price range for most of the month. Crypto trader Miky Bull noted the token’s bullish performance as it attempted to break out from its downtrend today. The crypto has been in a one-month downtrend since hitting its latest ATH, with an attempted breakout at the start of the year. Today, the token is attempting another breakout, currently holding above the downtrend line. Per the post, the “king of RWA”’s breakout could target the $2-$3 price range. However, the cryptocurrency needs to remain above the $1.30 level to confirm the break. Additionally, ONDO should hold near the $1.50 mark to continue its bullish trajectory toward the $1.60 resistance. New Pro-Crypto Administration To Fuel American Tokens? Market watcher Detoshi pointed out that ONDO has recovered a key level after its recent performance, which could support a rally toward a new ATH. According to the post, the token has reclaimed its previous ATH level, which was a crucial resistance before the December pump and significant support during the smaller market corrections. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa also highlighted ONDO’s performance, stating that the cryptocurrency’s chart is “looking strong,” adding that it was a “good beneficiary of a pro-crypto administration.” Similarly, Analyst Ted Pillows suggested that investors should “keep an eye on Trump and his wallet,” which includes ONDO, as these tokens are expected to perform well during the next leg up.

This category includes ONDO, TRUMP, SUI, and other big players like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP. Crypto leaders and investors anticipate that these tokens might be the “next big narrative,” fueled by the new US industry-friendly government and the expected end of the “regulation by enforcement” approach led by the previous administration. As of this writing, ONDO trades at $1.51, a 20% increase in the weekly timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Mayer Multiple Reveals When BTC Will Become ‘Overbought’",2025-01-25 07:00:51+00:00,"Bitcoin has still not become overbought according to the Mayer Multiple. Here’s the level BTC would need to breech in order to enter this territory. Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Has A Value Of 1.37 Right Now In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the Mayer Multiple for Bitcoin. The “Mayer Multiple” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between BTC’s spot price and its 200-day moving average (MA). As Glassnode explains, The 200DMA is a widely recognized tool for gauging macro bull or bear bias. The Mayer Multiple measures how far BTC is from this long-term average. When the Mayer Multiple has a value greater than 1, it means the price of the cryptocurrency is trading above its 200-day MA. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies the asset is below this historically important level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shark Wallets Set New Record: Bullish Foreshadowing For 2025? Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple over the last few years: Looks like the Mayer Multiple is greater than 1 right now | Source: Glassnode on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple has a value of 1.37 right now, which means that the asset has a notable distance over its 200-day MA. In the chart, Glassnode has also highlighted three lines where the spot price of BTC would assume a Mayer Multiple equal to a historically relevant value. The green level (bottom) corresponds to the indicator assuming a value of 0.8. BTC being under this level has generally signaled oversold conditions. The line is currently situated around $60,000, meaning that the asset would have to drop under this mark to arrive at the bottoming zone. The red level (top) is located at $181,000 right now. At this price mark, the cryptocurrency’s Mayer Multiple would reach a value of 2.4. Going beyond this level usually implies that the asset is becoming overbought. “Although BTC is above its 200DMA, it’s quite far from the overbought territory,” notes the analytics firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Hits 60-Day Low: Is This Bullish? Bitcoin would have to break the $181,000 level if it has to cross above this level in the current cycle. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the asset would breach the level in this cycle at all or if it would top out before it can happen. The last line in the graph, the blue one in the middle, is just the 200-day MA of the asset. That is, the line where the Mayer Multiple is exactly equal to 1. BTC dipped under this level for a while during the consolidation period last year. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $106,600, up almost 2% in the last seven days.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory, Is This Good Or Bad For Price?",2025-01-25 05:30:02+00:00,"In a recent development, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin long-term holders have officially entered greed territory. This could benefit the price in the short term, although the long-term consequences could be severe. The greed phase suggests that long-term Bitcoin holders are now excessively optimistic about BTC’s future trajectory. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory In an X post, Martinez stated that long-term Bitcoin holders, having experienced every phase of the market cycle, are now letting greed take over. In terms of market sentiment, these holders have moved from capitulation to hope, optimism, and then belief and are now in the greed phase. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here’s What’s Supposed To Happen Next This excessive optimism typically leads these investors to accumulate more BTC impulsively without considering rational analyses. In the short term, this greed phase is bullish for the Bitcoin price since this market sentiment could spark more buying pressure and drive the flagship crypto higher. This buying pressure for Bitcoin already looks to be evident as on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the number of wallets holding 100 to 1,000 BTC has broken an all-time high (ATH), rising to 15,777 wallets. The platform also mentioned that Bitcoin whales peaked up steam this week with the US inauguration and a new BTC ATH as transactions exceeding $100,00 surged to their highest level in six weeks.  This greed phase is good for the BTC price, as it could continue to send the flagship crypto to new highs. However, in the long term, this excessive optimism could put BTC in overbought territory, eventually sparking a massive wave of sell-offs that would send the Bitcoin price tumbling.  This greed phase among Bitcoin long-term holders looks to be sparked by optimism around Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration and the strategic BTC reserve especially. This still poses a risk for the Bitcoin price since the flagship crypto could be trading well above its actual value if the BTC reserve isn’t eventually created.  What Needs To Happen For BTC To Stay Bullish In another X post, Ali Martinez warned that the Bitcoin price needs to stay above $97,530 to remain bullish. According to him, this price level is the key support level to watch for BTC, as holding above it is crucial to maintaining the current bullish momentum. Bitcoin is currently consolidating around this range after hitting a new ATH of $109,000 earlier this week.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Meanwhile, crypto analyst Crypto Rover highlighted the $102,000 support area as the most important for the BTC price right now.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Inauguration Effect? Bitcoin Whales Start Accumulating As Trump Era Begins,2025-01-25 03:30:29+00:00,"Following Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th, Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound, trading between $101,000 to $110,000. However, a new report by CryptoQuant states that behind this routine price action, Bitcoin ‘whales’ are quietly back to accumulating the premier cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Whales Back In Accumulation Mode According to the report, large BTC holders – commonly referred to as Bitcoin ‘whales’ – have re-entered the accumulation phase. Recent data shows a significant uptick in the monthly percentage growth of BTC holdings among these large investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast Of $150,000 ‘Too Low’ Amid Rising Adoption, Crypto Trader Says Notably, Bitcoin whale holdings increased from a decline of -0.25% on January 14 to a growth of 2% by January 17, marking the highest monthly growth rate since mid-December. In absolute terms, these investors’ BTC holdings rose from 16.2 million on November 4 to 16.4 million as of January 24. The surge in whale accumulation appears to be driven by several bullish developments early in Trump’s administration. For example, the US president has already signed an executive order establishing a Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. This Working Group has been tasked with proposing a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies – including stablecoins – within six months. Additionally, the group will evaluate the potential creation of a national digital asset stockpile, fueling speculation about a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Besides growth in whale holdings, selling pressure for BTC has declined sharply since major profit-taking in December. This aligns with a recent report which found that BTC profit-taking has dropped by 93% from its December peak. The report reads: Bitcoin holders realized daily profits as high as $10 billion as Bitcoin approached $100K in December. However, daily realized profits have fallen to levels around $2-$3 billion in January, which indicates market participants may have finished selling Bitcoin for the most part. Moreover, the traders’ unrealized profit margins have declined near zero, a level which typically marks a price floor during bull markets. However, the report also highlights that overall Bitcoin spot demand has weakened over the past month, raising concerns about the likelihood of another bullish rally. Specifically, the rate of demand growth for Bitcoin has fallen from 279,000 BTC in early December to just 75,000 BTC at the time of writing. Analysts Confident Of Another BTC Rally Despite the cooling of on-chain demand, crypto analysts remain optimistic about another major price rally for Bitcoin. For instance, a recent report suggested that BTC could target a price as high as $249,000 during Trump’s presidency. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Hit Its Peak In Summer 2025? Analysts Weigh In Another report by Bitfinex predicted that BTC is likely headed to $200,000 by mid-year amid mild price pullbacks. However, a lot depends on how the US Federal Reserve handles interest rate adjustments this year. From a technical standpoint, BTC’s cup-and-handle pattern projects a price target of as high as $275,000. At press time, BTC trades at $106,074, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Sun’s strategy hinges on a radical overhaul of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) and the Ethereum protocol itself.  Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve: Eric Trump’s Deleted Tweet Raises Eyebrows The TRON founder asserts that under his leadership, immediate and decisive actions could almost double the current price peak for ETH. One of his primary proposals is to halt the sale of ETH for a minimum of three years. By doing so, Sun aims to stabilize the currency’s supply and bolster market confidence.  To cover operational costs during this period, Sun suggests leveraging Aave (AAVE) lending, staking yields, and stablecoin borrowing, thereby ensuring that the ETH supply remains intact while aligning with deflationary goals. In addition to halting sales, Sun proposes imposing significant taxes on Layer 2 (L2) projects. He believes this move could generate at least $5 billion annually for Ethereum, either in stablecoins or tokens.  The revenue from these taxes would be utilized to repurchase and burn ETH in a decentralized manner, further enhancing scarcity and potentially driving up demand. Major Staff Cuts To Transform Ethereum Foundation Into Meritocracy In his social media post, Sun also emphasized the need to streamline operations within the Ethereum Foundation. He suggests a significant reduction in staff, retaining only the most capable team members.  Those who remain would receive substantial salary increases, transitioning the Ethereum Foundation into a merit-based organization that rewards high performance. Furthermore, the TRON founder calls for adjustments in node rewards and a stronger focus on fee-burning mechanisms. By reducing node rewards, Sun believes Ethereum can solidify its deflationary status, reinforcing its position as a store of value.  Related Reading: Cardano Will Reach $1.50 Once The $1.10 Resistance Breaks – Details The focus, according to Sun, would shift exclusively toward Layer 1 (L1) development, prioritizing scalability, security, and broader adoption. Sun is confident that these initiatives could lead the Ethereum price to surpass $4,500 within the first week of implementation, laying the groundwork for long-term success.  While this only represents Sun’s vision for the Ethereum price, any of these proposals, if viable for driving another leg up of the altcoin, could ultimately be adopted by the co-founders or the developers of the platform. As of this writing, the Ethereum price hovers around the $3,200 mark, reflecting a loss of 4% over the past 24 hours. This decline has widened the gap between the current price and its ATH of $4,878, representing a difference of 34.5%.

The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the amount of BTC wallets that belong to a particular group. Addresses or investors are categorized into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. For example, wallets holding 5 tokens are put into the 1 to 10 coins group. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Hits 60-Day Low: Is This Bullish? In the context of the current topic, the wallet range of interest is 100 to 1,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of the range converts to $10.5 million and the upper one to $105 million. Thus, the only addresses that would qualify for the cohort would be the ones belonging to the large traders. This group is popularly known as the sharks. The sharks are certainly not the largest entities on the network—that title belongs to the whales—but they are still influential due to their notable holdings. Below is the chart for the Bitcoin Supply Distribution shared by the analytics firm, which shows the data for these key investors over the last few months. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution for the 100 to 1,000 coins group saw a sharp upwards trajectory during the last few weeks of 2024, implying a large amount of new shark-sized investors popped up on the network. The growth in the indicator has significantly slowed down this year, but it has nonetheless continued as the metric’s value has just set a new record of 15,777 addresses. Bitcoin has seen a pause in its bull run recently, so to see the sharks still be interested in buying the asset could naturally be a positive sign for things to come in the near future. The sharks haven’t been the only investors accumulating recently, as the analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out that the shrimps and crabs have also been seeing positive flows. The shrimps and crabs refer to the Bitcoin investors owning up to 1 and 10 BTC, respectively. As is apparent from the chart, these small entities have combined bought 25,600 BTC during the past month, which is equivalent to 1.9x the Monthly Issuance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capital Inflows See Notable Slowdown, But Is This A Worry? The Monthly Issuance is the amount that miners have produced/mined over the last 30 days. Thus, it would appear that the retail investors have been absorbing almost twice as much supply as the miners have been minting. BTC Price Bitcoin has been moving sideways over the last few days as its price is still floating around the $105,100 level.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,"Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With Rising Channel Pattern",2025-01-25 00:00:01+00:00,"Crypto analyst BasicTrading has revealed a bullish pattern that has appeared for the Ethereum price, which hints at a rally to $4,000. This again provides some optimism concerning ETH, which has continued to underperform in this market cycle.  Ethereum Price Eyes $4,000 With This Bullish Pattern In a TradingView post, BasicTrading revealed that a breakout to $4,000 looks to be on the horizon for the Ethereum price following the formation of a rising channel pattern. This bullish prediction came as the analyst noted that ETH had been retesting the previous all-time high resistance and was not able to break it.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 However, this time, it could be different following the rising channel pattern. The analyst added that with the bullish break and retest and Ethereum price action, the breakout is about to happen. With Ethereum likely to break this psychological $4,000 resistance level soon enough, the analyst suggested that this could ultimately pave the way for ETH to reach and possibly surpass its current ATH of $4,800. BasicTrading remarked that the sky is the limit for the Ethereum price if it manages to break above its current ATH. Interestingly, the crypto analyst raised the possibility of ETH rising to between $20,000 and $25,000 if it replicates its historical performance from previous bull cycles. This price range represents the upper resistance trendline of the rising channel.  However, the analyst stated that the Ethereum price must first achieve a clear breakout of its current ATH before a rally to as high as $25,000 can become a possibility. This bullish projection for ETH comes just days after crypto analyst Ali Martinez explained why it wasn’t time to give up on Ethereum despite its underperformance in this market cycle. Martinez mentioned that a decisive breakout above $4,000 could send ETH to $7,000.  ETH To Reach Five Digits In This Bull Run Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has also backed BasicTrading’s bullish outlook as he predicted that the Ethereum price would at least reach $10,000 in this market cycle. The analyst asserted that ETH will come back with a “vengeance” in the coming months. He added that $10,000 is the bare minimum once Ethereum breaks out. CrediBULL Crypto further opined that $20,000 is certainly not unreasonable by the end of this cycle.  Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, stating that ETH’s hated rally that will bring it to $12,000 is loading. He further remarked that the chart is giving market participants a glimpse and that patience is all it takes.  At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,400, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,CoinShares Seeks Approval For Spot Litecoin And XRP ETF In Latest Market Move,2025-01-24 22:56:57+00:00,"In a notable change in the crypto regulatory environment, asset managers are regaining confidence in their pursuit of ETFs. Significantly, CoinShares submitted applications for a spot XRP ETF and a Litecoin (LTC) fund, indicating an increasing enthusiasm for altcoin investment offerings. CoinShares Targets Litecoin And XRP ETF CoinShares’ submission arises as the US ETF market is progressively concentrating on cryptocurrency investments, after the approval and resulting success of funds investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2024. The firm has submitted an S-1 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the XRP ETF, aimed at providing investors with direct exposure to the market’s second largest altcoin.  Related Reading: SAB 122 Is A Bigger Bitcoin Price Catalyst Than The US BTC Reserve Additionally, CoinShares is expanding its offerings by applying for a spot Litecoin ETF, positioning itself as one of the few companies actively exploring altcoin-based ETFs in the US market. On the same day, Grayscale Investments also filed applications with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for both a Solana ETF and a Litecoin ETF, alingning with other firms, including Canary Capital and CoinShares, all seeking regulatory approval for similar products. Skepticism Surrounds Proposed Litecoin ETF Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the XRP ETF filing, the altcoin has shown a mixed response in the market. XRP recently emerged from a nearly three-year consolidation period below the $0.50 mark, boosted by excitement surrounding pro-crypto regulatory shifts under President Donald Trump.  Currently, XRP is experiencing remarkable momentum, boasting a staggering 500% year-to-date gain, trading at approximately $3.10. However, the announcement of CoinShares’ XRP ETF did not significantly impact the token’s price, which remains down 0.4% within a 24-hour period.  Related Reading: XRP Long Term Potential Remains Extremely Bullish Possibility Of Price At $20 On a more critical note, the proposed Litecoin ETF has sparked skepticism among some market experts. Analyst Ali Martinez expressed concerns regarding the viability of a Litecoin ETF, pointing out that the coin has remained stuck in the same price range since 2017, a span of eight years.  The analyst continued to probe the reasoning for initiating a Litecoin ETF when ironic options, like a “USDT ETF,” he claims, might provide more instant advantages such as staking rewards.

Reddit,solana,Wallet got drained through Telegram scam,2025-01-24 19:40:58,"DONT FALL FOR THE SCAM. If you check my post history I posted asking for help understanding what happened with my trades. Now I’m posting again to warn everyone of a scam. I’m going to try to explain to the best of my ability.

 For reference I’m usually good at scanning for scams. Although at this moment my emotions got the best of me and blinded my intuition. A redditor replied to me telling me to join a subreddit r / Whales On Sol that claimed to have explained my problem, I went to join the TG “for more information” and a was required to sign into my TG for the safeguard bot. They then proceeded to log into my account (which I wasn’t notified of) got my complaint to Bullx ticket number and contacted me again through another account claiming to be a “help representative”.

This is again, where I didn’t listen to my intuition (as I found it very suspicious that he needed my 2fa code to prove that I was the owner of the account) but I gave it to anyways because he had my ticket number and i wasn’t notified of the sign in on TG. There was no other way for them to know the ticket number. A couple of seconds after sending it, I realized what had happened and instantly went to my account to send the Sol to a different wallet, but the damage was already done. He had completely drained my account. 

I fully understand that is my fault. Sorry for the rambling, I’m emotional right now, it wasn’t my life savings so I’ll be ok. I’m not asking for pity or help. This is a learning moment for me and I hope this post can help those who are also new to the crypto space to be wary of scammers. I’m absolutely done with trading meme coins and shit coins. I wish you guys all the best, I’m just not cut out for this.

Reddit,solana,STRENGTHENING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY,2025-01-25 00:08:34,"We’re not even a full week into the new administration, and we’re already getting great news for the future of the Crypto industry. On Thursday night, President Trump signed an executive order to promote the growth of crypto in the U.S. and work towards developing a national digital asset stockpile. 

Here’s what you need to know:
The order emphasizes the importance of supporting the growth of legitimate, dollar-backed stablecoins globally to strengthen the U.S. dollar. 
It also creates a new working group to consider the requirements and implications of a national digital asset stockpile, “potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.”
It outlines key protections for individuals and companies that use blockchain networks, as well as the developers and miners securing these networks.
It prohibits creating a “central bank digital currency,” a type of cryptocurrency overseen by the government that many crypto enthusiasts believe contradicts industry ideology. 
The order promises “fair and open access to banking services” for crypto companies, a response to complaints from these companies that banks are denying them accounts. (Shortly after the order was issued, the SEC rolled back accounting guidance that previously deterred banks from working with crypto companies). 

You can read more about the order:

>**1/4** Real Assets. Real Yield. Coming to Solana.  
  
Plume's SkyLink unlocks yields from Real World Assets (RWAs) direct to [@solana](https://x.com/solana).  
  
No bridging, no multiple wallets - omnichain yields will stream directly into your Solana wallet.  
  
 Why this matters...

SkyLink is built using [@LayerZero\_Core](https://x.com/LayerZero_Core) for fast, seamless, and secure cross-chain functionality.



>**3/4** This expansion comes as RWAs hit $17B in total onchain value.  
  
While traditional markets hold over $100T in tokenization potential, the ability to distribute yields across blockchain ecosystems has remained fragmented - until now.

My twitter has about 2.4k followers and I have had this kinda crappy website for a bit (tho have made me some couple hundreds of bucks in the last two years).

Now, people have a massive engagement through all my platforms, specially Facebook where I also have the monetization on. So I have been thinking get serious about it, I wanna create a completely massive and ambition app amount others serious projects and I want to make a token in Solana to use it as currency for selling custom products in the app and to use it as donations that people can do and we can send it to help in case of hurricane or any other disaster, amount other different use.

I have seen some tutorials how to do the coin but I don’t have enough knowledge to do this. I have a lot of doubts and question that need to be clear out before I proceed to do this.

I was thinking if any of you with more experience can help me. Should I create the token now and keep it in my wallet making air drops and using it as reward for people that interact with my page/app (when is done) and after a few month or a year put it in the market or make a pre sale so I can have a lot of holders when release? Or should I put it in the market right now and collect capital to do marketing, pay for app development and other things? I don’t really know what the best way to proceed.

There is a lot to take into consideration. Also I’m scared about the snipers that steal my liquidity if I release it now because I don’t have a lot of capital to make the liquidity pool as big as I want to.

Help me out guys if you have any answers. And please suggest me any modifications of this post so I can be more clear and suggest me other communities that you think could help me so I can cross post.

Reddit,solana,How to Keep Your Funds Safu on Solana,2025-01-24 12:36:44,"Solana is great, but like any crypto space, scammers are everywhere. I noticed there has been a great influx of new members to the community. So if your new (or even if you are not), here is what you should do to protect yourself.

# 1. Use a Hardware Wallet

If you have a lot of SOL or valuable NFTs, dont just leave them sitting in a hot wallet. Get a Ledger or Trezor and store them offline. This will improve your sleep.

Also, do NOT connect your hardware wallet to random dApps unless you are very sure it is safe.

# 2. Be Careful with Approvals

Every time you connect your wallet to a new site, you are giving them permissions. Before approving anything, read what it is asking for.

* If it asks for **""unlimited spending""**, think twice.
* If its a brand-new project, use a **separate burner wallet** instead.

# 3. Watch Out for Scams

Some of the most common scams:

* **Fake airdrops** – If something suddenly appears in your wallet and asks you to ""claim"" it, ignore it.
* **Fake mint sites** – Always get mint links from official Twitter/Discord accounts.
* **Impersonators**  \- “Hello sir, I’m support.” **No, you are a scammer.**

# 4. Remove Unused Permissions

Go to [solscan.io](http://solscan.io) and check which dApps have access to your wallet. If you do not use something anymore, remove its permissions. Phantom also has a setting for this.

# 5. Use a Burner Wallet for Risky Stuff

If you are minting NFTs or testing new DeFi platforms, use a **separate wallet** with a small balance. If something goes wrong, your main funds stay safe.

If you have been in Solana for a while, what is the best security tip you learned? Or what is the worst scam you seen?",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

I am locking for something that will show me a step by step list of the involved actions and the accounts who did the actions, like

* minting
* creation of a liquidity pool
* who supplied the liquidity
* then the transaction/transfers
* when the liquidity was removed and who it was transferred to

For each step, when possible, I also want to see how the value of the token has changed. 

I realize that you can scan very deep into the transactions. I would like to see a level that would help me understand the lifecycle process with actual data. I realize that where the money came from and where it was sent can likely be a complex network. That is not what I want to see (yet).

Reddit,solana,"Neobullx users help, account funds drained",2025-01-24 06:04:53,"Hey

Joined neo.bullx a little over 3 weeks ago. Setup my wallet with my private key. Saved that private key to a seperare hard drive in a notepad file.

Only used that key 1 singular time. (Directly through the official Nova bot telegram channel.) To connect my wallet on neo.bullx to Nova.

That is the only time ive used that private key.

Went to login to my wallet yesterday and noticed my entire account was drained. Someone transferred all my 3.5 sol to another wallet. 

Added 2fa on my account, logged out of my account across all devices. Neo.bullx is weird since it logs you in through telegram. And you can only have 1 telegram account for 1 phone number. So it appears I'm stuck with one account for Neo.bullx.

Steps i've taken
- Archived old wallets on Neo.bullx (can't delete primary one for some reason.)
- Added 2fa on bullx & logged out of all devices several times
- Created a brand new email/phantom wallet (used a really strong generated password, each unique.) 
- Added way more 2fa/security updates to telegram/phantom/email account.

Completely factory reset my pc (deleted everything including personal files. If there was somehow a keylogger.

I've changed the old email password/authentication methods as well. 

So considering ive updated Neobullx 2fa and created a brand new phantom wallet under a brand new email (both with unique passwords and heavy authentications.) Do you think its safe to link this new phantom wallet to that neobullx account that had the funds stolen?

What are good options? Should I just switch platforms entirely?

I'm also very careful with clicking external links for scams/phishing

Reddit,solana,What happens when a coin graduates in Pumpfun.,2025-01-24 05:32:42,"Greetings to all, such as the title suggests, I want to know the wereabouts of the meme coin once it graduates.  If one can keep selling or buying from Pumpfun or I must move to another site,

I ask this, since I am interested in making my first memecoin inside that platform, but from what I´ve seen it is very likely to fall on rugpulls and stuff. I have already fallen twice, for a rugpull and that made me realize the volatility of the site as a whole, nevertheless I am quite ignorant on the coding necessary to build a coin of such likes. So I considered that such web is the most ideal one.

Reddit,solana,General feasibility question for smart contracts.,2025-01-24 01:10:16,"I'm new to programming and blockchain, learning as i go. Recently launched a token on the solana network (trading on raydium), and was wondering if it would be possible to write a smart contract that would capture a very small percentage of the transaction fees associated with this token and direct them to charity wallet. For example if the token governance was operated through DAO and the charity wallet was controlled by the DAO perhaps with a multisig wallet.  Before I go too far down this rabbit hole, would this even be possible? Thanks for any and all input.

EDIT 1/25/25

I’m trying to develop this project into something that can be used for charitable causes.  Another idea I have is to keep a certain amount in a treasury wallet that is controlled by the DAO and is used for a liquidity pool, and the proceeds from that directed into the charity wallet.  

The insanity that has been going on in the meme coin space has to stop.  So many scams and rug pulls (always been an issue but exponentially more lately i feel).  I think meme coins are about building a community, and can be powerful tools, but only if there’s trust.  

I’m open to any and all suggestions and really appreciate everyone’s input.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Now i want to tell you that i always make this mistake (i have tried daily trading for week. But each my decision is in 80% terrible. If i reach small profit at least 2 usd i wanna wait for more 10 for example but what happen next. Candle get red color and value start decreasing.

  
I remember a day of Trump Inaguration when i hope for additional growth, but happened opposite. I lost around 60 usd this day. Overaall I lost around 120usd on all crypto what i ever tried to trade since december last year.

Before a few moments around 9:45pm CET i reached some profit around 1.5 usd after i started a position on bad trend. You know what? Me idiot hope for another hype. But i saw a shape of W but rotate on 180 degrees after growing. In this position i had to close position. But i did not do that. After a few minutes the position started falling.

I know my bad. But i need some punch to my face because i need to realize that also small profit is profit.

Shame on me, my mistake, but just not be like me newbies. I am one of us.

If you do not understand each sentence structure i am so sorry. CET means Central European Time and I am basic Slavic guy from Slovakia.

I've created a black-mirror style, choose-your-own-adventure hypertext browser game.

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

**Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.**

The game will unlock as more people play.

[www.motherblack.xyz](http://www.motherblack.xyz)  
  
You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

[Here](https://www.cutehumangame.com/) is the game teaser. It might give you some clues for octolisk.

My last game can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/16b2fsi/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/). It was won in 2 months. My new game is harder by at least 1 order of magnitude. Please keep this in mind.

For each player you collaborate with, your chances of winning increase dramatically. So it is in your best interest to play with friends and split the money.

\* All my games are funded from me working hard in the fiat mines. So please play responsibly. I've created tripwires and ""boobytraps"" in cases of misconduct. Trust me, the only way to win is to play properly.

(ii)   promoting and protecting the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide;

(iii)  protecting and promoting fair and open access to banking services for all law-abiding individual citizens and private-sector entities alike;

(iv)   providing regulatory clarity and certainty built on technology-neutral regulations, frameworks that account for emerging technologies, transparent decision making, and well-defined jurisdictional regulatory boundaries, all of which are essential to supporting a vibrant and inclusive digital economy and innovation in digital assets, permissionless blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies; and

(v)    taking measures to protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States, including by prohibiting the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States.

Sec. 2.  Definitions\*.\*  (a)  For the purpose of this order, the term “digital asset” refers to any digital representation of value that is recorded on a distributed ledger, including cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, and stablecoins.

(b)  The term “blockchain” means any technology where data is:

(i)    shared across a network to create a public ledger of verified transactions or information among network participants;

(iii)  distributed among network participants in an automated fashion to concurrently update network participants on the state of the public ledger and any other functions; and

(iv)   composed of source code that is publicly available.

(c)  “Central Bank Digital Currency” means a form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.

Reddit,ethereum,Seeking Blockchain Co-Founder for Nonprofit AI Language Startup (2000+ African Languages),2025-01-23 10:02:59,"**The Problem:**  
OpenAI, Meta, and Orange recently announced efforts to build AI for African languages. But here’s the catch: Africa has 2,000+ languages, many with little to no digital data. Without datasets, even the best AI models can’t bridge this gap.

**What We’re Doing:**  
We’re a nonprofit team building a blockchain and tokenomics-powered solution to crowdsource, validate, and incentivize the creation of African language datasets. Think decentralized data ownership, community-driven contributions, and equitable AI access.

**Who We Are:**

\- A team of **4 founders with 27+ combined years** in product development, startups, and AI/data systems.

\- Backgrounds: **AI engineer, Data Engineer, Statistician, Product Engineer, Non-profit and Funding**

\- Committed to impact over profit (**nonprofit structure**).

**We Need You:**

\- Blockchain/tokenomics expertise (Solana, Polygon, smart contracts, token design).

\- Technical enough to lead protocol development.

\- Aligned with the mission: Solve the data desert for African languages.

\- Comfortable with early-stage uncertainty (we’re pre-funding).

**No Fluff:**

\- This isn’t a “get rich quick” project, it is for the long haul. If you want hype, look elsewhere.

\- We’re not here to compete with OpenAI or any other AI war-lord—we’re solving the foundational problem they can’t ignore.

\- Remote work, no location preference.

**If This Resonates:**  
DM me with:

\- Your experience with blockchain projects

\- Why you would like to join us.

\- A brief intro about yourself

Let’s build something real.

P.S. Already working on African language datasets, blockchain for social impact, or decentralized AI? Let’s collaborate, not compete.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,ethereum,Not understanding how ETH was stolen from Phantom Wallet,2025-01-21 03:05:50,"Before I get called an idiot, hear me out.

$1800 in ETH straight up vanished 3 hours after I had received it and was sent to an unknown wallet. The $1800 in ETH came from a friend's coinbase and was sent directly to me. I've never bought anything on the Phantom wallet, I've only ever sent and received. I'm trying my hardest to figure out how the hell it's happened. Somehow the wallet is compromised, but I'm struggling to figure out how it's happened. The password is strong/generated by a password manager, I've not shared the private key or seed phrases (the wallet is a week old).

Nothing else was accessed, eg bank, email, any other accounts, just the Phantom wallet (which I have on a chrome extension and on my mobile, which I had downloaded last night).

The wallet that it went to has only seen IN transactions then whatever is the latest (explanations please)

https://etherscan.io/address/0xd924cC0A843a023ba07a436d779Ec1480Dc4c359

Anyone able to advise on where I went wrong?

Never been interested in nfts, airdrops (don't have a clue what they are), not been clicking or trying receive any free shit.

I've been trying to go over absolutely everything I did yesterday and the only thing I can think I went wrong was when I was researching the melania meme coin, I don't know if I had synced or logged in with the Phantom Wallet (that had $0 at the time) to a site when I was looking into ways to buy SOL. I had logged into ape.pro via the Phantom Wallet and I believe I had connected my wallet to uniswap. Something that stood out was there was a jupuary.jup.ag link in my history which I do not recall visiting and nothing prior to the website showing to indicate that I had purposely went out my way to visit.

Any ideas? Anyone able to look into the etherscan to find any clues as to who or what the wallet of the person who stole the money is?

Tl;dr: I'm new as fuck to crypto, have no idea how $1800 was stolen",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,ethereum,HELP - I Need Private Client Server Communication in Web3,2025-01-21 01:22:01,"I won't go into all the fine details here, but the basic problem is I need a way for a client to pass a message to a server and receive a response without the server learning the IP of the client. The message is small and can fit into a tx payload with ease, but I do not want to spam messages into the chain. The server can know the Ethereum address of the client. The solution does not have to be Web3 native. The solution must run in a browser env ( IE I can not handle raw TCP comms at the low levels ). 

I have considered OHTTP via Cloudflare ( not sure if this will actually work in a browser though )

I have considered passing the messages using Txns in chain but hate this idea since it is slow and wasteful in terms of user resources and server resources.

I have considered XMTP but this system is still early stage and highly centralized - meaning it could go offline at any time.

I have considered IPFS but this is a huge pain to say the least and I would prefer to not use it.

I have considered Whisper ( or Wagmu I think is the new name ) but Whisper had terrible support back in the day and I fear it still might.

I have considered Tor but this can not be done in a browser.

I have considered I2P but this can not be done in a browser.

Honestly, at this point I would be happy with paying for a reverse proxy that strips all of the client IP address info and blackholes the logs but I can not find any well established services like this. I did try routing through Cloudflare but for some reason their system always includes the X-Forwarded-For or some variant header no matter what worker stripping or rule stripping you set up...

i aleady loaded up more ETH but i it keeps telling me i need more for a transaction. In my understandings this has nothing to do wit gas fees cause they were like 0.0001 ETH so i dont understand where this is coming from and its frustrating.

Reddit,ethereum,Best Way to Stake Ethereum with a Small Portfolio?,2025-01-19 12:57:23,"Hi everyone,

I’m just starting to invest in Ethereum and exploring staking as a way to earn passive income. At the moment, the ETH part of my portfolio is really small—under $200. I’m doing DCA, so my holdings will gradually grow over time, but for now, it’s definitely modest.

I’ve done some research into staking options, but I must admit that I'm a a bit overwhelmed since I’m still a beginner. Having advice from experienced people would be really helpful.

What’s the best way to stake ETH with such a small amount? Should I simply stake it directly in the exchange until I have a bigger amount?

I want to choose a method that works well for small portfolios but I'm open to suggestions to transition into once it gets bigger. Thanks in advance for your insights! Looking forward to learning from you all.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum’s Scalability Paradox and the Forgotten Stakeholders: Investors,2025-01-19 10:37:51,"Let me just start by saying I am a big believer in the Ethereum ecosystem. I know that this post may be downvoted a lot, but I think it is important to raise these issues and constructively discuss them. That said, I am here to learn and I acknowledge that my understanding might be flawed. If that’s the case, I welcome your insights to help me understand better.

**1. Are L2s hurting Ethereum's tokenomics?**

Layer-2 solutions are critical for Ethereum's scalability, but they seem to be harming its economic model. L2s inherently designed to reduce Ethereum's base layer (or Layer-1) demand. Lower demand, means lower gas fees and by extension reduced burn rate with EIP-1559. Further limiting Eth's deflationary pressure. This can be visualized on Eth supply chart [here](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETH_SUPPLY/). 

With reduced demand, ETH’s price could stagnate or decline. This hurts all investors, validators included.

**2. Failing to understand that every Validator is Investor first.**

Validators are important for maintaining **security and decentralization** of Ethereum network. However, we fail to understand that every validator is an investor first (in a Proof Of Stake environment), and are only tied to the project until it is profitable for them. If Eth price continues to stagnate eventually they will move to other chains. Ultimately compromising Eth's Security and Decentralization. 

**3. Not enough focus on investors?**

I wholeheartedly agree and encouraged by changes in [EF leadership and goals](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1880635379771904423). However, would like to understand what does ""having a vested interest"" mean? Ethereum is a Proof of Stake network. Every validator, investor, developer and user have vested interest. 

I understand that EF is trying to eliminate any influence that large investors (institutional and individual) may have. However, they should be cautious not to ignore the role of the ""investor"" as an important actor contributing to the Ethereum network. 

**4. Community being too critical when investors voice their opinion on price movement.**

While there is a dedicated sub to discuss price movements r/ethtrader, sometimes it isn't that straight forward. When fundaments are not supporting price movements they should not just be discussed but should be encouraged. Often, people here who discuss price are looked down upon despite having very valid points. Community should understand that Ethereum is **Proof of Stake**, and ""Stake"" i.e. Eth as token is integral part of consensus mechanism. 

My hope with this post is to spark constructive discussion and, hopefully, bring about necessary changes if/where they are needed.

Edit: The post doesn’t discuss price increase/decrease, but rather discusses how change in fundamentals are affecting investors (i.e. validators, developers and users) in Eth token.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,ethereum,Ethereum Blobs - Calls for upgrades vs FUD,2025-01-18 17:25:54,"I'm seeing a lot of confusion and misunderstandings on other platforms regarding blobs so I thought I would cross-post this here.   
  
**Previous FUD** = There wouldn't be enough demand for Ethereum DA (blobs)  
**The Truth** = There is more than enough demand and it's growing  
  
**New FUD** = Ethereum won't be able to cope with demand and will either lose out to alt DA or (much) worse alt L1s.   
**The Truth** = Both the devs and the community are aware of the demand and have; Short/Mid/Longer-term solutions. Calls to action are not FUD but many are unaware that there are solutions and this is where the FUD is coming from. Layer 2s can also make trade offs and use ALT DA whilst still paying Ethereum Layer 1 for proofs this is still far better than users going to alt L1.   
  
Before I get into solutions let's cover the **basics of Blob vs Block Storage:**  
Blocks = Persistent = \~90KB on average   
Blobs = Temporary = 128KB Max  
Blob Market (current) = Target 3  / max 6 (per block)  
  
**- Short-Term Solution (Mid/Late March):**  
Pectra: Blob Market = Target 6  / max 9  
  
**- Longer-Term Solutions:**  
PeerDAS - using data availability sampling for blobs will dramatically increase supply to the blob market. Other solutions are being discussed with even longer time frames but these will evolve over time.   
  
**- Mid-Term Solutions:**  
Between Pectra and PeerDAS blobs and the blob market can be upgraded with a soft fork and/or a hard fork that only focuses on blobs requiring less testing and overhead (quicker to implement). These mid-term solutions will likely depend on the community pushing for them. Alternative DA options can still be Ethereum-aligned and will be part of the overall mix of solutions different use cases will likely require different solutions and implementations.   
  
**The Oversimplified Debate:**  
L2s don't pay enough vs L2s need to grow to compete  
  
**More thoughts from Intern:**   
This debate is often framed as 2 opposing ideologies but perhaps it is also 2 different time horizons. While it is true that Layer 2s are currently paying less than they have done historically whilst serving more users it is also true that the market has changed and expects cheaper transaction fees which are available outside the Ethereum ecosystem. Right now the Blob market is highly reactive but once the Blob market grows changes in demand will lead to a more proportionate change in costs and may ultimately result in more being paid to the Layer 1 over the long term. Put simply if fees paid to the L1 per transaction have been reduced by 1000X then if L2s can grow their transaction count by over 1000X then they will pay more overall but growth takes time, investment, and builders.

Reddit,ethereum,Make Blob sizes dynamic ?,2025-01-19 01:51:08,"Perhaps a noob question but:

Pectra is supposed to increase Blob sizes to accommodate more throughput and lower fees, however this will hurt the holders (less burn until more througput comes in).

**Why can't we make Blob sizes dynamic?**

\- Increase in size (automatically) when demand is needed and decrease it when demand is low in order to strike a balance to allow a healthy - constant burn of Eth.

Wasn't Ether supposed to be **Ultra sound** money?

I know we need to attract more projects to join in as L2s (by having lower fees), but if other L1s take ""our cake"" before we achieve our objective, we won't attract more L2s either ways.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145
Reddit,ethereum,ETH - Gas prices,2025-01-19 14:14:47,"Hey I'm fearly new to Crypto.

I currently have a 3 mid cap coins, that are only on the ethereum network. So the most efficient way to get these coins is through swapping them with ETH through the Ethereum main net.

Now ethereum gas prices are probably going to suw.

Is there a way to swap them in a ""bundle"" to ETH, just paying gas once? With a dapp maybe?

The gas prices will probably be just much as the amount I have in these coins even if they 2-3x from now 🫠.

I probably didn't use the right terms as I am new to this but would appreciate some suggestions.

Reddit,ethereum,What is the current state of Eth?,2025-01-19 16:18:32,"Hi,

I used to mine Eth and was a staunch advocate for the project from about 2018-2022. I loved the project! There was always a new drop or project launching on the network and it seemed like Eth would be the project to lead the decentralized DeFi future that I was invested in. I am not a miner that just quit because they went PoS, I was excited and bought the reasons why PoS was a positive. I do miss the insane profits I was getting from mining it, but I had accrued decent number of coins that I was ready to stake to continue the ecosystem. Then, it happened. PoS mainnet upgrade occurred and not only could I not mine, but it took two months for me to find a reputable staking pool.

Fast forward to 2022 and I had completed staking some coin and was left with very small gains in reference to the time I locked the coins up. No big deal, but what was the state of the project? Basically dead. What happened to PoS and the DeFi revolution that I believed in? Well, the insane amount of coin required to run a validator node led (everything from here on is my opinion/perception) to a situation where majority of node owners were the same financial institutions that I was hoping to stick it to. The rich now controlled block validation and the average joe's only option was to buy small amounts of coin and stake it on a pool, hoping it didn't get stolen. Feeling disillusioned with the project, I sold my coins.

It doesn't seem like the PoS move has done any of the proposed goals. The price is stagnant and I don't see the enthusiasm for projects and when I think about nodes I can't help but picture rich people just watching their holdings grow.

I still hold out hope, so what's going on? Anything exciting?",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,ethereum,Bridged USDC ETH/USDC SOL & Cannot find it.,2025-01-18 21:46:40,"I'm somewhat new to crypto, so I'm really seeking some help. I have previously made the mistake of sending crypto to the wrong wallet way back in 2020. Last night in my attempts to convert USDC ETH to USDC SOL, I tried using Soflare to bridge my USDC. While I think it went through, I cannot for the life of me understand what is happening. Today my Coinbase Wallet shows I still own USDC ETH with the same balance, and Metamask shows the same. However when I try to send it, sell it, etc. I'm unable to do so. I THOUGHT the transaction went through, but was in such a rush to purchase the $TRUMP coin last night I had to go ahead and use a different app to get that purchase through. Today however I cannot seem to move my USDC, sell it, or do much of anything and I'm trying to understand what the heck happened. At this point I've spent several hours trying to figure this out, and would really appreciate some help.

Under my transaction history, I have something called a ""Smart Contract"" but I don't understand if I still have my USDC (It does show up) or if this is just an issue with Coinbase Wallet where I temporarily can't do anything with my USDC. If you need any other information to find out what happened, please by all means let me know so I can include that.

# Funding is broken 

Getting money for research is like a nightmare -  bureaucracy, not enough transparency. With DeSci, they’re talking about using DAOs to fund research projects and share research quickly. 

# Turning research into real stuff

Getting from ""cool discovery"" to ""real-world product"" takes forever. Smart contracts could make it faster and ensure researchers actually get paid for their work instead of just getting a ""thanks"" and a handshake.

Reddit,ethereum,Does Ethereum Foundation Really Doesn't Care About Numbers Go Down?,2025-01-18 21:23:46,"In this community people often shame me for only looking at the numbers and care about making profit, and their argument is always we have superior tech, more L1L2 usage, or metrics that doesn't help with profit.

The Ethereum dev circles are like a bunch of people that doesn't talk much about numbers, it seems like they don't care if the numbers go up or down, and to them building ""better"" product is the only thing important.

This entire community seems to force people to be ""in it for the tech"" and largely ignored investors and think they are shortsighted subpar human that are filled with greed and only care about profit.

From my perspective, Ethereum Foundation and dev circles see themselves as a higher tier elitist because they know the code, have higher moral standard and have the ability to build on the project, so they only communicate within themselves.

They also don't care about if other entity want to build project on Ethereum and not willing to give them even a little bit of recognition, and rarely talk about projects being built by third party on the network, for comparison look at Solana tweeter, they are actively interact with projects build on their network.

BUT the fact that Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum are able to grow to this size is largely because they benefits from numbers going up, Ethereum started with an ICO, crowdfunding from investors, and without numbers going up, they won't be able to grow as fast, won't be able to sell their ETH to pay their employee, fund their projects.

There's no tech company or tech project in this capitalism world doesn't care about numbers going up are able to sustain, to grow, to hire more talent, to increase adoption, to promote awareness.

If the numbers stop going up, eventually the funding will be dried up, talents will not waste their talent to build on the network if it won't be rewarded, and it will just slowly fade into irrelevance.

I think Ethereum Foundation should start allocate more fundings on their marketing department, and their business development department. Start talking to more businesses to consider building their project on the network, talking to more developers to build, interact more with anyone still have any interest in Ethereum, be it just investors that only cares about profit or businesses or coders, do more sponsorships, be more aggressive in marketing.

Attract more capital to expand and grow, provide more grant to promising project, etc

Stop shaming people only care about profits and numbers going up, these are investors, the only people still believe in the project and invested their money into project, stop telling them to fuck off because they complain about the numbers going down, in real world do we see tech company telling their VC to fuck off because their VC complain about non-performing?",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Also unspent money or inactive wallets (forgotten passwords), will automatically get taxed so over time eventually cleared out, and put back in circulation. It solves that problem too.

Reddit,ethereum,To Pump The Gas Or Not: Analyzing The Ethereum Gas Limit Debate,2025-01-17 20:56:20,"As Ethereum continues to evolve, one of the key topics being discussed is the proposal to increase the gas limit. This proposal has garnered a ton attention among the community for its potential to scale the network, reduce transaction fees, and enable new types of decentralized applications (dapps). However, a higher gas limit also raises important concerns about decentralization, validator hardware requirements, and overall network stability.

In this post, I’ve shared an article that delves into the origins of the proposal, potential benefits, and the challenges that come with it. The article covers:

- The history of past attempts to raise gas limits on Ethereum 
- How the gas limit could be gradually raised without a network fork
- Predictable effects of a higher gas limit, like lower gas fees and improved transaction flows
- The potential for new types of dapps, such as on-chain AI and large-scale token operations, to emerge if network capacity increases 
- Risks to decentralization and security, including validator hardware requirements and MEV disparities, and other potentially negative byproducts of higher gas limits

If you’re interested in a deep dive on the topic, check out the article and share your thoughts. What do you think about the gas limit increase? Could it help Ethereum scale without compromising its core principles?

Reddit,ethereum,Questions About Layer 1’s,2025-01-17 04:40:01,"Hi everyone! I just got into self custody of my coins and swapping for newer/smaller tokens that aren’t listed on exchanges yet. 

This drove me to really want to understand how layer 1’s prices are driven up by the layers 2’s. For example, does Ethereum’s price go up because people are buying the layer 2’s and holding them? Or does it go up because of people holding stack of Ethereum’s to pay for gas fees? 

This is also making me wonder for example why Solana’s price has gone up compared to Ethereum (besides Ethereum gas fees), because even though Solana has cheaper gas fees, I don’t see the amount of legitimate projects on it compared to Solana. For example, every time I see a video on an up and coming AI project, gaming or any other hot niche it’s almost always on Ethereum. Is Solana just getting its boost in market cap off meme coins and/or big investors holding SOL just to hold combine with the narrative on better speed and gas fees?? 

This is NOT me hating on Ethereum. I’m just genuinely curious because Ethereum’s ecosystem is bigger and still continuing to get projects from my understanding.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Completely FALSE. OP needs to learn what rolling 30 day % change figures are and how they work.

To put it simply... Lets say for arguments sake that retail volume was 100 Bitcoin daily. 

If retail volume is up roughly 30% over 30 days (AKA the spike in the graph to 30% or so, clearly due to election result), that means daily retail demand is now 130 Bitcoin. 

If over the next 30 days the daily demand is down 20%, it means daily demand is now 104 Bitcoin. 

AKA the daily demand is not only not even remotely close to the lowest in 3 years. It's not even the lowest in the last 60 days. It is in fact higher at the end of the 20% fall than 60 days prior.

Sorry to post here but I don't know where to post this as the binance sub is fully control by binance mods and I can't create a post and get answers from actual users.

I tried to close my binance (not binance us) account recently as I haven't really use it for years.

I followed the procedure and closed it and it said my account was closed.

However, I never received any confirmation email, which I find very odd, as they usually send emails for everything. Thus, considering some shady practices of exchanges and Binance's reputation, I wonder if they actually closed my account.

Have any of you ever closed a binance account  (not a binance us account) here and do you know if you received a confirmation by mail right away or later ?

It's also quite problematic as I need a proof my account was closed 

 I alao don't want to keep receiving airdrops and stuff which could have tax implications where I am from and which binance may continue to do if my account isn't really closed.

Reddit,bitcoin,crypto . com best alternatives to US residents,2025-01-24 18:58:48,"US Resident (California). 

Crypto . com consistently shows BTC at $1000 higher than other exchanges. I planned to LIMIT sell over 1 BTC, however i only found out today that crypto only lets me do $5k increments (20 orders per day), unless i'm a ""Plus"" member (i.e. $1M assets minimum) which is just ridiculous. When I do a market sell, suddenly the market rate is $3k less than ticker price.

BTC chart says $107,900.  Won't let me do .5 BTC limit sell because I'm not ""Plus"" member.  Go to Spot price, and .5 BTC is $52,500 - which is a $105,000 BTC price. That spread is absolutely ridiculous and completely scammy.

Reddit,bitcoin,Inflation in numbers: How much harder are we working? Comparing 1970s and 2025,2025-01-23 13:45:43,"How things have changed since the 1970s in terms of how much we work to afford basic things like housing and rent.

**Spoiler: We're working harder and earning much less for it!**


---

**1. Wages:**

1970 Average Hourly Wage: \~$3.50/hour

2025 Average Hourly Wage: \~$25.72/hour (U.S. national average)

Now, $3.50/hour in 1970 should be equivalent to around **$123/hour today**, based on the money supply increase (M2), which grew by a **35x factor** from 1970 to 2025.

In simple terms, to keep up with inflation and money supply growth, wages should have grown by about 35x times, not just 7 times as they have.


---

**2. Housing Affordability:**

1970 Average Home Price: \~$17,000

2025 Average Home Price: \~$374,900


Working Hours to Buy a Home:

1970s: 4,857 hours (at $3.50/hour)

2025: 14,580 hours (at $25.72/hour)

Home prices have increased by about **22x** since the 1970s, but wages have only increased about 7x.

If wages had kept pace with the 22x increase in housing prices, wages should be around **$77.18/hour**.

And these are just averages, we're not even looking at the ridiculous cities like: Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Miami, SFC, London, Sydney, Ottawa.


---

**3. Rent Affordability:**

1970 Median Monthly Rent: \~$108

2025 Median Monthly Rent: \~$2,000


Working Hours to Pay Rent:

1970s: 31 hours/month (at $3.50/hour)

2025: 78 hours/month (at $25.72/hour)

Rent has increased by about **18x** since the 1970s, while wages have increased by 7x. To match 1970s affordability, today's wage would need to be closer to **$64.50/hour**.


---


**4. The Changing Nature of Work:**

Today’s jobs are far more complex than in the 1970s, especially in fields like technology, finance, and engineering. For example:

Computer Engineers and Software Developers must not only possess years of education but also continually upgrade their skills to keep up with rapid technological change.

Stock Traders and Investment Bankers are under immense pressure to beat market returns and take on more risk to justify their pay. This requires constant analysis, long hours, and a high level of mental stress.

Many of these jobs have become headache-inducing as the demands increase and the pressure to perform is relentless.

These roles can often come with long working hours, high stress, and little downtime, but the pay doesn't reflect the level of education, output, or stress compared to the 1970s.

So for example, earning $55/hour as a Software Engineer, you are still making less than a Grocery Bagger in the 1970s, because you must work more hours to pay rent or buy a house.

Higher education vs. uneducated, high responsibility vs. no responsibility, and yet, you're working longer hours for less purchasing power.


---

**Key Takeaways:**

Money Supply & Inflation: The money supply (M2) has increased 35x from 1970 to 2025. If wages had kept up with that growth, today's wages should be about $123/hour.

Housing & Rent: While wages have increased by 7x, housing and rent prices have far outpaced that growth, making them much less affordable today than in the 1970s.

Working Harder for Less: Despite the increased complexity and higher educational demands in today’s jobs, we're still working harder, producing more results, and receiving less. Wages haven't kept pace with the mental and physical demands of modern jobs.

**What is a Fair Wage?** To compensate us for the higher complexity and greater output, we should be earning **MORE THAN** $123/hour today. The average salary should be closer to **$250/hour** to make all that education, experience accumulation, increased productivity and its related stress worthwhile.


---

**So in conclusion,** IF YOU ARE EARNING LESS THAN $250/hour, you are right to feel EXHAUSTED and CHEATED.

Considering that I'm a software engineer earning less than 1/5th of that, it explains and makes sense why I feel absolutely exhausted all the time, and can't even come close to owning a home or feel financially safe enough to start a family.

Reddit,bitcoin,I'm 44 and focused on retirement.  Should BTC be an after thought?,2025-01-23 06:58:37,"I just started buying BTC in late November 2024.  So, far I've put in about $3000.  I'm currently in a position where I can invest $2,000 a month to whatever I want.  My options are buy more BTC, pay off my house in 8 yeas instead of 26 years or apply it to traditional investments (S&P, IRA..etc).  

I believe BTC will do great in the coming years, but as it gets more expensive, my $2K buy less and less.  I don't know if I'll be able to own enough BTC by the time I ready to retire...I also wonder if bitcoin is a great retirement strategy?   

If we pretend that the price of bitcoin goes up by $100,000 each year, I would have 1 coin by mid 2032.  ",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

But I will say it’s easy to look at the current marketcap of $6B which is “below lots of other meme coins” and think it has room to grow. But you’re playing against the clock, the circulating supply will be doing a 5x over the next years and if it was fully distributed right now the fully distributed marketcap would still be over $31B and it would be a top ten crypto asset by marketcap.

It might not be this time but at some point you’re going to get trapped. When coins have immediate mass inflation (see Algorand inflating 400% in 2021) it will inevitably create lots and lots of bag holders.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

You can’t do that with Ripple.,2025-01-24 10:15:09,"Everyone talks about centralization, with companies and foundations exerting control over blockchains, but have you ever seen a blockchain that's so centralized and permissioned that it cannot even be audited?

The Ripple/XRP ""blockchain"" is broken since the first 32,569 blocks are ""lost"". The company **deleted** all those blocks.

This company has been aggressively promoting CBDC for years, funded media attacks on Bitcoin using money they got by dumping their premined shitcoin, and now they're spending their premined loot in DC to lobby against Bitcoin and pushing for corporate-issued CBDC.

If there's a ""cryptocurrency"" that is the sworn nemesis of everything Bitcoin stands for, it's Ripple. By far, the most blatant scam in the industry.

Ripple has no reason to even use a blockchain except to deceive people into a false notion of affinity to Bitcoin.

EDIT:

For those saying the murder for hire thing was debunked/he wasn't convicted of it, here's a passage from page 33 of the 2016 appellate decision upholding his conviction:

""At the sentencing hearing, the district court resolved several disputed issues of fact. For example, because Ulbricht contested his responsibility for the five commissioned murders for hire, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Ulbricht did in fact commission the murders, believing that they would be carried out. The district court characterized the evidence of the murders for hire, which included Ulbricht’s journal, chats with other Silk Road users, and the evidence showing that Ulbricht actually paid a total of $650,000 in Bitcoins for the killings, as “ample and unambiguous.” App’x 1465.""

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,What do you think about UTXO Stack? (BTC Liquidity Staking Protocol + Stablecoin on Lightning Network),2025-01-24 22:50:42,"

The team behind Nervos Network (CKB) has proposed UTXO Stack, a decentralized liquidity staking layer to tackle the limitations of the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), such as liquidity issues, onboarding barriers, and the lack of stablecoin support. Their approach integrates the LN with the Fiber Network to create a Hybrid Network, introducing stablecoins, automated liquidity management, and zero-cost channel opening.

Key features include:

1. **Decentralized Liquidity Staking Pool (DLSP):** Improves liquidity efficiency by enabling liquid staking derivatives and automated management.
2. **Hybrid Network:** Integrates LN with Fiber Network for stablecoin support and better connectivity, so you can pay with bitcoin and merchant receives USD stablecoin
3. **Zero-Cost Onboarding:** Simplifies LN adoption by advancing funds for channel setup.

They also propose use cases like decentralized swaps, AI agent payments, and composability with DeFi. The project aims to create a scalable, user-friendly payment system aligned with Web5 principles.

What do you think about this solution? Can it truly address LN's challenges and drive mass adoption?

The protocol uses transaction fees and circulating supply subsidies to fairly distribute rewards, enhancing the ecosystem's sustainability and incentivization structure.

This update represents a significant milestone in further decentralizing the Algorand network. Since its implementation, the network has seen an 89% increase in active nodes, with the United States, Germany, and Great Britain accounting for 58% of total node activity. By empowering more participants to contribute to the network's operations, this upgrade not only strengthens security but also reinforces Algorand's commitment to being a robust, decentralized, and inclusive blockchain.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Can a Layer 1 Blockchain Be Rugpulled?,2025-01-24 08:36:54,"Hey everyone,

I've recently stumbled upon a meme blockchain project that caught my eye. Interestingly, it's a **Layer 1 blockchain with Proof-of-Work** with a pretty low market cap (around 60M$). That project is existing since more then 1 year and is still very active.

 I'm considering investing a bit into it, but I have some concerns. **I don't want to make any advertisment, so I'm not telling which project it is.** 

Can a Layer-1-PoW blockchain be rugpulled? If so, how does that happen?

I understand that rug pulls are more common in DeFi projects, or L2-Tokens, but I'm curious if the same risks apply to Layer 1 blockchains. What should I be looking out for to avoid getting scammed?

Thanks in advance for your insights!",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Where do you find projects / investments,2025-01-25 02:15:49,"Simple question: I’m just genuinely curious about where most people gather the knowledge and resources that guide their financial investments. Of course, Reddit is one popular source of information, but I’m wondering how it stacks up against other methods—like following dedicated finance websites, chatting in specialized online forums, relying on social media influencers, or even turning to more traditional avenues such as newspapers, magazines, and television programs. In your opinion, which of these approaches truly reigns supreme for discovering new opportunities and making well-informed decisions?

As a follow-up, I’d love to know how you handle the actual process of investing: do you prefer to stay on chain, working directly with decentralized protocols? Or do you prefer using centralized exchanges (CEXs)?

I've hidden seed words throughout it. You must solve puzzles and combine clues to find these seed words.

Once found, these words will form seed phrases that can be used to unlock various wallets containing a total of 1.2 ETH (currently worth \~$6k AUD)\*.

The game will unlock as more people play. Feel free to share, I've spent months making this.

You do not need to connect your wallet at any point. You must solve the puzzles to get the seed words (think of it like proof-of-work). There is no other way to win. This game is out of my control now.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Decentralized Dreams,2025-01-24 07:52:05,"Honestly, DePINs sound like they could be a game-changer, right? Like, imagine we could all have a say in how our internet or energy works, without some big corporation pulling the strings. It's a nice thought, this idea that we could all come together to make things better, more accessible, and maybe even cheaper.

But let's cut the idealism with a dose of reality. First off, getting everyone to agree on anything is like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. Then there's the whole mess with laws and regulations that weren't written with this kind of stuff in mind. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, and that can slow things down big time.

And let's not forget trust. We're so used to having one company or government to blame when things go wrong. With DePINs, if something breaks, who do you yell at? It's a bit like a community garden; everyone loves the idea until they realize they have to actually do the work.

There's also the tech side. Blockchain and all that jazz? It's cool, but it's not without its headaches. Energy use, the complexity of making sure everything's secure... it's not just plug-and-play.

So while I'm all for shaking up the system, I'm also not naive enough to think it's going to be all smooth sailing. It's like being excited for a road trip but knowing you might have to deal with flat tires along the way.

However, in order for this to be secure, does the market cap of ETH need to be e.g. 5x the market cap of the real world assets tokenized on the chain in order to provide the level of economic security required to make a 51% attack on the network economically unviable?",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

What do yall use to trade crypto. 

I use coinbase 

Coinbase wallet 

Phantom wallet 

I purchased $10k of SPX6900
Sold at $22,500. 

After selling/swapped I only received $19,500 USDC

There was a coinbase fee of $225 
Slippage fee 
Etherum gas fee 

Somehow it ended being a lot more than expected. 

I was trying to sell at the top
Then buy low

Rinse n repeat. 

 Please help. With advice seems like it’s best to long term hodl. With all the fees. 

This was all done using 
Coinbase to buy etherum. Then sent to my coinbase wallet. Purchased SPX. Then swapped to USDC. I am located in the USA. 
Is this just how crypto is. An enormous fee. Or am I just using the wrong wallet. 
For example. I trade on Webull with stocks. Mostly long term holder. But when I sell there is no 1% fee. Then gas fee. Then slippage fee. 

Please help. Or DM. It does not matter. 
Thank you very much. 

I am looking to buy memes. Then sell when they pump. Then re invest at the dip. 
For example. SPX6900 is an amazing meme coin. That has a great resistance levels. Pumps. Then consolidates at resistance. Then pumps again. But due to the fees. I’m not making money at all. If I am. It’s not much.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht might still have around 430 Bitcoin worth over $47 million across several wallets.,2025-01-22 21:42:58,"Recently pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht might still have around 430 Bitcoin worth over $47 million across several wallets. According to blockchain researcher Conor Grogan, he has identified several wallets associated with Ulbricht holding the BTC.

Grogan shared the news on X, noting that these wallets have not been touched in the last 13 years, a sign that the US government did not confiscate them. The US government had recovered around 50,000 Bitcoin from Ulbricht when he was arrested in 2013 for operating the darknet marketplace.

He wrote:

“I found ~430 BTC across dozens of wallets associated with Ross Ulbricht that were not confiscated by the USGovt and have been untouched for 13+ years. Back then these were probably dust wallets, now, collectively, they are worth about $47M.”

However, Grogan added that Ulbricht likely does not have the keys to those wallets, which is why the government could not gain access to them. Still, the uncovering of BTC connected to Ulbricht has led to speculations as to what impact the selling of BTC could have on his pardon. Some users noted that he cannot sell the BTC even if he has the keys since the assets are proceeds from a crime.

Meanwhile, others have criticized Grogan for disclosing the information, noting that the addresses should be kept private. In response, the researcher noted that the addresses are already public as they were cited in the trial documents, and many people are likely tracking them.

Crypto community praises Ross Ulbricht’s release

Still, the crypto community has been celebrating Ross Ulbricht’s release since President Trump announced his full pardon. For many, the decision represents Trump’s commitment to the crypto industry and also vindicates the use of decentralized and privacy-oriented applications. The pardon coincides with the US Court decision to lift the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction on crypto mixer Tornado Cash.

Bitcoin advocate Ben Sigman noted that the Ulbricht release is a major win against government overreach and a well-deserved justice. In a long post on X, Sigman, who wrote the Big Bitcoin Book, defended Ulbricht, noting that while Silk Road might have been problematic, the punishment against him was also disproportionate.

He wrote:

“This isn’t just about Ross or a marketplace—it’s about government overreach and the state’s power to crush individuals with vague laws.”

Others, such as early Bitcoin adopter Jameson Loop, also thanked President Donald Trump for the decision. He wrote:

“Thank you, @POTUS. I hereby grant you a full and unconditional pardon for all past and future shitcoinery.”

With Ulbricht now released, many people have started donating funds to him as he attempts to restart his life. Over $130,000 has been raised through the official Free Ross campaign, with one person recently donating one BTC to the cause. Strike also launched a merch in his honor, with 100% of the proceeds after expenses donated to him.

Meanwhile, not all reactions to his release have been positive. There are several people on X who have questioned his pardon, noting that Ulbricht indeed committed crimes. Some bad actors have also tried to exploit his release to launch memecoins but a statement from his official X account already denied any affiliation with a memecoin.

""Going Concern

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net loss of $610,291. The Company was not able to cover its operational costs with the product and services sales generated and will likely need to further invest in marketing for user acquisition to increase COIN App income and advertising revenue to reach break-even for its products and services. As a result, the Company may incur further operating losses and seek to fund its operations through equity and/or debt financing or other sources, as it deems necessary.

Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, including due to general macroeconomic conditions or unforeseen factors. If the Company fails to raise capital or generate liquidity through the sale of its products and services, it will have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies.

Those conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern from the filing date of this Semi-Annual Report on Form 1-SA.

The image I'm seling is my own creation, with a resolution of 1280x960 - great for a desktop background. 
Anyway, it's been a pleasure to meet you all. 

My Address is 1BHtsCnpmTvpgJEP7eMKEVhpJFunxSM8vq. If this generates any interest, I could offer some more of my pictures.. ""

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Reddit,crypto,The official AES test vectors look incorrect,2025-01-22 15:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,crypto,"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",2025-01-16 23:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,crypto,Regev's cryptosystem ,2025-01-13 18:08:39,"Hello, i'm sort of confused by a small point on Regev's pke.

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,crypto,Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,2025-01-08 08:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)

But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Reddit,crypto,Making CTR mode commiting,2024-11-29 20:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Reddit,crypto,Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2024-11-21 12:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE.

Reddit,crypto,Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2024-11-21 03:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key

Reddit,crypto,Key ring file format?,2024-11-18 00:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Reddit,crypto,Webapp Encryption at Rest,2024-11-08 07:11:17,"im working on a javascript UI framework for personal projects and im trying to create something like a React-hook that handles ""encrypted at rest"".

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The latest version of the code can be seen in the PR: [https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9)",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,crypto,How to apply Pohlig Hellman using a very limited set of auxiliary inputs in that case ?,2024-11-04 15:25:21,"So I was reading about [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1321). The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime−1* for prime curves or *order−1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‑step giant‑step variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is : no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn’t a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm… 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I’m wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon** : but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic.",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145

Reddit,crypto,Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,2024-11-04 11:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.
    
    Thanks!",2025-01-25 12:15:55.106145
