As bullish sentiment begins to build, market participants are now focused on whether UNI can maintain this upward momentum and break new ground.  As UNI continues to display strength, this analysis aims to determine whether Uniswap’s recent upward movement in spite of the broader bearish market conditions, has the potential to break through key resistance levels and reach new highs by examining the current price action and technical indicators. Indicators Point Toward More Upward Movement For Uniswap On the 4-hour chart, Uniswap is showing strength as it approaches the $8.7 resistance level while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). UNI’s positioning above the SMA indicates a firm trend, suggesting that buyers are gaining confidence with the potential of targeting higher resistance levels. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) points to the possibility of continued upward movement, as the RSI has rebounded to the 73% threshold after previously dipping to 52%. This rise indicates that positive momentum is gaining traction, suggesting that buyers are increasingly in control and that further gains could be on the horizon. Related Reading: UNI Bullish Rebound Signals Upsurge, Targets $8.7 Resistance Ahead After successfully breaking above the daily 100-day SMA, UNI has been exhibiting strong upbeat movement signifying a shift in market sentiment, with buyers gaining confidence and pushing the price higher. If Uniswap can sustain this push, it may open the door for additional price appreciation and challenge higher resistance levels. Furthermore, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 65%, having risen from a previous low of 43%. This upward movement suggests that UNI is gaining momentum, signaling more growth. If buying interest continues to hold steady, the positive trajectory indicated by the RSI could support an extended rally for Uniswap, reinforcing positive sentiment in the market. Potential Upside Targets: How Far Can the Bulls Push UNI? As Uniswap maintains its upward momentum, the immediate resistance level to watch is $8.7, which could pave the way for a challenge of higher thresholds if surpassed. A breakout above this level could see UNI targeting the $10.3 mark, where significant psychological resistance may come into play. Related Reading: UNI In Trouble? Key Indicators Cites Potential Drop Amid Market Downturn However, if Uniswap fails to maintain this strength and breaks above the $8.7 resistance level, it could result in a pullback, with the price sliding back toward the $6.7 support zone. A breakdown below this level could lead to more losses, possibly targeting lower support areas. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

This is bullish for the flagship crypto, considering what happened last year when the fractal pattern formed.  Bitcoin Prices Flashes Fractal Similar To October 2023 TradingShot mentioned in a TradingView post that the Bitcoin fractal similar to the one that occurred in October 2023 is happening again. He explained that the similarities are more evident in the 1D timeframe, where the Bitcoin price currently ranges within the 1D 50-day moving average (MA) and the 1D 200 MA. According to him, BTC also traded similarly precisely a year ago in the first two weeks of October 2023.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle In October 2023, BTC is said to have made a marginal break above the 1D 200 MA before quickly pulling back below it. TradingShot further revealed that the Bitcoin price started its “long-term aggressive rally” of the Channel Up after it tested and held the 1D 50 MA, peaking on March 14 this year, when it hit its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin tested and held this 1D 50 MA at the start of this month, indicating another long-term aggressive rally might be on the horizon. TradingShot claimed that as long as the 1-week 50 MA continues to hold as the long-term support, there is a high probability that the Bitcoin price could hit $100,000 even before the end of this year.    From a fundamentals angle, market experts like Standard Chartered have also predicted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 even before the US presidential elections on November 5. Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts expect BTC to at least come close to this price level based on their prediction that the flagship crypto could hit $90,000 if Donald Trump wins the elections.  What Next For The Leading Crypto? The Bitcoin price has remained stagnant amid market uncertainty thanks to the macro data, the upcoming US elections and rising tensions in the Middle East. This has raised questions about what to expect next from the leading crypto with such a bearish outlook. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided some insights, predicting that BTC could soon lose the $60,000 support level. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens While noting that Bitcoin remains stuck in a descending parallel channel, Martinez remarked that a recent rejection of the upper bounder could lead to a decline to the middle boundary at $58,000. He added that the BTC price could drop to the lower boundary at $52,000. According to him, a bullish breakout for Bitcoin won’t happen until its price clears $66,000.  At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $61,000, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Currently trading at $2,392, Ethereum is down 1.5% in the past 24 hours, adding to its gradual decline in recent days. This drop follows a brief price surge last week, where Ethereum saw a slight surge to above $2,600. Despite the minor increase, Ethereum remains down by 51% from its all-time high of $4,878, recorded in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Retests $2,350: Is a Bounce In The Cards? Ethereum Potential To Fall 53% The sideways movement in Ethereum’s price has left traders cautious. Amid this, renowned crypto analyst Ali has offered his perspective on Ethereum’s current trajectory in a recent post on X. Ali pointed out that Ethereum’s price action tends to follow a particular pattern based on TD Sequential indicators. He explained that whenever Ethereum breaks above the TD setup resistance trendline, a strong bull run often ensues. However, when Ethereum dips below the TD setup support trendline, it typically results in a significant price correction. According to Ali, Ethereum is nearing a critical support level of $2,250, warning that if this support is breached, it could trigger a major price drop. Ali further emphasized that ETH has previously seen an average of 53% corrections following similar breakdowns, suggesting that losing the $2,250 level could spell trouble for the cryptocurrency. Each time #Ethereum breaks above the TD setup resistance trendline 🔴, a strong bull run follows. But when $ETH breaks below the TD setup support trendline 🟢, we’ve seen an average 53% correction.

A crypto analyst going by the name EtherNasYoNAL on X recently shared a bullish outlook for ETH, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of entering a new “mega bull” cycle. According to the analyst, ETH is currently in the final stages of what they describe as a “retest and accumulation process.” This phase is reminiscent of Ethereum’s price movements in 2020, where it underwent a similar process before the 2021 mega bull run. The analyst added that Ethereum’s price action in the months of August, September, and October 2020 followed a specific pattern, with accumulation and retests before the asset saw a significant rise. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens EtherNasYoNAL believes Ethereum is currently mirroring this process and is poised to enter another mega bull cycle, expected to occur around 2025.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Dogecoin Could Break Yearly Highs ‘Any Moment Now’ – Crypto Analyst,2024-10-10 21:00:55+00:00,"Dogecoin is currently testing a crucial demand level after experiencing a 23% decline from its local highs of $0.13. As the meme coin navigates this turning point, the broader crypto market anticipates a potential rally in the coming weeks, driven by the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates. However, October kicked off with increased selling pressure, leaving investors searching for signs of strength in Dogecoin’s price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Failed Attempt To Break $64,000 Could Lead To A Disaster – Analyst Top analyst Mister Crypto has shared a bullish outlook, stating that Dogecoin could begin its next rally “any time now.” His technical analysis highlights key support levels and suggests that the current price could be a launchpad for significant upside movement.  Despite the recent dip, many traders remain optimistic that DOGE could soon recover and enter a new bullish phase. All eyes are now on whether Dogecoin can hold its critical demand level and break out shortly. Dogecoin Testing Crucial Demand Dogecoin is currently surrounded by speculation as investors and analysts offer varying opinions on its future price action. After several weeks of significant ups and downs, the meme coin has seen massive volatility, reflecting the broader market’s uncertainty. Some analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s prospects, while others caution against getting too bullish too soon. A technical analysis shared by prominent analyst Mister Crypto on X suggests a potentially bullish scenario for DOGE. His analysis highlights a 4-day (4D) price chart, where a bullish triangle pattern has just been broken. This breakout signals a possible rally ahead, which, if realized, could lead to gains exceeding 100%. Mister Crypto’s forecast has sparked renewed hope among Dogecoin traders, who are now carefully managing their risk in anticipation of this potential move. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details However, despite the optimism, there is still no clear confirmation that Dogecoin has entered a new bull run. For this bullish scenario to be validated, the price must close above the current demand level and hold support. Until then, the market remains cautious, and investors are waiting for further price action to confirm whether Dogecoin will break out or continue to trade sideways. With so much speculation and uncertainty, the coming days will be critical for DOGE’s trajectory. Price Action: Technical Levels To Hold Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.106 after experiencing an 8% dip since Monday. The price has lost both the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $0.107 and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.108, placing DOGE in a precarious position as it now tests crucial demand levels. For bullish momentum to return, DOGE needs to break back above these key indicators and reclaim the $0.12 mark. A surge beyond this level could set the stage for a higher push, giving bulls the control they need to shift market sentiment. However, the current market environment remains fragile, and any failure to recapture the 4-hour MAs could signal further downside. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand If DOGE fails to hold its current levels, analysts anticipate a deeper correction that could drive the price down to around $0.08, a key support zone. Traders are watching closely to see if DOGE can stabilize or if more downside is ahead. This makes the coming days crucial for determining whether the meme coin can rebound or face further selling pressure. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Canary Capital, a boutique Sydney investment and corporate advisory firm has just filed an XRP ETF, following Bitwise’s lead. With the new ETF filing, the price of XRP could see a possible change in the future.  Canary Capital Files New XRP ETF On Tuesday, October 8, Canary Capital submitted an official S-1 filing for an XRP ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing comes just after Bitwise, another top asset management company filed for an ETF on September 30, marking the first ever XRP–based ETF in the crypto market.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle According to Canary Capital’s new filing, the Trust’s investment goal is to provide direct exposure to the value of XRP, enabling investors to access this cryptocurrency’s market through a brokerage account. Through this method, Canary Capital intends to limit the potential barriers to accessing the market and reduce the risks involved in acquiring and holding XRP.  Canary Capital has also stated that it aims to track the performance of XRP in the market, as measured by the Trust’s Pricing Benchmark. This pricing benchmark will utilize a similar methodology to the real-time price of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) CF Ripple index.  While divulging the objectives and risk factors associated with an XRP ETF, Canary Capital failed to disclose the identity of the custodian for its potential XRP ETF. The investment management company also did not provide details on the ticker to be used for its XRP ETF, however, revealed that the Trustee for the investment product would be the Delaware Trust company.  Despite the optimism Canary Capital’s new XRP ETF filing has generated in the crypto community, both its application and Bitwise’s still require approval from the SEC before they can launch in the market.  Presently, the likelihood of a swift approval appears low, considering Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the regulator. Earlier this month, the US SEC submitted a new appeal to challenge the court’s July 2023 ruling that programmatic sales of XRP are not considered securities.  XRP Price Falls As Regulatory Uncertainty Clouds Optimism Despite Canary Capital’s new XRP ETF filing, the price of XRP has been on a downward trend, showing no signs of moving out of bearish momentum trends. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that XRP has fallen by 0.72% in the last 24 hours and another 0.79% over the past week.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Fails At MA-200, Is A Crash To $52,000 Coming? The cryptocurrency has been in the red for the past few weeks, only seeing slight gains when market conditions turn significantly favorable. With the new XRP ETF, many would expect the XRP price to rally, as anticipation for the investment product builds in the crypto space. However, XRP is still consolidating around the $0.5 mark, even experiencing a decrease in its 24-hour trading volume.  It is clear that XRP’s bullish momentum has been completely overshadowed by regulatory uncertainty and negative sentiment. Despite this, many in the XRP community continue to maintain a positive outlook, expecting the price of XRP to break out to the upside soon.  Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Accused Of Trading $2B In Crypto As ‘Unregistered Dealer’ In a statement released on Thursday, the SEC revealed that Chicago-based Cumberland DRW is accused of trading over $2 billion in crypto assets offered and sold as alleged “securities” in violation of federal registration requirements designed to protect investors.  The SEC’s complaint alleges that Cumberland has been engaging in these activities since at least March 2018, acting as an “unregistered dealer” by buying and selling crypto assets for its own accounts as part of its regular business operations. Related Reading: US Charges 14 Individuals And Four Crypto Companies In Major ‘Sham Trading’ Scandal According to the firm’s website, it provided “deep, reliable liquidity” in crypto assets, as well as investing in technology, claiming to have decades of experience in the field.  Cumberland DRW has publicly positioned itself as “one of the world’s leading liquidity providers” in the digital asset market, operating around the clock and executing trades with counterparties via telephone and its online platform, Marea.  Cumberland also offered spot cryptocurrency liquidity, and operations for “dozens” of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, for institutional investors in the market. Other services offered by the company included options and futures trading, bilateral crypto options, and non-deliverable forwards.  SEC Seeks Penalties Against Cumberland DRW The SEC further alleges that Cumberland has been trading crypto assets treated as investment contracts on third-party exchanges. Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, stated:  The federal securities laws require all dealers in all securities to register with the Commission, and those who operate in the crypto asset markets are no exception.  Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat The SEC’s Head Of the digital assets divison noted that despite industry claims equating crypto asset sales to commodity sales, the SEC’s complaint asserts that Cumberland, the issuers, and investors viewed the transactions as investments in securities. Tenreiro further alleged:  Cumberland profited from its dealer activity in these assets without providing investors and the market with the important protections afforded by registration. The SEC’s complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and charges Cumberland with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The agency is seeking permanent injunctive relief, recovery of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the firm.

According to their recent analysis, token holders are bearish the most on Chainlink–a middleware solution that powers DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. Out of their assessment, it is interesting to note that these coins on focus are those in the top 10, except for Chainlink that is still perched outside the top 20. While Chainlink tops the list, others, mainly Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin, are in the top 5. Chainlink Struggling Despite CCIP Success, Ethereum Disappoints Although Santiment didn’t provide a reason to explain why the community is bearish on these tokens, there are fundamental factors that prop up this outlook. Despite being a leader in DeFi through their Oracle solution and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), Chainlink still struggles for momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Market Shift: Are We Near A Major Sell-Off? LINK, the native token, rose to as high as $22, which is below the 2021 highs and is currently down 53% from the 2024 highs. Considering its role in DeFi and NFTs, holders expected the token to float higher, outperforming the market. This was especially so after the launch of the CCIP solution, which has found adoption among some of the top DeFi and TradFi platforms. Pessimism about Ethereum’s outlook could also stem from disappointment following the approval of the first batch of spot Ethereum ETFs. Unlike Bitcoin, whose prices ripped higher, breaking above $70,000 to as high as $74,000, spot Ethereum ETFs have not been as successful. As of October 10, Soso Value shows that all issuers in the United States managed just over $6.6 billion. Even so, there are massive outflows from Grayscale’s ETHE, heaping massive pressure on ETH prices.

As the broader crypto market faces uncertainty, analysts and investors closely monitor whether this range represents an accumulation phase that could precede a significant rally. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details Top analyst and investor Mister Crypto recently shared a technical analysis comparing Solana’s current price structure to its 2021 performance, highlighting similarities that suggest a potential bullish breakout. His analysis reflects optimism amid market anxiety, with many believing Solana may be on the verge of another strong upward movement. While caution remains, investors await confirmation that Solana’s recent range-bound trading is laying the foundation for a sustained rally. The outcome in the next few weeks could significantly impact Solana’s trajectory for the rest of the year. Solana Price Action: Accumulation Or Bull Trap? Solana (SOL) has been trading within a range of $210 to $110 since mid-March, and while some investors are starting to believe this could be a bull trap rather than accumulation, others remain cautiously optimistic.  A growing sentiment suggests that Solana’s prolonged sideways movement may not lead to the much-anticipated breakout but could lead to further declines. Despite these concerns, prominent analyst Mister Crypto provides a more bullish perspective. In his latest analysis, Mister Crypto compares the current market sentiment around Solana to that of 2021, just before the asset soared to new all-time highs. He highlights the similarities in market fear and uncertainty that preceded Solana’s previous explosive rally. According to him, such fear-driven consolidation is often a signal of bullish patterns taking shape, with the potential for substantial gains once the market recovers. Mister Crypto refrains from setting a specific price target but suggests that Solana’s next major move could surpass its all-time high of $260. While the current mood remains cautious, his analysis provides hope that Solana may be preparing for another significant upward move, as historical patterns have shown similar price behavior before major surges. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Testing $0.34 Support – On-Chain Data Suggests Price Consolidation The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Solana as traders and investors wait to see if it will break out of its range or continue to face downside pressure. SOL Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $138, following a 9% retrace from its daily 200 moving average (MA) at $152. This drop marks a significant loss of momentum, as the price also fell below the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $140—a crucial support level. Losing the 200 EMA raises concerns for further downside potential in the coming weeks. For bulls to regain control, the price must reclaim the 200 MA and EMA, and push above the critical resistance level at $160. A surge above this threshold would indicate renewed bullish momentum and the potential for Solana to rally higher. However, if SOL fails to recover these key indicators, it could signal a deeper correction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential If the price continues to decline, traders may see SOL head toward lower demand zones around $110, a level that has acted as strong support in previous months. Investors and analysts are watching closely to see if Solana can hold its current levels or face more downside pressure in the near future. The next few days will be pivotal for SOL’s price action and overall market direction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503
RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Bitcoin Investors Accumulate Almost $1 Billion In BTC As Exchange Reserves Falls Towards New Lows,2024-10-10 17:00:19+00:00,"Although the Bitcoin price faces challenges in breaking out significantly from its support level of $60,000, recent on-chain data reveals a fascinating shift in sentiment among Bitcoin enthusiasts. Despite the ongoing price corrections, it appears that long-term holders remain undeterred. In fact, about 15,917 BTC, valued at approximately $987 million, has been withdrawn from various cryptocurrency exchanges over the past week. Bitcoin Exits Crypto Exchanges In Droves According to a previous report by NewsBTC, Bitcoin’s recent dip to $60,000 can largely be attributed to the actions of short-term holders. On-chain data reveals that this particular group of traders decided to exit their positions after Bitcoin’s performance failed to meet expectations in early October, further intensifying the selling pressure. However, long-term holders have taken full advantage of this increased selling pressure. Rather than follow the short-term market sentiment, many long-term investors seized the opportunity to add more Bitcoin to their portfolios. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 8,400% Rise For XRP Price To $44, Calls It ‘Conservative’ As data would have it, long-term holders seem to have capitalized on the selling pressure, with many of them taking the opportunity to add to their holdings. According to on-chain data highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Bitcoin reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have been in a steady decline since October 3. On that day, the total Bitcoin balance across exchanges stood at 2.5825 million BTC. What’s notable is that this figure was a result of several consecutive days of BTC inflows to exchanges, beginning on September 28 and continuing until October 3. During this time, the price of Bitcoin fell from $66,230 to $60,047, marking a decrease of about 9.3% as many traders sold on exchanges. However, in an interesting turn of events, long-term holders have seen this influx of BTC into exchanges as an opportunity to acquire more tokens. As a result, there has been a consistent decline in the total Bitcoin balance on exchanges since October 3. Numbers show that 15,917 BTC were withdrawn from exchanges between October 3 and the time of writing, bringing the total Bitcoin exchange reserve to about 2.5667 million BTC. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? The outflow of BTC from exchanges is generally seen as positive for the cryptocurrency’s price moving forward, as it reduces the amount of BTC available for sale. During this outflow period, Bitcoin retested the $64,000 price level on October 7. However, it has since reversed and is approaching the $60,000 price floor again. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,912, marking a 2.1% decline over the past 24 hours. This dip shows the importance of long-term holders and bullish investors continuing to accumulate BTC from exchanges. The onus now is on long-term holders to keep accumulating Bitcoin from exchanges in order to help prevent further price declines.

RSS,https://www.newsbtc.com/feed/,Explosive Growth: NEAR Protocol Caters To 3 Million Daily Users,2024-10-10 16:00:11+00:00,"As of Q3 2024, CryptoRank stated that 3 million addresses were active every day on NEAR Protocol, making it a major player in the blockchain world. This huge number is higher than both Tron (2 million daily active addresses) and Solana (2.4 million daily active addresses) during the same time period. Related Reading: $6 Million ETH Sale: Ethereum Foundation Joins Whale Liquidation Frenzy The growth of NEAR is in line with a larger trend in the AI cryptocurrency market. This shows that blockchain and AI are becoming more and more intertwined. This point of contact is driving more and more technological progress and user engagement across these channels. Surge In The AI-Cryptocurrency Sector One of the most important factors influencing user engagement on NEAR is the rapid growth in AI-related decentralized applications or dApps. As DappRadar reported, AI dApps increased by 70% compared with the previous quarter in Q3. The survey indicated that AI dApps garnered 4.3 million daily unique active wallets, illustrating the growing interest in this sector of the cryptocurrency industry. NEAR Protocol has swiftly leveraged this trend by establishing collaborations with major corporations such as Nvidia and Alibaba to augment its AI capabilities. With this further integration with AI, in addition to NEAR’s strong growing ecosystem, the network finds itself at the helm of innovation in this emerging blockchain landscape. Although the ecosystem is still experiencing positive growth, market sentiment remains cautious as the price of the protocol decreased by 2.36% to $4.87, along with a more than 30% decrease in trading volume. NEAR Protocol: Price Fluctuations Amid Market Ambiguity The current price difficulties of NEAR can be ascribed to overarching market conditions rather than the protocol’s intrinsic value. Despite the optimistic outlook suggested by daily active addresses and collaborations, recent data indicates a 0.4% reduction in NEAR’s circulating supply, now totaling 1.11 billion tokens. The protocol’s market capitalization now stands at $5.42 billion, ranking it 23rd overall in the market. Related Reading: Could XRP Finally Hit $1? Key Factors To Consider, According To Analysts Price Forecast Indicates Rebound Potential The medium-term prognosis for NEAR is predominantly favorable. Technical analysis forecasts an upward trend in the forthcoming seven days, with the token presently trading 220% beneath its projected value for the subsequent month. During a three-month interval, the price is anticipated to rise by 240%, indicative of favorable market sentiment and heightened adoption. Prolonged projections are similarly positive, with a six-month growth anticipated at 178% and a one-year projection indicating a 165% increase. Although short-term price fluctuations may indicate general market instability, the long-term prospects for NEAR are clear. Investors must keep tabs of forthcoming ecosystem advancements and AI trends to assess the protocol’s price trajectory. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Avark",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Long story short, the launch didn’t go well and the project didn’t take off at all. I am a noob in the field and I just ended up selling all my coins and called it a day after an hour. In between time, some random guy with a big account on twitter (<100k followers) reached to me via the twitter account I had made for the project. He asked me if I wanted to relaunch it with his support. He says he likes the meme and thinks it could do well (I tend to agree). He says he has a specific strat in place regarding the launch itself and that he can help promote and market the project for free and that he is ready to work for his bag. I am supposed to have a call with the guy tomorrow but what do you guys think of this? I find this approach a bit sus myself and would appreciate your opinion on this.

Reddit,solana,Phantom Wallet  - Alert to Users -,2024-10-10 23:09:49,"This is for the Phantom Wallet users.  My Phantom wallet was hacked and I believe I discovered a big hole in that wallet's security.

\*\* I'm alerting users that have a Phantom Wallet to change the password immediately to something unique (a new password never used before). Apparently, PW is more important than your ""seed words"".

I contacted Phantom about the hack, and their technical team responded with a ton of typical questions about where I shared my seed words, who I shared them with... They also try to insinuate in these questions that my computer was hacked and the seed words were stolen that way. My seed words were on a piece of paper in my safe.

What got me was that one question they ask: ""Where do you store the seed words where someone could access them?""  

My answer was the Phantom Wallet.  The wallet itself. 

Please correct me if I'm off on the science. If you know about Sol blockchain code, put it on the chopping block.   But I think I was able to piece together how this hack was done.

I narrowed it down to two things ---> 1. An Inside Job or 2. A Password Hole.

The Hack:  My wallet fell prey to that scam we've seen on reddit b4, where the wallet gets hacked and they drain any sol that's in the account or sent to it. All sol deposits immediately get resent to the hacker's wallet address.  Since the sol balance always stays empty, any tokens on that wallet are stuck forever (or until the hacker gets around to it).  Luckily I only lost about $40 on this wallet.

The Password Hole: Since my seed words are in cold storage, the only way to access the wallet was using the password login. What I discovered is you can access your seed words and your private key in the wallet's settings.  You just need to re-enter the password.

The Method: I have hypothesized that hackers are buying PW lists off the black market (these are those stolen password breaches we hear in the news frequently). They initiate a crawl algo that runs every stolen password against every SOL address in the blockchain.  All they need is your stolen pw and the wallet address. If a hacker crawls millions of addresses, it could add up quite a bit. That then allows them to add the automated botcode/extensions/scripts to the wallet.

Stealing my password was the only way this could have happened. It could have happened through a Dapp, which is a possibility. 

To protect myself from this, I do things a little different. I now disconnect when not in use. Once I do my business, I immediately disconnect and ""unallow"" the Dapp access in the phantom settings.

Is it normal to have access to your seed words from the digital wallet's settings? I dunno, Davey.

I told Phantom this. I asked them to look into removing the seed words from settings in the wallet.  I also told them I now anticipate a 50/50 chance of my Phantom wallet getting hacked. They haven't responded since.  I think they might've got offended by my possible ""inside job"" theory.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Here's the rest of the news...

### 📜 State of Solana: Breakpoint Edition

At Breakpoint 2024 the Solana Foundation released its first-ever **State of the Solana Ecosystem** report outlining major milestones and exciting developments.

Some of the highlights include:

**Institutional Adoption and Tokenization:** Solana is seeing accelerated adoption by institutional players, with new tokenization projects from Franklin Templeton, Securitize (partnering with BlackRock’s BUIDL), and Societe Generale. 

**Mobile App Development:** 2024 is a breakthrough year for mobile app development on Solana.

Major new mobile apps include:

* Jupiter: A leading DeFi aggregator expanding to mobile.
* DRiP: A social app built on Solana.
* PhotoFinish LIVE: A mobile-based horse racing game.

Solana’s mobile focus is also growing with the release of [Solana Mobile’s Seeker](https://blog.colosseum.org/solana-seeker-encode-bootcamp-worldid/) phone and Jambo’s JamboPhone. These devices and apps are creating opportunities for developers to build mobile-first experiences.

**Cross-Border Payments and Stablecoins:** The Solana payments ecosystem continues to expand, with launches such as Sling for cross-border payments, PayFi, and debit cards powered by Solana-based stablecoins.

**Decentralized Energy Sector (DePIN):** The DePIN sector is still growing on Solana, focusing on solutions for the energy crisis. 

Notable projects like Project Zero (a decentralized renewable energy network) and Powerledger migrating to Solana, highlight the intersection of blockchain and renewable energy. 

**Funding and Hackathons:** Solana projects raised $173 million in Q3 2024, the highest since Q2 2022, signaling a strong commitment to early-stage development. 

Additionally, participation in developer events like Colosseum’s hackathons has surged, with a 36% increase in registrations for the Radar hackathon compared to Arena. 

With increasing funding, hackathon participation, and new opportunities, Solana continues to give developers a dynamic ecosystem to build the future of Web3.

### 🖇️ Blinks Action Chaining

Dialect has rolled out new Blinks capabilities, including Action Chaining, Advanced Input Types, and Multichain Compatibility across major wallets like Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, OKX, ByBit, and more.

Action Chaining is the star feature of this update, letting developers create multi-step processes within a single Blink.

For example, you can now guide users through filling in shipping details, making a purchase, and entering a follow-up email, all in one streamlined flow.

Developers just need to add a next attribute in the links section of the *ActionPostResponse*. This small change unlocks the power to build complex user experiences across any app or service, such as voting on governance, making purchases, or engaging in DeFi actions anywhere the link is shared.

For more technical details and a step-by-step guide, check out [Dialect's documentation](https://docs.dialect.to/documentation/actions/actions/action-chaining?ref=blog.colosseum.org).

### 🌐 Spherenet

Sphere has unveiled Spherenet, a permissioned, privacy-focused distributed ledger built using a modified SVM.

It's designed to provide a bridge between traditional finance systems and blockchains for financial institutions that must comply with regulatory frameworks.

By integrating compliance features directly into its architecture, Spherenet allows developers to create DeFi solutions that meet stringent global financial regulations, including KYC and AML requirements.

Another advantage for developers is the ability to build privacy-preserving apps, thanks to Spherenet’s integration of ZK proofs and other cryptographic technologies.

Spherenet also provides integration of fiat funding through stablecoin bridging mechanisms, allowing developers to create solutions that facilitate cross-border payments and settlements, and fiat on/off ramps that work with traditional systems in a compliant way.

For DeFi developers looking to build applications that bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, Spherenet provides the regulatory compliance, privacy, and stability required to attract institutional users.

Reddit,solana,My crypto were stolen from my phantom wallet. Please help,2024-10-08 19:33:21,"Good afternoon community

A couple of hours ago today I had 36000 Hammy tokens stolen from a phantom wallet. I never interacted with any malicious site or signed contracts from strangers. I also never opened any scam nft. So I can't understand how I was robbed and I am afraid that I will be emptied of more accounts from the same seed phrase. Although I already moved most of my funds to binance. I think it might have been through TG since 3 hours ago I decided to invest in the NOW token. Going to the Pumpfun website. I saw among the comments that someone posted the TG link of a supposed CTO of the coin, so I opened it to take a look.

[That is the comment](https://preview.redd.it/hmtmhpa81ltd1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=08a76a8615a422e5cbfc388505b275997a6567fc)

When I opened it, it asked me to do a verification like most TG groups, with the difference that in this one it asked me to scan a QR code, I was stupid and scanned it and I didn't get into any group, so I forgot about it. Half an hour later I started to check my wallets and saw that I was missing 36000 Hammy tokens and I feared the worst...so I checked my transaction history and realized that indeed they had been stolen.I couldn't explain it because as I explained before I always avoid misusing my wallet. So I guess it had to be because of the qr code I scanned from TG. When I checked the sessions I realized from telegram that I had an open session on a device in Paris, France (I am from Mexico). So I guess that's how they managed to steal my tokens, since the theft happened a few minutes after I foolishly scanned that QR code.

[This is the unknown session in telegram. Opened a few minutes before the robbery](https://preview.redd.it/ofvdbbbj3ltd1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e5b615984c94348471949e0b73bbfd3e4d4f062)

I know it is impossible to recover the tokens. I just want to ask for help to know if the theft was as I believe it was done, or by some malicious software that slipped in without me realizing it. Right now I don't know whether to format my pc, delete my TG account. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

But really break it down like I’m 15 years old with a bad case of Brain rot

How would you look at who owns a large amount of the supply?

What percentage they own.

Reddit,solana,How to Trade Memecoins SUCCESSFULLY,2024-10-07 23:11:50,"So with every bull run there’s an influx here of newbies (and veterans) crying about losing their solana ports on memecoin trading. Wanted to make a post with some BASIC tips on how to be successful in this space. 

When you feel like everyone’s bags are pumping, and yours aren’t, it’s because:

1) You’re a low cap trader
You flip low caps all day. Most of the low cap coins are down bad the past couple of days. Also, if you’re doing this all thru Phantom or Solflare, you’re likely WAY too slow to make money on quick pump and dump low cap coins. You need to be using a bot (DM me for my ref link to the bot I use ;) )

2) You have no conviction bags
You don’t invest in long term holds / “cult” coins ie mini, manifest, tremp etc

What you should NOT do:

- chase green candles

Why the fuck would you chase mini at 30m when it was just at 12m mc - explain that to me

- dump ur current bags for the ones that are pumping

Just wait for a retrace

Anyway

Congrats if your bags are pumping

Reddit,solana,Profiting from copy traders,2024-10-05 12:55:54,"I was just thinking if it theoretically would be possible to profit from copy traders.

Wouldn’t it be possible to track which wallet someone is copy trading then find a way to buy the coin before the copy trader is buying so that you can sell it for more after the copy trader has bought? 

The way I would manage to buy before the copy trader is to have my own custom bot that is faster than the one many copy traders are buying on telegram. I would assume that because those telegram bots are built for the mass and not for only one person that they’re slower. 

I have knowledge in Rust which is one of the fastest programming languages. And I could write such a bot in Rust.
I doubt that the telegram copy trading bots are also using rust, as it’s way simpler to create a telegram bot with something like NodeJS or Python. 

I could find wallets that are being copy traded by just checking who bought the same coin a few seconds later. My goal would be to buy the same coin after the wallet that’s being copy traded but before the copy trader buys. Then once the copy trader buys I would instantly sell it, which should turn it into a profit. 

I have never bought any copy trading bot so if anyone of you has, it would be great if you could share some info with me.

summary ↓

an exploration of the commons scale goods that make Ethereum (network, asset, media), what underpins their integrity, and how [u/ProtocolGuild](https://x.com/ProtocolGuild) can help with that

Ethereum is a commons like the natural + digital ones that precede it: fisheries, forests, the internet, Linux, etc. Commons are productive systems which create resources for collective benefit

Ethereum's three shared resources: network, asset, media

their confluence produces what we call Ethereum mainnet: they are deeply interdependent here, but altered forms make the edges of the broader commons

these resources are produced through protocols: technical, legal, economic, social, political

complete ownership of each resource is not desirable, as it destroys their integrity. therefore, actors engage in production for influence extraction

1. narrow mandate
2. broad self-curation
3. members are individuals
4. 4yr onchain vesting contract
5. designed with time in mind

it holistically funds stewardship of the entire watershed - not rivers in isolation

Commons have had a rough go under capitalism - but there is hope in long-lived natural precedents: irrigation, fisheries, farming.

blossoming digital commons should practice the posture and develop the mechanisms necessary to ensure uncaptured longevity

Reddit,ethereum,What is the ethereum platform (in the context of purchasing goods on the internet) ,2024-10-10 18:26:32,"Hey guys, total newbie (although I am technically invested in ethereum lol) and I want to buy something on the internet that requires me to pay in ethereum, more specifically, from the “ethereum platform” itself. What does this mean? I paid via ethereum from

“Hello Sir, Ethereum is the main network for ETH and is independent of any platform. You should be able to pay from any wallet but choose the Network -> Ethereum. This means that the transaction will appear in ETH blockchain here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x466D0713Fb2aE827751402f68f81BA2F7d5Ec5F0”

These were the instructions, but I’m unclear as to how that’s not the same as me paying via ethereum on the coinbase app. Do I got to this website to make the transaction? He said I could pay from any wallet…

Fast forward he found a lawyer on facebook and the guy said he will help him out in return of 8% of the money he will get back. Same thing, he fooled him into investing into crypto, then he said he needed to invest another 1000$ because the money had to go into a mixer. My dad did. 

I got better and I did some research on this guy, he uses a fake name and a picture of a lawyer from canada but pretends he’s from the UK. 

Now he’s asking for another 1200$ for this mixer thing which I am sure is a scam. He left my dad broke and in debt and my dad is in a war zone, things are hard enough. 

I did some research but it is truly out of my area of expertise, I don’t know how trust wallet works, but I am not stupid.

The guy claims that revolut refused the money because they were dirty, but we were using my mom’s account which he couldn’t have had access to. So how would he know that? Except that it is a lie to scam my dad?

I am sure that the money that went into the mixer went into his wallet in fact. He also told my dad that he won 18000 $ somehow which is a far strech so he would invest more.

Reddit,ethereum,Plans to reduce block rewards or raise the the burn rate?,2024-10-08 06:00:30,"Hey all,
Since blobs got introduced and regular users moved to L2s, there are way lower gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem. Time to celebrate, right?
The downside of this is a constantly increasing ETH supply and the fear, that ETH isn't seen as a good investment anymore. I know that inflation of Bitcoin is still higher rn but Bitcoins supply is capped, while ETHs is infinite.

Imo it is important for ETH to be seen as a store of value (besides all it's functionality) to attract new users. There is also the risk of the old users slowly fading away, because they feel this spiral of: less new users > more supply > falling price.

I am interested in the thoughts and discussions around this topic from the community, but especially the devs pov.

Reddit,ethereum,"When using Groth16 on Ethereum through ᴇɪᴘ‒197, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-05 21:22:04,"First remember Ethereum only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result… Otherwise I recognize this is more a mathematical problem but the place where I’m the most likely to find someone who do understand it remains on Ethereum as it’s partly cryptocurrency math specific.

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ

# The first attack described in the tutorial I read and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

Reddit,ethereum,I got hacked and stolen $45K off my wallet,2024-10-04 07:37:30,"I’m a video editor/programmer who with another guy online started to develop an editing tool that we were planning on selling. We had already started developing the tool and I knew the guy enough to have some trust in him (nothing beyond online).

About 3 weeks ago, he sent me a version of the tool that he wanted me to test and I downloaded it on my computer which had the key to metamask wallet (I know it’s dumb I don’t need to be lectured about it I know). That’s how he managed to get it from there, keep in mind the ""version"" of the tool he made me download didn’t work it had an error when showing up which he said he would fix and send me another one when he does so I didn’t think any of it.

A few days passed by and he was starting to ghost me a little bit, but we were still communicating about the tool and I worked on it, until I got on my metamask wallet and saw my balance completely emptied (almost all the money I owned gone). I confronted him about it because I knew it could only be him at that point and he denied everything until he blocked me/deleted his discord account. I tried to look for every way to possibly get my money back but it’s gone and there is really nothing much I can do.

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep and I can’t go to school ever since I lost the money. I don’t know what I’m gonna do from there, I’m only 19 that’s a lot of money for me and I was supposed to go to University next year using a large chunk of that money but now all of that is gone.

EDIT: I will try to take legal actions but I really don't expect anything, as for the people saying I should have had a hardware wallet, I know. I also saw a lot of people claiming I was rich which is hilarious, I'm an immigrant from Senegal to Canada my parents are middle class workers (Accountant and Oceanographer) that struggled to give us good life opportunities so yes $45K is a lot of money.

**A Quarter of Anniversaries: 2 years since Merge and 1 Year with First Non-custodial Pooled ETH Staking Solution**

In the third quarter of this year, we celebrated a significant milestone: 2 years since Ethereum’s historic Merge.

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a PoS consensus mechanism, fundamentally transforming ETH's tokenomics. This monumental upgrade not only enhanced the deflationary attributes of Ethereum but also drastically reduced its carbon footprint, aligning the network's commitment to sustainable growth.

Following the Merge and Shapella, we observed a notable decrease in #ETH issuance alongside a remarkable increase in staking participation.

The Merge represents one of the most critical upgrades in Ethereum's roadmap, marking a pivotal step toward enhancing both sustainability and scalability within the ecosystem.

**The mid-September was marked by the 1st anniversary of the first non-custodial pooled ETH staking solution, powered by Everstake.**

As the transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism sparked widespread interest in staking, the requirement of **32 ETH** to launch a validator turned out to be a significant barrier for many potential participants.

Everstake has solved this issue by reducing the entry threshold by **320 times**, thereby enabling broader participation in staking activities. Our **non-custodial**, non-liquid staking solution allows users to engage in Ethereum staking with just **0.1 ETH**, and we take pride in being the first to facilitate this opportunity.

**Staking Dynamics and Slashing-Free Months**

Staking participation in the Ethereum network continues to grow, reflecting continued confidence among users. Staking metrics dashboard below shows a significant increase in the total amount of staked $ETH, underscoring the community's commitment to securing the network.

In August, we achieved a remarkable milestone, surpassing 34 million ETH staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Currently, there are 1.07 million active validators, with approximately 28.58% of the circulating supply staked.

https://preview.redd.it/27v4vnot7psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81a5affae875d471ec496c3bd7b0787ff164a91

At the end of July and early August, the validator entry queue was notably lengthy, likely driven by the surge of interest in Ethereum surrounding the ETF launch. Conversely, the exit queue remained consistently short, indicating a strong community sentiment toward active participation in staking.

https://preview.redd.it/od2439cw7psd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d6880c119f87aa378e87fddaed614d320d9345

As of now, Ethereum nodes are distributed across 89 countries, highlighting the global nature of the network. The countries with the highest number of Ethereum nodes are the United States with over 3k nodes (31.11%), Germany with 2k nodes (18.08%), Finland with 840 nodes (7.40%), France with 585 nodes (5.16%) and the United Kingdom with 415 nodes (3.66%).

This distribution reflects Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure and its widespread adoption, with Germany and Finland in top-3 thanks to their reliable data centers provided for operators across the world. For those interested in exploring Ethereum’s nodes distribution, check out more here:

In Q3, the Ethereum network experienced a notable stretch without any slashing events, lasting approximately 68 days in a row during the quarter. This achievement reflects the dedication of validators committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the network.

The last time we saw the same 50-day gap was in May, indicating a positive trend moving forward.

# Ethereum Spot ETF Inflows and Outflows Roller-coaster

On July 23, 2024, after receiving final approval from the SEC, 8 different spot Ethereum ETFs started trading.

It's been an up-and-down period with significant inflows and outflows. Since its launch, Ethereum ETFs saw total positive inflows of $2,383.5 billion, a notable indicator of interest and confidence in the asset.

Despite the positive inflows, ETHE has a substantial influence on the broader ETF landscape, with an overall net negative flow of $523.4 million. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an exchange-traded product distinct from its Mini Trust ETF. The market price of ETHE can differ from its net asset value, offering interested parties potential premiums or discounts on Ether holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/dqp5fvz28psd1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=d63704521e3ed7665d2e399890480a06172db182

At the beginning, we experienced significant daily outflows, but currently, we can admit the lower dynamic of outflows, highlighting a positive trend for its future growth. This is an encouraging sign for market participants, as fewer outflows reflect growing conviction and holding strength among users.

As for the key leader, BlackRock took the lead, driving $1,146.1 billion of the total inflows. Fidelity and Bitwise followed with $478.5M and $326.7M, respectively. These figures underscore the ongoing interest, signaling long-term belief in Ethereum’s value and utility. 

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart, but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management. He mentioned that for BlackRock, Bitcoin, and Ethereum offer complementary benefits rather than competing for the same role.

# Blobs and Gas Changes

It’s been over 6 months since EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, was successfully implemented on the Ethereum mainnet during the Dencun upgrade. At the end of Q3, the Ethereum network reached a significant milestone: **3 million blobs processed**, a testament to the steady progress of Ethereum’s data availability scaling.

https://preview.redd.it/372uelnb8psd1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc835534587fbd1627c3ab82729c45685120bc4

These figures highlight the effectiveness of Ethereum’s scaling efforts, particularly in how blobs are helping to ensure that Ethereum remains the preferred network for Layer 2 (L2), despite growing demand for data availability.

However, while these numbers are impressive, discussions in Q3 2024 have increasingly focused on scaling challenges and future improvements to meet the ever-growing demand from L2 networks.

During the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the conversation shifted toward Ethereum’s current blob capacity and whether it’s sufficient for the rapid growth of L2s. Base developer presented a proposal to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra 1 upgrade, arguing that the current 3 target blobs per block will soon be inadequate for future scaling needs.

Discussions around low gas and blobs’ impact on it did not subside, as well. But, it is worth mentioning that without the scaling benefits brought by blobs, activity may have shifted to other L1 networks, leading to a far worse scenario than Ethereum’s current challenges around reduced fees.

Although there’s currently an imbalance between rollup earnings and Ethereum, as L1, revenue, this is seen as a temporary issue. The Ethereum community anticipates that blobs will eventually realize its benefits to the fullest, revealing the true dynamics of the system once retail demand returns. With fees currently low, Ethereum remains accessible, and once demand increases, L2s will be prepared to fulfil this interest.

So, the discussions around blob are ongoing, with developers focused on finding the right balance between meeting scaling demands and maintaining network stability.

**Pectra Split**

In September, Ethereum Core Developers decided to split the upcoming Pectra upgrade into two phases due to developers limited capacity resources and several challenges to deliver a reliable state of the network post-upgrade that emerged during preparation. This will allow to bring the first phase of the upgrade as soon as possible to address current Ethereum issues. The decision was not an easy one—it was followed a period of intense and lengthy discussions surrounding the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to be included in Pectra, with the list undergoing multiple revisions along the way.

Upgrade scoping is usually the first bottleneck in the preparation. Every time core devs need to carefulyl balance between multiple priorities. On one side, they must take into account community and user expectations. On the other, they need to consider the developer capabilities of client teams and the long-term vision for Ethereum's development. This balance-boarding is particularly complex as different client teams may prioritize EIPs differently based on their technical readiness or implementation challenges.

Read more on why is deciding on the Ethereum upgrade scope so challenging:

🔗 [x.com/eth\_everstake/status/1839229193961246851](http://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1839229193961246851)

In Pectra, a prime example of this prioritization exercize is the EOF exclusion out of the Pectra phase one. Although highly anticipated by the community, at the end of the day EOF was not included due to its incomplete readiness for mainnet deployment, resulting in disappointment both across the community and client teams.

Developer Alex Stokes pointed out that excluding EOF from the first phase of Pectra would actually speed up the release of the 8 EIPs already in Pectra Devnet 3. By focusing on the more ""ready"" EIPs, developers can deliver improvements faster without compromising the overall timeline.

As the Pectra upgrade moves through its phased approach, these discussions underscore the intricacies involved in Ethereum's improvement and ensure that Ethereum continues to adapt to user needs while maintaining a robust technical foundation. 

The last months of 2024 will show us the final preparation process for the first part of the Pectra upgrade. Stay tuned!",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

In the case of the optimal ate pairing, this can happen if one of the point of the pairing is the point at infinity : then whatever is the other point in the key, the result will always be 1.  
For that reason, Zcash prevent the prover from fully controlling proof inputs and thus provide no encodings for the point at infinity.

On Ethereum, the prover often can set without filters A ; B ; C. And the only check in ᴇɪᴘ‑197 is points must be on curves and implementations just skip the compultation of bilinear parings containing a point at infinity : as long as the end result is 1 in $F_q¹²$, the contract call can succeed even with 1 or 3 points at infinity $(0,0)$

I mean I don't think this would work:

Encoding values based on the data type I think is present in the function and then simulating the transaction so that I don't spend money.

This could work to some extent if the data types don't share similar encoding rules. For example if the function is buyWETHwithUSDC(address, uint256, uint256, address) 

and I think that these data types are present buyWETHwithUSDC(uint256, uint256, address, address)

then I would parse an value of a token where the contract expects an address. But if I prarse an address where it expects an uint256, there isn't an issue as the parsed address can represent an number in uint256.

Reddit,ethereum,🌍🐍 Meet EtherSnek: The Cosmic Snake of the Ether 🐍🌍,2024-09-27 17:12:55,"Hey everyone! 👾✨

I was thinking about how to explain Ethereum and blockchain to kids, and it hit me: there's a giant world snake hanging out in the Ether! Let me introduce you to EtherSnek, who slithers through the tubes of the internet, quietly eating up data in a way that's fair and trusted by everyone.

Here's how it works:

EtherSnek lives in the digital ether, and every 14 seconds, he opens his mouth and consumes a blob of data—people’s transactions, smart contracts, anything important. Once he swallows it, he never forgets. It’s locked in his belly forever. And you can ask the snake, ""Hey, what did you eat for dinner?"" and he'll tell you the truth, every time, exactly the same way. This makes it so everyone can trust the snake. No one can trick or alter what he’s already eaten.

We all trust the snake because no one can make him lie. But to get him to eat your data, you need to pay a little bit of Ether—it’s like special snake food. And if you help keep EtherSnek strong by participating in the network, he’ll reward you with Ether. It’s like feeding the snake and getting back a sSnek ssnack in return! 🍽

EtherSnek is like the old piggy bank we used to have, but digital and alive. Instead of storing coins, he stores data blobs, and you can always trust that your data is safe. No one can steal it or change it. He’s constantly moving forward, consuming data at a steady rhythm, and no one can stop or slow him down.

This magical snek is how we know how much money everyone has, how smart contracts stay honest, and how trust is built in this digital world. The more we feed him, the more he grows, and the more secure Ethereum becomes. 🌍🐍

TL;DR: Ethereum is like a giant world snake (EtherSnek) that swallows data every 14 seconds and never forgets. You can trust the snake because no one can change what it's eaten, and it rewards you for helping keep it healthy!",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,ethereum,Can We Create a Sustainable Social Token for Artists?,2024-09-25 11:54:10,"**Disclaimer:**  
The following is based on my understanding from YouTube, ChatGPT, and other resources. If there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to correct and enlighten me. Also I used AI to restructured my Question to make it readable as English is not my first language. Thank You.

One of my friends is a fairly popular artist/singer on Instagram with around 30k followers. Recently, he needed funds to host a concert but didn't have the necessary resources. After brainstorming, I came up with an idea, and I’d like some input on its feasibility:

# Concept:

* **Create a Token**: We would create a token in my friend's name.
* **Hold 50% of Tokens**: We plan to keep around 50% of the tokens ourselves to prevent any major ""pump and dump"" scenarios.
* **Token Purchase by Fans**: Fans could buy the tokens, increasing their value over time.
* **Monetize Gradually**: Once the token price rises, we can sell or swap some of our tokens to fund the concert or other projects.
* **Provide Value to Fans**: To add stability and real value, we would offer physical merchandise, delivered to fans who hold the tokens.

# Challenges:

1. **Avoiding Pump and Dump**: I'm concerned about whales or large investors manipulating the token’s price. How can we prevent this?
2. **Not Promoting as Get-Rich-Quick**: We want to ensure this isn’t marketed as a way to ""get rich"" but more of a long-term investment in the artist.
3. **Legal Concerns (Securities)**: Since people are essentially investing in the artist, could this be considered a security? If so, what are the potential legal implications?

# Social Tokens:

* During my research, I came across the term **Social Tokens**, which seems to fit this concept. However, I noticed that they aren't very popular or stable.
* **Question**: Why haven’t social tokens gained more traction? Are there fundamental flaws in the concept?
* **Improvement**: Could we modify or recreate the idea with certain adjustments to make it more viable?

I have a detailed plan in mind, but I would love some insights or suggestions on how to proceed, particularly around the challenges mentioned above.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,ethereum,Does crypto arbitrage on dex even work?,2024-09-24 13:34:33,"I can not find a lot of tokens that are listed on multiple decentralized exchanges where I can make some lucrative money with.

First of all the ones I do find, have an price difference of around 1% like literall ALWAYS. Second of all, even if I do find tokens that are listed on multiple exchanges, the liquidity pools are a big problem. As on one exchange the pool has $100 million and on the other exchange $5 million. 

And with that 1% difference, there isn't an amount to arbitrage with that results in a profit. When the expenses are $200 for transaction fees, interest on the flash loan and the slippage I make for myself.

I want to know if I am missing something, or didn't notice something on Dexscreener as I just can't find any tokens that result in good profits (\~$50 per arbitrage opportunity)

As with exchange A having an pool of $100 million and B of $10 million, price difference is 1%, transaction fees are $150 and interest fee 0.09% (used to be in 2021 so today these are 100 times more when using Aave atleast) then with an loan of $41k I can make $38,19. 

And if we change the interest fee to what the current interest rates are on Aave, this profit is gone very fast.

Furthermore, Trump can use his favorite currency, USD, in the form of USDC. I know the end goal is to make ETH the main currency, but if the business want to receive USD, converting the amount to ETH just to convert it back to the expected amount of USD is pointless (just like the Trump video showed). It's great if the business want to receive ETH, the transaction fee would be lower too, but the current reality is most business will want to receive USDC over ETH.

I tried do demonstrate how much easier it would be to pay with USDC on Ethereum, but I couldn't find a self custodial wallet that can generates QR code of address, token (USDC), and amount. Most only has QR code for address. I think a good user experience would be, user only need to scan a QR code and click confirm, doesn't need to type anything.

# Current Situation or Status Praesens

On Ethereum, there are two main types of accounts: Contract Accounts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOA).

EOAs are regular user accounts. Every action on the blockchain requires a transaction, initiated and paid for by an EOA. EOAs are controlled by private keys, which are used to create a signature proving ownership of the account.

Contract accounts, however, are controlled by code instead of a private key. These accounts can’t initiate actions independently but can respond to transactions from EOAs. While they can’t directly pay for gas fees, they’re highly programmable and can perform a wide range of operations.

**Unfriendly Onboarding Experience**  
The true challenge of Web3 lies in its usability. Before users can even unlock the door to decentralized realms, they must first navigate a labyrinth of complexities, where each step presents a new hurdle. To use a dApp, one has to go through multiple steps, including creating a wallet, securing seed phrases, navigating exchanges, and paying gas fees. This complexity makes it challenging to engage seamlessly with Web3 applications.

**Poor Security**  
Relying solely on private keys for account access poses significant risks. If lost or stolen, access to both your account and funds is gone. Multi-signature smart contract wallets provide some security, but the default remains inflexible, leaving users vulnerable to theft or hacks.

**Requirement of ETH Balance**  
Ethereum transactions typically demand payment in ETH for gas fees. However, account abstraction allows gas fees to be paid with any ERC-20 token, making transactions more flexible and accessible. Additionally, anyone can cover gas fees for users’ transactions, removing the requirement for users to hold an ETH balance.

**Difficulty in Batching Transactions**  
In traditional EOAs, each transaction requires individual approval and authorization, which can be time-consuming, especially for frequent transactions like gaming. Account abstraction streamlines this process, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single authorization, making transactions smoother and more convenient.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how account abstraction addresses them and unlocks new possibilities in the world of cryptocurrency.

# The Solution — Account Abstraction (El Remedio)

Account abstraction, in essence, is about enhancing smart contract wallets to function more like traditional wallets but with additional flexibility and capabilities. In traditional setups, wallets such as Metamask enable users to send transactions directly to the blockchain. However, with account abstraction, there’s a blending of roles between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, making smart contract wallets more robust.

**User Perspective**  
From the users’ standpoint, account abstraction simplifies the intricate workings of Ethereum accounts. It enhances user security, mitigates the risk of loss/theft, and makes it easier and more intuitive for users to interact with dApps.  
By managing complexity behind the scenes, account abstraction makes blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly.

**Technical Setup in Ethereum & other EVMs**  
In Ethereum and other EVM chains, all blockchain activity must be initiated by an EOA, which limits the usability of smart contract accounts. **Native account abstraction** in newer protocols like zkSync and StarkNet removes this limitation (account abstraction at the protocol level).

ERC-4337 introduces account abstraction, transforming user accounts into smart contracts. This eliminates the need for managing private keys directly, enhancing security and usability.

Key features include:

* **User Operation Objects:** These encapsulate transaction details.
* **Bundlers:** External entities that aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency.

This decoupling of user intent from transaction execution simplifies user operations while maintaining decentralization.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works, particularly under the ERC-4337 standard:

**User Operations and the Alternative Mempool:** Instead of submitting traditional transactions, users create ‘user operations’ and submit them to an alternative Mempool. This allows for greater customization in how transactions are processed.

**Bundlers:** Bundlers validate and aggregate multiple user operations into a single transaction. They check for proper signatures and authorization before bundling operations, which reduces transaction costs and improves efficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/iegallxsxkpd1.png?width=2751&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb0b8618ebf50cb583ad8fddacc7bedd411d7b3

**Bundled Operations and the Contract Wallet:** Once bundled, these operations are sent to a contract wallet through a central contract known as the entry point (The entry point contract coordinates the validation of user operations, communication with the contract wallet, and interactions with bundlers and paymasters, maintaining the system’s integrity and smooth operation). The contract wallet receives and prepares to execute the bundled operations.

**Permissionless Bundling:** Anyone, including miners and validators, can become a bundler. This permissionless nature encourages decentralization and wider participation.

**Miners and Validators:** These actors participate in mining and validating the bundled user operations, ensuring security and integrity within the alternative Mempool.

**Execution and Payment:** Upon validation, the contract wallet executes the operations and handles payment, either in Ether or converted tokens. Some bundle transactions where gas is sponsored by 3rd party go via Paymaster (can sponsor gas fees, enabling dApps to cover users’ gas costs).

# Benefits of Account Abstraction (Beneficios)

**Enhanced Security:** With account abstraction, developers can introduce various options for account authentication and recovery, providing better security measures. Users can set spending limits, create whitelisted accounts, or freeze accounts as needed, adding layers of protection against potential threats. For example, you could set up a daily transaction limit to prevent large unauthorized transfers, establish recovery options for your account, or set rules for multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required before a transaction is processed.

**Walletless Web3 Logins:** With account abstraction, users can interact with dApps without needing a cryptocurrency wallet. Instead, they can authenticate using alternative methods such as social media accounts or email.

**Batching Transactions:** Account abstraction enables the bundling of multiple transactions into a single transaction. This feature is useful for executing multiple trades on a DEX and/or making batch payments.

**Automation:** AA opens avenues for automation and customization not possible with the current EOA system. Users can customize transactions and automate recurring payments, streamlining processes and improving efficiency. For example, you could set up a smart contract that automatically pays your rent or other recurring expenses on a specific date.

**Gas Fees:** dApps or smart contracts can be programmed to cover the gas fees for users’ transactions. This feature lowers the barrier to entry for new users. While sponsoring gas fees is helpful, it may not always be economically viable. Another option is to allow users to pay for gas fees using ERC20 tokens. This provides flexibility and convenience for users.

# Conclusion (Conclusie)

Account abstraction is a major advancement in simplifying blockchain and cryptocurrency. Replacing traditional wallets with smart contract wallets can offer a user experience as convenient and secure as Web2 applications while maintaining Web3 principles like self-custody and decentralization.

The use cases mentioned provide merely a glimpse of account abstraction’s potential. As this technology evolves and integrates more deeply into the blockchain ecosystem, new possibilities will emerge. This will lead to more sophisticated, user-friendly, and secure dApps, driving broader adoption and innovation.

Till then, stay safe with your keys & wallets!

Solo staking, where you stake your Ether independently (no staking pools, no third parties), isn't just about earning rewards—it’s about boosting decentralization and making the network more secure.

Vitalik explained how solo stakers help reduce the risks posed by centralized entities and protect Ethereum from potential 51% attacks. 

He also floated the idea of increasing Ethereum’s block finality threshold to make attacks even harder to pull off. 

Raising it from the current two-thirds to something like three-quarters or more could be a game-changer in keeping Ethereum resilient.

Are you staking solo? What’s your take on his proposal?

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Reddit,bitcoin,A bit frustrated right now.,2024-10-10 18:15:16,"Good news are not making effect, bad news are taking the price down.

Been patiently waiting and buying for 4 years since 2020. 

Finally we are supposed to be entering the phase where good news take the price upwards and bad news are somewhat ignored.

Quantitative easing and dovish fed approach, presidential candidate saying he will add Bitcoin to US strategic reserves, countries mining Bitcoin, money printing, faith in dollar declining. Still the price is doing nothing for 8 months, even doing lower highs.

But when Iran launches an attack, a bad CPI print, one government sells or has permission to sell, we instantly erase what took us weeks to recover.

When S&P 500 dumps, we dump accordingly, but when it pumps, we are left behind.

October is where previous cycles started to climb, yet here we are unable to pass 64k.

Hashrate is at ATH, ETFs been buying like crazy, all bitcoiners I know are HODLING. What I am missing?

I know elections puts uncertainty, but we are being so easily manipulated to the downside that it's quite frustrating.

Everyone is screaming ""we are about to"", ""are you ready?"", ""Soon"", ""last time we go under"".

How crazy I am to expect the ""Soon"" finally arrives?

I won't sell, I've been waiting for 4 years and willing to wait more, but anyone else is having this same frustration?

It's so obvious Bitcoin is the solution to our broken monetary system, yet the price doesn't reflect that. I don't even mind the US dollar parity, I'm talking about straight purchasing power, which today is around 55k in 2021 dollars.

How irrational can the market stay? Longer than everyone can stay solvent?

At the moment I realized the power that Bitcoin held. I was actually able to be my own bank, and take control of my own finances without having to ask anyone for permission to send or receive anything.

Reddit,bitcoin,Time in the market is better than timing the market ,2024-10-10 16:20:56,"I see videos of Plan B talking about how the best returns would have come from buying 6 months before the halving, selling 18 months after the halving, and then repeating that over and over again.

He claims doing this leads to far greater returns than just holding.

Here is why he is wrong and why holding is the superior strategy.

1) He doesnt take into account capital gains tax consequences from selling. When you sell you lose around 20% to 30% of all your gains on average depending on what country you live in.

2) Very smart investors have said after you take profits it becomes psychologically very hard to reinvest those profits back in again. No one wants to let go of profits they have locked in. This means most people would not be able to reinvest all the proceeds from selling their bitcoin, at best they might put half back in.

3) What happens when hyperbitcoinization and the bitcoin super cycle kicks in and there is no retracement? You would have sold what you thought was the top, but it kept on rising and you wont be able to make yourself buy back in at a higher price until its obvious the price is never going back down to where you sold, so to rebuy would mean getting half the bitcoin you once had.

For all these reasons combined simply holding is far more profitable than selling 18 months after the halving and rebuying again 6 months before the halving.

TLDR; at the end of the day you will have far more bitcoin if you just hold through all the volatility instead of trying to buy and sell based on the halving.

 But the website looked like a piracy website to me so I didn't trust it I thought my money would be gone. 

My only other option was to buy some second life videogame currency and convert them to bitcoin? But again the website looked like a 90's notepad written HTML page and it was 2013, so I thought it was a scam too. 

Looking back not transferring funds to mtgox was a wise choice, but I regret abandoning afterwards and not looking harder for ways to buy bitcoin.

 I really wanted bitcoin just to have an amount in my core wallet lol. I think I would have sold 50% in 2017 when it was at 10'000$ as I had already told myself back then if I was ever going to get bitcoins: ""I aint selling or using any of this unless it reaches 10'000$ and I will ALWAYS keep a stash.""

Reddit,bitcoin,EFTs vs Self Custody (They do serve a purpose even for BTC maxis),2024-10-10 15:43:32,"Some Pros and Cons


Buying BTC and withdrawing to hold your own keys -

Pros: anonymity, and free from censorship

Cons: selling for emergencies is a taxable event. (It will likely be decades before it is accepted more freely as currency and this changes)

Buying BTC ETFs via Roth IRA -

Pros: selling is not a taxable event

Cons: Max you can buy per year is $7k. If you need to sell for emergencies, any profits over that $7k per year are subject to penalties and taxes. (Unless you are 59 1/2 and the account is 5 years old)

Buying BTC EFTs via an investment account:

Pros: exposure to BTC, without risk of losing your keys. (Generally the best choice for: the elderly, people who have a hard time learning about technology in general, those who can’t grasp the concept of self custody, people who don’t care about censorship or anonymity, or believe that BTC will ever be treated as currency)

Cons: selling is a taxable event, and no pros of BTC self custody.

Buying BTC EFTs via a company 401k:

Pros: lowers your taxable income, so more to spend on self custody, and IRA. Heavily discounted DCA due to company match

Cons: no pros of BTC self custody, no pros of Roth IRA

My personal priority order:

Max 401K company match

Max IRA

Buy BTC and self custody.

Reddit,bitcoin,On the Importance of Running a Bitcoin Core Node,2024-10-09 11:02:58,"There’s a popular saying in the Bitcoin space: “Every Bitcoiner should aim to run their own Bitcoin node.”

It sounds cool, right? But what does that really mean, and why is it so important? Let’s dive in and break it down.

To truly understand why every Bitcoiner should run their own node, we need to rewind to the very essence of what Bitcoin is.

At its core, Bitcoin is a decentralized and secure digital ledger, known as the “blockchain.” The blockchain is like a record book that keeps track of every single Bitcoin transaction since inception.

Every 10 minutes approximately, new transactions get added to this blockchain.

Now, while Bitcoin is a lot more than just a ledger (there are miners, wallets, and all sorts of exciting tech behind it), at its heart, Bitcoin is really about **decentralization and security**.

Ans where is this ledger actually stored? You guessed it—**in the Bitcoin nodes.** Every Bitcoin node runs an exact replica of the blockchain. The more Bitcoin nodes there are, the more decentralized and secure the Bitcoin network becomes. In other words, **every node makes Bitcoin stronger.**

Now, you might be thinking: ""That sounds pretty important... but isn’t running a node super hard?""

Actually, **running a Bitcoin node is easier than you think!** Here’s why:

1. **You don’t need fancy hardware**: You can run a Bitcoin node on a simple computer or even a Raspberry Pi. If it can browse the web, it can probably run a node.
2. **No need to be a tech wizard**: There’s plenty of user-friendly software out there that guides you step-by-step. If you’ve ever installed an app, you’ve got this!
3. **It’s a hands-off process**: Once you’ve got your node set up, it runs quietly in the background, doing its thing while you live your life.
4. **You stay in control**: When you run a node, you’re verifying transactions directly from the source. You don’t have to trust anyone else’s copy of the blockchain. It’s like having VIP access to the Bitcoin ledger—no middlemen, no nonsense.
5. **Support the network**: Every node you run contributes to the overall health of the Bitcoin ecosystem. You’re actively helping to keep Bitcoin censorship-resistant, decentralized, and thriving for everyone. **You’re literally a part of Bitcoin’s backbone!**

And let’s not forget the bragging rights. Being able to say “I run my own Bitcoin node” is like telling people you built your own house, but in the digital world.

Running a Bitcoin core node isn’t just for hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts—it’s for anyone who cares about decentralization, privacy, and keeping Bitcoin true to its roots. Plus, it’s easier and more fun than you might think. So why not take the plunge and become a part of the Bitcoin revolution?

Glassnode data reveals reserves have plummeted to about 2.58 million BTC, a level unseen since 2018. This trend coincides with Bitcoin's price doubling this year, prompting questions about the rationale behind this movement.

Analysts speculate that investors are increasingly transferring their assets off exchanges to safeguard their crypto holdings instead of selling. This shift hints at a growing expectation of a substantial price upswing and a desire to protect against centralized platform volatility.

The ongoing outflows of Bitcoin from exchanges not only hint at a potential surge in demand but also underscore a broader transition towards off-exchange transactions. This shift reflects a changing mindset among Bitcoin holders, prioritizing autonomy and secure asset management in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.

So what im trying to do now, is to buy mining equipment that is really not expensive, not profitable in my area, and I want to set them up in Argentina/Paraguay, where they would be doing really well because of the cheap electricity rates.

Right now I think the electricity rates in Argentina/Paraguay are about 0.038 cents/kwh, and I have a supplier who can provide me with some s17+. He can do about 4500$ for about 120 units. With that electricity rate, each unit would make about 1400$ a year. Of course the shipping fee would be be high between 3000-6000 according to what I've seen. And there are a lot more expenses such as rent, etc.

But for the profit,  with a rate of 0.04c each miner would make approximately 1000$ a year. For 120 miners, the annual net profit, not gross, would be around 110 000$. 

So I need your guy's advice on my idea. I'm pretty excited which I understand can make me see things not clearly. I need some ideas on where I could run the miners. Should I host them, should I build a shed and run it there, should I rent a storage room and run them there, I don't know any idea is appreciated. I also need help with customs, if some people have experience with mining in other countries, what do I have to do to be able to do this legally in Argentina or Paraguay. 

Thank you very much for those who read the whole thing. The idea is still just in development so please understand that a lot of details are probably going to be missing.

  
Right now, my biggest questions are what can I do to run them over there. And how can I feel with customs (Do I have to register my business in the country, do I need a tax ID, etc).

Every idea is helpful. Please leave a message if you can, I'm taking every suggestion.

Translated to english:



Pays daily wages in bitcoin: ""Why do we only get paid once a month?""



The developers wanted to test a new salary model. Now employees can choose to receive wages daily—in bitcoin. ""A tax risk,"" says a BI professor.



Salary models in Norwegian companies are relatively standardized today.



You do your job, and you get your salary deposited into your account once a month.



Now, the developers at the IT consulting company Snøkam are testing a new model they believe is fairer for employees.



“Why should you be paid for work you did three weeks ago?” asks senior consultant Simen Johnsrud.



The new model allows employees who wish to receive part of their monthly salary daily, in bitcoin, based on how many hours they worked that day.



Here’s how the arrangement works:



Employees can choose a percentage of their total monthly salary to be paid out daily throughout the month, instead of receiving the entire amount at the end of the month as usual.

The daily amount to be paid to the employees' accounts is converted into bitcoin before being sent.



“We asked ourselves: ‘Why do we only get paid once a month?’ and we couldn’t find any good answers—quite the opposite. It’s just always been that way, and it’s tailored to current routines,” says Johnsrud.



“One answer might be that running payroll has typically been a large manual process. We want to spend as little time as possible on manual tasks, so we’ve implemented automation wherever possible,” he adds.



Johnsrud provides an example to better explain the model.



“If an employee in the company earns 20,000 kroner a month, and there are 20 working days in the month, they will earn 1,000 kroner per day. If they choose to get 10% paid in bitcoin, that amounts to 100 kroner a day.”



Currently, seven out of eleven employees at the company have chosen to receive part of their salary in this way.



For now, Snøkam has set a maximum limit of 10% that can be paid out daily while testing the model. However, they aim to increase the limit over time.



The average percentage chosen so far is around 8%.



A bit ""unfair""



""But doesn't this just create a lot of hassle in accounting and more work than necessary for payroll?""



""As consultants, we work by the hour, so it’s very easy to see what our daily wage should be when we go home for the day. It’s also a bit 'unfair' for the employee that the company can withhold wages and earn money from it, as opposed to paying immediately for the work that’s been done. From that theory to payout in practice, the transition was not difficult for us,” says Johnsrud.



He explains that the daily amounts are automatically registered as an advance payment on the payslip.



At the end of the month, the advance payments are summed up and subtracted from the total amount.



“These amounts are deducted from what we calculate to be the employee’s exact monthly salary, so there are no errors, either in taxes or in the paid salary. The monthly reconciliation becomes the control for the entire system,” Johnsrud explains.



“So why pay out part of the salary in bitcoin?”



“Some of us are interested in crypto and wanted to explore the advantages of paying daily wages in bitcoin versus a regular payroll system,” he says.



Bitcoin is known for being a risky investment because its prices fluctuate greatly. As a result, many well-known investors and fund managers have warned against investing in cryptocurrency.



What do you and the other employees think about the volatility of bitcoin prices?



“As long as you can choose the risk you want to take by adjusting the daily rate, it’s easier to accept a fluctuating rate,” Johnsrud says.



“It’s completely voluntary for employees to participate in the bitcoin arrangement or not. We also understand the issue with paying 100% of wages in bitcoin, since it can’t be used everywhere. So, it’s good that you can choose how much you want to commit,” he adds.



A tax risk



Espen Ekberg is a professor of economic history at BI Norwegian Business School.



“This is interesting, and they are free to create the payroll system they want, but it’s strange that the company wants to pay wages in bitcoin. A common definition of salary is that the employee receives compensation in money, and bitcoin cannot be considered money. It could become that, but it doesn’t have this function today,” he says.



“Money should be used as a medium of exchange and must hold value well. The basic premise of a salary is that your labor should be worth a certain amount of purchasing power, and it shouldn’t depreciate too much over time,” he says.



Ekberg also points to a tax risk for employees who opt into the scheme:



“Those who have agreed to this will never know exactly how much bitcoin they will receive each week. But they still have to pay taxes based on their salary in kroner. If you have a salary of 800,000 kroner, and 10% is paid in bitcoin, you still have to pay taxes based on the 800,000 kroner. Therefore, there’s a clear risk if the bitcoin rate fluctuates significantly,” he says.



“Some people like risk and enjoy playing with it, but I don’t quite understand the reason for trying this. It’s very strange,” Ekberg adds.



He also notes that salary hasn’t always been paid monthly.



“You don’t have to go far to find completely different systems. In the U.S., for example, bi-weekly payments are quite normal. In Norway, we’ve also had different salary systems. Monthly payments became common when banks started offering salary accounts in the 1960s. Before that, wages were often paid weekly, in cash,” the professor adds.



“So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin”



Aksel Øvern is the CEO of Snøkam and also works as a consultant.



“Would it have been possible to do this with regular Norwegian kroner? That is, pay salaries as normal, but daily instead of monthly?”



“Payments in Norwegian kroner have some limitations since they go through the traditional banking system. First and foremost, these transactions require signing with BankID in our accounting system, which would have made this solution practically impossible. Our finance manager would have had to sign every single daily transaction for every employee with BankID,” Øvern responds.



“The traditional banking system would also have significantly limited this solution due to long transaction times, depending on the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays. The transactions we do today with bitcoin are received within a minute after the consultant logs their hours. This works regardless of the time of day, working hours, weekends, and holidays,” Øvern continues.



Now, he and Johnsrud hope that the arrangement will catch on, and that more restaurants and shops in the capital will begin to accept the volatile cryptocurrency as a means of payment.



“What each employee does with their bitcoins once they’re in their account will be interesting. We believe, and hope, that the adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrency over time will allow us to use these currencies for daily expenses in Norway. So far, we’ve found one café in Oslo that accepts bitcoin. Fortunately, it’s located right by our office at Nationaltheatret,” says Øvern.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503
Reddit,bitcoin,The Global Race for Bitcoin,2024-10-10 11:41:31,"One of the most interesting aspects Bitcoin is the game theory.

Thanks to its unique characteristics (scarcity, decentralization, security, divisibility, portability, fungibility, transparency and more) Bitcoin is without a doubt a superior form of money. In fact, it is far superior to the fiat currencies we use today. Yet, because it is still new, only a small portion of global population has adopted it. 

That's where game theory comes in: Every entity in the society (individual, family, communities, institutions, private companies, corporate, public sector, nation state) must make a choice: Shall I bet on that new form of money or rather stick with the current one?

Individuals and entities choosing not to move run the risk of being left behind. Those who decide to move will enjoy the benefits of being early but also need to consider the risk (even if small) of Bitcoin being abandoned at some point for whatever reason.

What's more, financial institutions that we'd expect to reject Bitcoin the most because of their privileged position, now have to carefully evaluate the risk of Bitcoin winning and them losing by joining too late. Could that explain the confusing messages we seem to be getting: On some TV channels we hear Blackrock's CEO selling the unique merits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand we hear Jamie Dimon dismissing Bitcoin as a 'pet rock' that does nothing. Are these two really in disagreement or are they playing their own version of the game to confuse the populace while planning on getting as many Bitcoin as possible?

Reddit,bitcoin,Why not Peter Todd?,2024-10-09 03:16:54,"Peter Todd, a well-known Bitcoin developer and cryptographer, isn’t Satoshi Nakamoto for a few reasons, even though some people have speculated. Here’s a few key points:

	1.	Peter Todd’s timeline: Todd got involved in the Bitcoin community around 2011, which is after Satoshi had already disappeared (Satoshi stopped being active in 2010). Todd himself has confirmed this timeline and never claimed to be involved in creating Bitcoin.
	2.	Different communication styles: Satoshi’s writing style and approach to Bitcoin’s design is different from Todd’s. Satoshi was really focused on decentralization, while Todd has been more involved in discussions about improving Bitcoin’s privacy and scalability, but from a more pragmatic standpoint.
	3.	Public statements: Todd has always denied being Satoshi and said that it wouldn’t make sense for him to hide his identity if he was, considering how open he’s been in the Bitcoin world.
	4.	Technical focus: While both are skilled in cryptography, Todd’s work has mainly focused on specific improvements to Bitcoin, like time-stamping services and fixing transaction malleability, rather than creating the network itself.

These factors, along with what Todd has said himself, makes it clear he isn’t Satoshi Nakamoto.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

For each wallet meeting this criterion, I want to find/fetch details of the wallet address, date/time of the transactions, and transaction information i.e. BTC amount, price, purchase or sale. The deliverable should be an Excel file capturing this information.

I am aware of two approaches to this problem. The first using prebuilt APIs which will return a specific, filtered dataset. The second approach using AWS infrastructure services to access, process, and query blockchain data without needing the third-party APIs.

I ruled out the API-based approach because it offers limited flexibility (can’t fully customize the dataset to meet all the requirements) and is also expensive.

So I went with the second one but while querying, I got stuck because of export failing due to the large data set. The data set is large since the query returned over 15 million rows (entries) because of duplication. A wallet which has completed say 18 transactions (meets criterion/falls within the 5 and 20 txs range) appears 18 times in the dataset. As a result of each transaction from the qualifying wallets being counted as a separate row, the query returned over 15 million entries.

How can I go about this or is there another approach that would be more suited to the problem?

Anyway got an old wallet.dat from maybe 2013 and I'm currently syncing an old version of bitcoin core to check it.

My question I need help with is, if there is BTC on there, what will be the easiest way to get it from the old bitcoin core across to my trezor wallet?

Will I just simply enter my trezor receive address into bitcoin core? Or is there a safer method of me updating and sending it via QR code? Because the old core is just typed by hand by the looks of it.

Any tips and advice on moving it without a mistake will be much appreciated!

Reddit,bitcoin,How much bitcoin to be in the 0.1% in the world?,2024-10-09 05:27:02,"TLDR; According to GPT O1, assuming a Gaussian distribution, you need 0.0105 BTC to be in the top 0.1%. However, if we add other ""more realistic"" assumptions on distribution, you need 10 BTC to be in the top 0.1%

  
EDIT: if anyone is interested in multiple scenarios here's the analysis on perplexity : [https://www.perplexity.ai/page/how-much-bitcoin-for-1-r\_ZEIVE8Rpinv.8PqCxvjQ](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/how-much-bitcoin-for-1-r_ZEIVE8Rpinv.8PqCxvjQ)

-----Details below-----

To determine how much Bitcoin you need to hold to be in the top 0.1%, 1%, and 10% of Bitcoin holders globally, we can model the distribution of Bitcoin holdings using a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on the given assumptions:

# Assumptions

* **Total Bitcoin Supply:** 21,000,000 BTC
* **World Population:** 8,000,000,000 people
* **Distribution Model:** Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

# Calculating the Mean Holding

First, calculate the average (mean) Bitcoin holding per person:

Mean(μ)=Total Bitcoin/World Population=0.002625 BTC per person

# Determining the Standard Deviation

In a Gaussian distribution, the mean and standard deviation (σ) define the spread of the data. However, the total Bitcoin supply constrains the distribution. For simplicity, we'll assume that the standard deviation is equal to the mean:σ=μ=0.002625 BTC*σ*=*μ*=0.002625 BTC *Note: This is a simplification. In reality, Bitcoin holdings are likely more skewed, but for the purpose of this calculation, we proceed with this assumption.*

# Calculating Bitcoin Holdings for Top Percentiles

Using the properties of the normal distribution, we can determine the Bitcoin holdings required to be in the top 0.1%, 1%, and 10%.

# Top 0.1%

* **Z-score for 99.9th Percentile:** ≈ 3.09
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(3.09×0.002625)≈0.0105 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(3.09×0.002625)≈0.0105 BTC

# Top 1%

* **Z-score for 99th Percentile:** ≈ 2.326
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(2.326×0.002625)≈0.0087 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(2.326×0.002625)≈0.0087 BTC

# Top 10%

* **Z-score for 90th Percentile:** ≈ 1.282
* **Required Holdings:**

x=μ+zσ=0.002625+(1.282×0.002625)≈0.00599 BTC *x*=*μ*+*zσ*=0.002625+(1.282×0.002625)≈0.00599 BTC

# Summary of Required Bitcoin Holdings

|**Top Percentile**|**Z-score**|**Bitcoin Needed**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Top 0.1%|3.09|≈ 0.0105 BTC|
|Top 1%|2.326|≈ 0.0087 BTC|
|Top 10%|1.282|≈ 0.0060 BTC|

# Conclusion

Under the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of Bitcoin holdings across the global population:

* **To be in the top 0.1%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0105 BTC**.
* **To be in the top 1%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0087 BTC**.
* **To be in the top 10%,** you need to hold approximately **0.0060 BTC**.

# A more realistic model:

Given the skewed distribution, the Bitcoin needed to be in specific percentiles increases significantly compared to the Gaussian model.

* **Top 0.1%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 10 BTC
* **Top 1%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 1.133 BTC
* **Top 10%:**
   * **Estimated Holdings:** ≈ 0.1 BTC",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503
Reddit,bitcoin,What is better than finding forgotten money in your clothes? ,2024-10-08 19:37:01,"Finding forgotten bitcoin in a wallet, of course! 

Some years ago I used a lightning wallet to make some payments, so I had to deposit some sats from an on-chain wallet. I knew that there were still some 300000 sats there. But when I decided to withdraw it yesterday, I noticed there was a ZZZZ symbol below the available balance (it was a Phoenix wallet).

When I clicked it, the app told there were unspent bitcoin that were on standby, because I took too long to use it. So I transferred the 300000 and discovered later that the unspent were 380000 sats.

So yesterday was a pretty good day! ",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

I once unburdened here in a point of my life when I was feeling down while seeing no bright future ahead. I separated from my ex, my wage was miserable, my rent was crazy. And I was like, ""should I just put X savings into btc?"" in hopes I would get richer in a few years because I was sick of being poor.

The best advice people gave me was as simple as this: ""better yourself and make yourself more valuable"" because just diving in BTC without a plan just isn't enough.

I started investing in myself. For the last 2 or 3 years I exercised more, I took a course, I ate better, I got more and more valuable in my job to the point of getting promotions and making my bosses tremble whenever I mention leaving. I found a cheaper rent and I found a new woman who loves me and understands boundaries.

Since the start of COVID I believe the entire economy will now be in a perpetual state of inflation. This means the rich will truly get richer while the poorer get poorer.

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,HUG Giveaway!!! - The Leading Meme Coin on Radix - Oct 9th,2024-10-08 17:02:34,"**What is HUG?**

HUG is the number one meme coin, and most traded asset on Radix. It’s a movement of positivity in the crypto world with one goal in mind, to spread good vibes, community, and generosity in a space often dominated by FUD, red candles, and wallet drains. HUG aims to fill the void left by the aggressive degen culture, it is designed to be a sustainable and decentralized project, powered by the people, for the people, built on the cutting-edge Radix tech.

**Why HUG on Radix?**

Radix is fast, secure, and scalable – everything a top meme coin needs! It's designed to change how we use decentralized apps with a user-friendly experience that makes interactions smooth and simple. Radix is highly secure, with its simple transaction manifest, you can say goodbye to wallet drains forever.

By being the number one meme coin on Radix, HUG is positioned for success. Just like $BONK and $BRETT, being the top meme coin on a leading network can bring immense recognition and growth. As Radix gains momentum, HUG will lead the charge, spreading positivity and generosity throughout the crypto world.

**Why HUG at all?**

Meme Coins Are the Gateway - The top meme coins on any chain outperform other projects. They’re not just about fun, they’re powerful tools for onboarding new users into the ecosystem. Positive Vibes Narrative - The ethos of ""HUG department always open"" fits perfectly into the Matt Fury meta and was taken from a custom line drawing by Matt. Why are we always open? Because there is always someone that needs a HUG, and the HUG community wants to be there to give it to them. Unique Distribution Mechanism Proof-of-HUG (POH) is HUG's innovative distribution mechanism that ensures a sustainable revenue model using devices like our validator, and trade bot to generate fees. With more than 2/3 of its liquidity provided by over 2,000 community wallets, HUG is truly powered by the people!

**HUG's Goals**

Our aim is not just to be the top meme coin on Radix but to compete with the biggest memes in all of Web 3.0. Our marketing is geared towards making HUG a household name, and with community support, we will achieve this together. Our decentralized ownership, universal message, and recognition as Radix's top asset positions us to be a top-performing meme coin by the end of this cycle. We're already a strong contender, but we want our market cap to reflect our standing against main competitors.

**Giveaway**

There will be a HUGe giveaway of $500 $HUG to 20 participants in this AMA. Simply ask your question in this thread and the top 20 questions will be selected to win $25 of $HUG each.

Many of these tokens are valued at billions in market cap despite having no real users, reminds me of the metaverse land craze that featured projects with just 20 active users yet sky high valuations.

If this crypto is sent to a regulated exchange, they will generally freeze and eventually seize it.

Down the line, this crypto is either returned to the victim, or siezed and auctioned by the relevant government.  In both cases, the crypto is then un-tainted, and ""clean"" again. The laundry cycle is complete.

Does anyone know if there's some sort of federated chain analysis out there that shows how much of each is happening by day? Id imagine the pool of tainted crypto is growing as a percentage of the total, but curious how fast, and by what coins.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,PolyMarket bettors are heading to TrustPilot to claim the site is a scam platform. ,2024-10-10 00:31:03,"After losing a ""sure"" bet, Polymarket Bettors are angry and claiming they were scammed. Without much they can do in terms of action against Polymarket they've decided the next step is to try and Nuke Polymarkets online reputation.

To that end they've taken to TrustPilot to sabotage the rating for the company.

https://preview.redd.it/wikw4fouittd1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=f66edd06807beb47cec117b8d71d409be11f0452

# What Happened?

Polymarket hosted a Market with the title: Will Israel invade Lebanon in September? Well on the night of September 30th (US Time) Israel decided to invade Lebanon for a series of ""operations"" to push Hezbollah away from the border.

https://preview.redd.it/a26nmnd1kttd1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f87c0da486804c8448836a96359357b2a3fed76

Although the exact wording of ""Invasion"" was widespread across news outlets, **this market would ultimately resolve to no.**

# Wait, what it resolved to no? Why?

The reason it resolved no is probably up for dispute but it likely is a result of the market not ""technically"" meeting the created ""Rules"".

https://preview.redd.it/70qn49dkkttd1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c76ce668361c977b91c2dd1bb31cccc24273ad

Although the market certainly met the title requirements for ""yes"". No bettors argued that although Israel sent soldiers into Lebanon they didn't announce that they wanted to take control of any part of ""Lebanon"". So the market ""should result in No"".

# The Dispute and UMA:

UMA calls itself a 'Decentralized Truth Machine', among the many things UMA does for Polymarket one of their most notorious functions is handling Polymarket disputes. The simplified version of how it works is:

1. A dispute occurs.
2. Users make arguments on the UMA discord for why they think the market should resolve a certain way.
3. UMA Token Holders stake their tokens and vote on what the outcome of the dispute should be.
4. Some time later votes are revealed and the resolution most in favor is the Disputed Resolution.

Ignoring all obvious problems with this system like: UMA Holders being incentivized to vote for the outcome that financially favors them, and large UMA Holders being able to trade the market knowing how it will likely resolve.

The biggest and most glaring flaw in the system is the centralization of UMA tokenholders. In fact just two people at UMA control enough of the stake to lock down any dispute (if they are in agreement). **Of course this sounds like a glaring red flag so these two holders have as a result divided their tokens between a number of wallets to make voting ""appear more decentralized"".**

# The Israel/Lebanon Dispute.

In the Israel Lebanon Dispute although a majority of unique voters thought that the market should result to \[YES\].  The two UMA whales and a number of other smaller voters thought the market should result to \[NO\].

As a result the market: 'Will Israel invade Lebanon in September?' ended in \[NO\] and all \[YES\] Voters ended up losing their ""sure bet"".

The biggest individual loser was someone new to Polymarket who poured \~$420K onto the platform thinking the bet was all but guaranteed.

# The Aftermath

Beyond the immediate reaction of bettors nuking the Polymarket TrustPilot score. Losing bettors from the market are claiming that the Polymarket CEO committed a crime and deserves to be prosecuted.

Will anything else happen? Probably not... given this is just one of many controversial markets on the platform. Given a week or two this market like the rest will probably be forgotten, and news entities will continue to present Polymarket odds like the numbers are somehow a valid representation of real world odds.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Celsius lawyers are raking it in at the expense of their creditors: they are going after contractors,2024-10-09 18:03:12,"This is probably a shot in the dark.

It has been known that Celsius is pursuing users that happened to withdraw months prior to collapse, in several lawsuits that have no chance of recovering more than the cost of the legal representation of their customers.

I will provide a little more to this story. I used to work for Celsius as a contractor, a SWE. I have been slapped with a lawsuit that is laughable. They are literally full of shit, claiming that me, as a contractor, aided in the catastrophic deployment of capital that led to its demise. That my salary was unjust enrichment because I provided nothing of value back to Celsius 's creditors. I caught wind that they are also going after other entities like Uniswap for enabling pools that allowed to lose money.

Like if I ever had any kind of access to the private keys that these dumbfucks loaded in their Metamask wallets to participate in the Stakehound fiasco, the participation in liquidity mining ponzis, purchase of shitty NFT art at Opensea, or buy CEL to pump the price.

Let me tell you one thing, if by any chance you are a Celsius lawyer: good luck reaching out to this jurisdiction. I might be banned from USA for life, but you are not recovering one penny from the below-average salary I was earning. I invoiced everything and paid my income tax, and I have all the source code of the projects that I owned, along with their conversations surrounding the development.

If you are a Celsius creditor, you should know what they are doing with what is left of your money: legal theft. There is not a chance in hell that the amount of fees they are earning is going to be less than a sad contractor salary. Just 1 hour of their time is more than 30 times mine. They are screwing you and you should stop them from taking from the little that was left in this disaster.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Tibia, one of the oldest MMORPGs in the world, will allow players to trade in-game gold for crypto",2024-10-09 10:05:32,"CipSoft, the developer of the classic MMORPG Tibia, has announced an upcoming feature that introduces Tibia Tokens (TIB), a new digital token for trading in-game currency. **Tibia, launched in 1997, is one of the longest-running online multiplayer games.**

Tibia Tokens (TIB) can be obtained by converting Tibia Coins, an in-game currency, through the Tibia Token Exchange. **Built on the BNB Smart Chain and following the ERC20 standard**, Tibia Tokens are compatible with many digital wallets, like MetaMask and applications. This feature opens up a unique opportunity for Tibia players to engage with blockchain technology, blending the lines between virtual and real-world economies. 

While Tibia may not have the massive player count of games like World of Warcraft, it has maintained a dedicated player base with around 10,000 to 20,000 daily active players. Therefore, this might indicate an important step for the gaming and cryptocurrency industries, showing the potential of game economies to integrate with digital asset platforms.

The source for this news is the official website of the game: [https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews](https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews)",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503
Reddit,CryptoCurrency,"Live (free) crypto rates for Google Sheets and Excel, now with API access for any app",2024-10-09 11:53:25,"Nearly 3 years ago [I made a free tool](https://cryptorates.ai/) for r\/cryptocurrency to get live crypto rates into Google Sheets and Excel, without needing to use Javascript and without any rate limits.

This service is still going strong and I've made some big improvements recently:

- Includes the data for the top 5000 coins by 24-hour volume.
- Prices are now updated every 5 minutes.
- I have [added API access](https://cryptorates.ai/api/docs) so you can use this in any application; it doesn't need to be only in Google Sheets / Excel.
- All-time high and low have been added to the dataset along with some other useful columns.
- **And most importantly: no rate limits!** You can fetch from this service as much as you like. I make heavy use of Cloudflare's free caching functionality, so the load on my server is very minimal. Cloudflare does the heavy lifting for me.

To get any rate into Google Sheets is as simple as copying and pasting this formula; for example to get the rate of PancakeSwap:

    =QUERY(IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/files/standard.csv"", 
    "","", ""en_US""), ""SELECT Col3 WHERE Col1 = 'CAKE'"", 0)

Just change `CAKE` to the coin of your choice or use a cell reference. 

If you want you can reference a rate directly like this, however the above method is better for multiple rates: `=IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/v1/price/BTC"")`

You can see in this animation how once you've fetched the rate for one coin, all the other coins will have their rate instantly appear without any *""Loading…""* text:

[Adding multiple rates animation](https://cryptorates.ai/get-rates-loop.webp)

These of course can be converted to any currency; for example to get PancakeSwap in Euro (EUR):

    =QUERY(IMPORTDATA(""https://cryptorates.ai/files/standard.csv"", "","", ""en_US""), 
    ""SELECT Col3 WHERE Col1 = 'BTC'"", 0) * GOOGLEFINANCE(""USDEUR"")

If you want to track the rates of a lot of coins, it's best to use [the VLOOKUP method](https://cryptorates.ai/vlookup-method) to make things even faster.

I have also done a lot of work on the documentation, so please let me know if anything is unclear or you get stuck anywhere. Docs are here: https://cryptorates.ai/

Reddit,CryptoCurrency,Unmasking NFT Wash Trading,2024-10-08 20:50:49,"Dear community,

We're a team of researchers interested in infometrics, chainalysis, or colloquially analysis of blockchain data. I've made this account to post about our recent research on analysis of NFT trading networks and our findings in detecting potential illicit activity in NFT trading networks.  
This post is primarily aimed at providing educational material regarding NFT's and the authors are not blaming any particular NFT, creator, or project.

Traditional financial markets enjoy a significant presence of regulators enforcing a sea of illegal activity. However, most enforcing is trivial as user information is disclosed to regulating bodies linking each account to a real identity. Algorithms for detecting such patterns are not directly applicable to decentralized markets where only a pseudonymous identity is available. In other words, a user can have many wallets, and unless a centralized KYC platform is used, linking wallets to users is difficult. Prior research concentrated on examining NFT trading graphs to find recurring patterns that would indicate illegal activity. However, the ability to create wallets at fiat makes these efforts inadequate.

Our method takes a different approach. Here's how we did it.

# Our Approach: Linkability Network

The core of our method lies in the integration of **NFT trading graphs** with the entire **Ethereum Transaction Network**, creating a **Linkability Network**. Here’s how it works:

* **NFT Ownership Traces**: We track the historical transfers of ownership for each NFT, capturing every instance of trading or transfer.
* **Ethereum Transaction Network**: We extract and map the entire transaction history of Ethereum accounts involved in NFT trading, focusing on direct transfers of ETH between accounts.

The result is a directed graph that highlights potential collaborations or shared ownership across wallets that engage in wash trading. These connections, revealed through normal Ether transactions, indicate a high likelihood of coordination between wallets, even if no direct NFT trade is observed.

As commonly said, a picture tells a thousand words.

https://preview.redd.it/2ak5wznkhltd1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9555a299e406754f015e8bb8f516f40ac4b3091

The images above are examples of NFT trading graphs that our algorithm computes. The trades where the NFT was sold are edges colored red; the green edges are transfers between two accounts, and finally, the purple dotted lines are accounts historically linked on the Ethereum network. The proposition is simple: two or more accounts buying/selling/transferring the same NFT between them while having had transactions between in ETH is hardly a coincidence.

This usually happens when two or more wallets owned by the same entity/person continuously buy the same token from one-another. However, they can only do this if they have enough liquidity, or they send the ETH back and forth to fund the next buy.

The left graph shows how the first 9 accounts are all interlinked on the Ethereum transfers. These wallets were all participating in trading the token, resulting in a significant price increase. Finally, the last 3 trades are likely honest buyers that speculated on the continuation of the price action and are now holding the token, to this day, unable to sell due to lack of buyers.

Similarly, the graph on the right illustrates the same pattern amplified both in terms of value as well as trades.

The likability network was computed by following all transactions of each participating wallet until depth 4. This took a lot of time and significant computation power. For those interested, the [data of cca. 135k NFT's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/03370b71c433bfddf931292adbee759704774fa4b414174b14e3ff8946213d8b) and their graphs is publicly available, as is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16603) that goes into more detail.

In conclusion, it is unfortunate that many of the market participants were unaware about these practices. Hopefully, this post will help raise awareness about these practices for those of you trading NFT's.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

I feel like an idiot for not seeing the red flags early on before depositing $25,000 into their exchange. 

There is no information available about them on the internet currently and I'm hoping that this post will deter at least one person in the future from making the same mistake as me. 

After testing a few small withdrawals I deposited a larger amount into their platform. Once the time came to withdraw my funds in full they accused me of insider trading and blocked withdrawals on my account. 

I became suspicious and started researching them more thoroughly, turned out the awards on their website are fake, the company doesn't actually seem to be registered anywhere and the physical address on their website doesn't actually house their businesss.

They then said that I need to pay an ""insurance fee"" of 25% of the current account balance in order to unfreeze my account, which I did. Then they came to me again and said there was an issue with identifying the wallet which the deposit came from so I need to do it again. 

At this point I'm cutting my losses. A very bitter pill to swallow of course but I've learnt an important lesson in only using trusted and verified platforms for trading. I feel like an absolute idiot right now.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Lots of people believe this is technically possible - But for this to happen some indicators have got to be in Ethereums favor

EIP-4844 - proto-danksharding - dropped transaction costs and boosted Layer 2s potential to scale. Arbitrum, Optimism and recently even Base are getting more volume and all of this will make Ethereum dominate decentralized exchanges - It could double its current DEX volume relative to the mainnet

Following up on the Layer 2 topic - Ethereum keeps growing through its Layer 2 chains. Its possible that Layer 2s can handle more value and transactions than the mainnet in the future - But wouldnt that have a negative impact on the mainnet?

All things considering Bitcoin is still the favorite of institutional investors even though Ethereum has dominance in Defi and NFTs.

Does the amount to be “known” to be owned by Satoshi create an illusion that the market can be saturated at any time and the world turned upside down at a moments notice, thus preventing future Cold War-like peacocking-confrontations based off “current” knowledge of the market availability of the currency?

# India, Crypto, and the G20 Presidency

India was the first country in the G20 to call for regulation of the crypto economy, during its G20 Presidency. The idea was to bring together the top 20 economies of the world on the same page regarding regulation. That move augured well for the crypto enthusiasts in India as it was seen as the government leaning towards and accepting crypto as one of the realities of the economy.

https://preview.redd.it/xom3vysrijtd1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=637ac4a49e5bc191bf591996ada09794c0305f6c

While India did ban crypto in 2018 until it was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in 2020, there were no such steps taken thereafter. The closest India came to a ban was when International exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and seven others were banned from operating in India unless they registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). 

So, what is the state of crypto now?

https://preview.redd.it/jlu0w3kghjtd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fefbb55c5bed8125b38d778be8f51a240b8f55e

# Crypto in India | 2024 | And Forward

Nearly a year after the completion of India’s G20 Presidency, India seems to be committed to crypto regulations. The banning of the International Crypto Exchanges was seen as a step towards regulating crypto operations. Since the ban, Binance, KuCoin, and four other exchanges have already registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and started operations in India. The others will follow suit as well.

Not only is India committed to regulating crypto for its citizens, but it stays committed to the larger framework of crypto regulations across countries. To jog our memory, it was India during its G20 Presidency that worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – Financial Stability Board (IMF-FSB) to present a framework for crypto regulations across borders. This paper is still evolving and most of the framework was to be finalized by 2025. Thereafter, it is like a plug-and-play. Interested countries could join in and bring themselves under the global crypto regulatory environment.

So, all’s rosy then?

https://preview.redd.it/2l5f4uhlhjtd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4991cb3d0f456418ad74e8818be76aeba9e585

# Rosy and Cozy for Crypto? | Yes, but Not As Much

At least, the worry that crypto could be banned in India is a thing of the past. Now, the discussions revolve around regulation, taxation, lowering taxes, allowing more participants to join the crypto economy, and the like. Therefore, as a crypto player, it is indeed a heartening site.

Also, the regulatory framework gives a sense of confidence to crypto users. After all, it was just a couple of months ago that WazirX, one of India’s crypto exchanges was hacked and set back by roughly $240 million. WazirX is yet to open operations. That’s what could go wrong and this is why we need regulation in the crypto economy.

While users may be unhappy momentarily because of the taxes and also the regulatory framework they have to adhere to, over the longer term, this will only benefit them. So, all is good. And will remain good.

Rosy and cozy, therefore? Just about there! 😊

Reddit,crypto,[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,2023-06-11 22:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining.

Reddit,crypto,"When using Groth16, is it really needed to change both G₂ points of the public & private inputs in the trusted setup for avoiding public input forgery ?",2024-10-08 18:17:02,"First remember ᴇɪᴘ‒197 only allow to check if a set of pairings is equal to 1 in Fp^(12) and not to compare equalities like in Zcash which is why the equations below are different and would worth downvotes on a cryptographic sub as a result…

# For those who don’t know about Groth16 :

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ℓ elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them :

\[*a₁*,*a₂*,…,*a*ℓ\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes :

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations?

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems.

I was looking for a device-to-device encryption protocol to secure data transfer and I decided to explore Botan and try to use session keypairs or sender key methods in c++.

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

I was under the impression that if an efficient, large-scale quantum computer was built tomorrow, we wouldn't have an algorithm that couldn't just be cracked by Shor's algorithm, but I did more research and I'm pretty sure that's not true anymore. I wanted to get your guys' opinions, on whether or not we have encryption techniques that could be implemented once a quantum computer is manufactured. 

And kinda related question, would me saying that ""in the race between encryptors and cryptanalysts/hackers, the cryptanalysts/hackers are winning"", be objectively false?",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503
Reddit,crypto,Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,2024-09-08 09:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,crypto,Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,2024-09-05 16:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help.",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Reddit,crypto,Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,2024-08-29 08:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,crypto,Meta programming encryption technique assumption,2024-08-27 09:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify.

Reddit,crypto,Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,2024-08-10 01:24:46,"I’m in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present “new”/“novel” things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

Reddit,crypto,Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,2024-08-07 23:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Thank you for your time, and happy Meshing!",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,crypto,Why Not Use a Transpiler to Refactor Legacy Crypto Code?,2024-08-07 13:53:29,"We are aware that crypto code is vulnerable to classic exploits such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, memory leaks, etc. 

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

Reddit,crypto,What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,2024-08-03 22:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);
        record.write(signature);
        record.end_size_header();
        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?",2024-10-11 00:51:17.330503

Reddit,crypto,Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,2024-08-03 17:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

     n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (
        55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240,

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663
        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(p), [0,7]).order()
        115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?
